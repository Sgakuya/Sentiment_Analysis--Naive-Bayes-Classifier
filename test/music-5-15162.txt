I absolutely love Portishead and I believe this CD to be one of their best. (10 points to the smarty who can guess from which song I got my name)This band is innovation all the way, with songs that not only touch and inspire, but entertain. I know I can just pop in one of their CD's (espicially this one) and just chill..lay on my bed and have lovely calm moments with myself. This record is like my soundtrack. Sometimes, people hear CD's or songs and think, 'wow, I wish my life was like this'-not so much the lyrics, but the way the music flows and what it illicits inside them. I wish my life was like this.
