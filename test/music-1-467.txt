I am sorry to say that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have lost their spice. They have cut their hair, spiked it, and bleached the tips blonde. What can I say, they look like old men trying to be the preppy boys in my classes. Why? I don't know. But this song has become one of their many mass produced for my unenjoyment.
