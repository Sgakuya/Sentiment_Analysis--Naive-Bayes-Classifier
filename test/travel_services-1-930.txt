I rented a Budget truck one way from Ottawa, ON. to London, ON, and I wish I had rented an U-Haul truck, because it wouldn't make any difference except for the $300.00 more that I had to pay at Budget. The truck was awfully dirty, smelling of urine, and the truck accelerated much too fast, which made me spend more money on fuel. Not to mention that the form they filled out was wrong and led me to believe I had rented the wrong truck. Contacting Budget was hard and I also received an extensive phone-tree and waited on hold for about ten minutes. When I finally talked to a guy named Paul, the only thing he said was that he would return my call next day, which he obviously didn't. I called again and left a message. The next day a girl called me full of apologies, but never offered any compensation. This is my first and last time with Budget.
