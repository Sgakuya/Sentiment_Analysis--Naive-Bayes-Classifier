LOL @ the right wing pidgeons here who hide their heads in the sand about Ashcroft's assault on liberty, because he believes in talking donkeys and flying people with more lives than a cat. Newsflash, right-wingers: not everyone in this nation is Christian (thankfully, at least some people still believe in logic and reason, and don't base their lives on a book of fables. I used to be a minister in Ashcroft's religion, so I know what I speak of.) In fact, the vast majority of people in this nation are NOT Pentecostal, and DON'T share the view that a man in the sky says abortion is morally wrong. Also, LOL at the Democrats and Republicans trying to act like their parties are any different, and act like their parties give two sh!ts about the Constitution or liberty. Both of your parties supported the assault on liberty called the PATRIOT Act, and the leadership of both of your parties should rightfully be hung for treason.
