South Edmonton Common Tim Hortons 9:00am Order Extra Large Regular Coffee, double cream, double sugar. Server repeated order back to me. Get Large Regular Coffee with double cream, no sugar. 3rd time in last 3 visits to this location that my coffee size has been screwed up. That's a 100% goof up rate as far as my experience is concerned. It's always more polite to ask for the tip rather than stealing it!
