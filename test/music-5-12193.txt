If I could give it a 20, i would. Carl has opened my eyes to something different. I actually feel like now that i have his cd, i know just a little about him. When he sings, you can tell he is singing from the heart and the lyrics just sooth you. We need more Carls. Oh and i heard that he is dating Mary J. Blidge. Alot of people having been saying negative things about that. I just want to say, if anybody deserves a good man, you know it's Mary. Evidently she has something he wants. Stop hating!
