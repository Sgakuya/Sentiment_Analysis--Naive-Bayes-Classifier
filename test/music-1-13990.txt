Billy Joel's Greatest Hits, Vol. 1-2 (1985) is an excellent retrospective of his work from 1973 to 1985. The compilation covers some of Joel's better deeper cuts (eg Captain Jack, Say Goodbye To Hollywood, and Scenes From An Italian Restaurant), includes most of his big hits (eg Piano Man, Just The Way You Are, and It's Still Rock & Roll To Me), and features two previously unreleased tracks (eg The Night Is Still Young). While there are some notable omissions from this period (eg Honesty and Sometimes A Fantasy) and there is obviously nothing from his latter efforts (eg The River Of Dreams), most casual fans will be more than satisfied with the track selection. Nevertheless, in my opinion, no greatest hits package should be on this list as a compilation cannot really be compared to regular releases and does not represent the concept of a full-length effort.
