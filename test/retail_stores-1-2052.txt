Bought a camcorder and owned it for less than hours. Went to return it (it did not have very good quality) and was "informed" of Circuit City's 15% restocking fee. Circuit City NEVER told me of this "fee" when I bought the camcorder. Manager was ugly, beligerent and would not waive the "fee". Circuit City stole $75.00 from me because I was not happy with my purchase. I was treated awful and I will NEVER, EVER step foot in a Circuit City store again. Oh, and just for the record, if I had exchanged the camcorder the "restocking fee" mysteriously goes away. Which tells you is a bogus rip off and should be illegal - which it is in some states. Circuit City is going down the tubes because this is how the company treats customers.
