One would think that, as a Jewish refugee from Europe in the 1940's, she would have some sense of compassion for the sufferings of others. One would think that, as an immigrant, she would be sensitive to the importance of diversity and culture. One would think these things, but they'd be dead fu--ing wrong. Albright is a twisted psychopath who should have ended up in Auschwitz, so the world wouldn't have had to sit by and listen to her claim that 500,000 dead Iraqi children were a reasonable price to pay. It's only reasonable when you don't have to pay it, bi+ch.
