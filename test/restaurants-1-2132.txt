I have to add my disappointment regarding the new tea at Tim's. Extra large English Breakfast, Double-Double has been my saviour and treat for my three years of University. When I started to bang my head against my desk, it was time to walk over to the Student Union building, put down a loonie and find my sanity. I can't believe the nerve of decreasing their costs and increasing the price to customers by 50% and then putting out an advertising campaign trying to convince you that this is good. It's now the same price for me to go to the Starbucks on Campus with the comfy couches and quiet atmosphere and a discount for bringing in my own mug.
