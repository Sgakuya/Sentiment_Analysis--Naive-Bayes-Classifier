If I could give NEGATIVE stars, I would! This company is HORRENDOUS!!!! They claim Superior Service Commitment and total customer satisfaction as part of their Five Star Guarantee, but that's all a bunch of lies! My boyfriend and I went in to look at engagement rings, and, to my surprise, my boyfriend actually found one he thought was a good deal and agreed to buy it. After we applied for credit and purchased the ring... our account was actually charged for the ring... the mgr, Frank Lopez, realized he made a mistake and quoted us the wrong price for the ring. He said he wouldn't be able to sell us the ring (wanted to charge us $170 more). I argued that he'd ALREADY SOLD US THE RING... our acct was charged and papers were signed... but he refused to box up our ring. When we tried to complain to the regional mgr, Cynthia Vendenbroeck, she kept us on hold for over 20 minutes AND hung up on us TWICE! I've since tried contacting the VP, James Peregrino (the famous Mr. P.), and he refuses to take or return my calls. I would advise all consumers to check the BBB website for information before you make an important purchase. I see now that Crescent Jewelers has an unsatisfactory record with the BBB. I wish I'd known that before I went in! DO NOT BUY FROM CRESCENT!!!!
