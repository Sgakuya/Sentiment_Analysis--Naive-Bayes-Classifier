I don't believe there has ever been a performer from any genre or time throughout all of history, that could impact so many people, in a positive, uplifting way, with just the sound of his voice. The first time I heard him sing, I stopped dead in my tracks, and was mesmerized. I don't speak Itallian, and several of his songs are in that language, and it doesn't matter. I don't even care what the words are, my heart soars, just hearing his voice.
