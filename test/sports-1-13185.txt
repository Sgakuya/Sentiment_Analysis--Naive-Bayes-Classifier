I previously said that Texas A&M was the most disappointing team in the 05 season, but I'll change that to Tennessee. You see, Texas A&M has had a lot of season ending injuries to key starters. Tennessee has basically had all their players. They just haven't played like a team this year. Tennessee has become this year's Houston Texans of college football.
