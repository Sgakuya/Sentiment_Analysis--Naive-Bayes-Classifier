Just as someone said below, there's a reason Wal-Mart's stuff is so cheap - which is that companies often have separate, crappier production lines for stuff bound for Wal-Mart because they'd make no profit otherwise. If you shop here despite having Target nearby, something is terribly wrong. If you shop here because you have no other options in your area, I'm sorry.
