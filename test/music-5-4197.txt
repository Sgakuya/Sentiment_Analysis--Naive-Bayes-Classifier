I love this album. I know that it's not really a collection of ALL of his greatest, but every song on it falls into the my favorites section for me! I would have included Jungleland Sandy Rosalita I'm Goin Down Tunnel of Love and Reason to Believe but I still love what's on it. If you want a look at every side of Bruce's music, I guess this is a good sampler, but don't stop at this one, get Live 1975/85, Born to Run, Tunnel of Love and Born in the USA , too!
