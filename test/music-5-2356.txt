I thought it was great, Beautiful Sound is a good opener, and the title track is just plain fun. Forever Man is something different--listen to this song a lot, it grows on you. Good Stuff is catchy with good lyrics. The whole CD continues on in this way, with a lot of variety. I especially like Say You Need Love.
