Horrible. Spent 3.5 hours there on New Years eve. Biggest mistake of a dining choice ever. Our waitress took our appetizers away because our entrees were coming soon. They didn't show up for 45 minutes. She promised us free drinks to make up for the slow service and a few mix-ups and then changed her mind. Inexplicable.
