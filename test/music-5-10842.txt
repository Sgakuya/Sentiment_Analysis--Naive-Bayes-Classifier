I must say that this has to be one of the best CD's I have ever purchased. There isn't a single bad song on the entire album. Lifehouse is one of those bands that you can't help but like anything they do and thats what makes it so easy to put this CD in and just let it play. The lyrics to the songs hold so much meaning for anyone that listens to them because they can all be interpreted differently. Everyone sees things differently and relates to things differently... and that's what makes Lifehouse's lyrics so great... there isn't one set meaning to any of the songs.
