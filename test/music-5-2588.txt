The final album they recorded, Abbey Road is the last of the post-boy band Beatles albums I've purchased, and I think it's a dead heat with Pepper as their best. The Sun King medly is one of the masterpieces of rock music, I could listen to that over and over again. The segue from Pam to Window is what it's all about. Killer disc from the great recording act of all time.
