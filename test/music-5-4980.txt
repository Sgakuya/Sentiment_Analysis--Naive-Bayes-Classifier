Another winner from country music's most reliable singer. There are several great cuts on the cd: She Used To Say That To Me, Look Who's Back From Town, Tell Me Something Bad About Tulsa, As Far As It Goes, Desperately, and my personal favorite, Four Down and Twelve Across. There isn't a bad song on here, though I would have left off the last one, My Infinite Love. It's just too polished and sugary and it doesn't really go with the other tunes. Overall, however, this is a fine effort.
