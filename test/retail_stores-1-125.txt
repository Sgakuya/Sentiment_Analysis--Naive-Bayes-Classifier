Amazon does not/can not deliver/ship ordred items. Have ordered 7 - 10 items in the last 2 months that were all listed as normally ships in 24-hours. Still waiting on a couple! The Free Super Saver Shipping only makes things worse, you've waited 7 - 9 days before finding out Amazon.com has slipped the estimated ship dates - again. No clue what the deal is, but if you order tools or hardware from Amazon, you'd be better served to find a vendor who actually has the item in stock and can ship iot in a reasonable length of time (for reasonable shipping costs).
