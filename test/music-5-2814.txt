 This first Doors album and the last Doors album with Morrison called LA WOman are the best of the band's career. The rest are kind of sketchy. The Doors were extremely original. They did not listen to most ock/pop music with the exception of Love. They were mostly jazz/blues enthusiast. Combining those influences with the amazing poetry of Jim Morrison resulted in mostly brilliance!!
