Don't people care that this man ran a company (Goldman Sachs) that was in business to screw investors out of their money? Before he paid for his Senate seat, Corzine presided over plenty of hot internet and technology IPO's that ended up costing the public billions. Since he has plenty of his own money he has no qualms in advocating heavier taxes for those in the upper and middle classes who are still trying to make their fortunes.
