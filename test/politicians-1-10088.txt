George W. Bush has certainly set his share of records as president. He was the first president in our nations history to order an unprovoked attack and military occupation of a sovereign nation. He was also the first president to see more jobs lost than gained during his term since the great depression. During his first term, we spent the largest surplus in our nations history and also had the biggest annual deficit in our nations history. We had the most private bankruptcies filed during any U.S. presidency as well as the record for the most foreclosures. He took the most vacation days and the most campaign fund raising trips of any U.S. president. He was president during the biggest corporate stock market fraud in history (of any country). One of the worst offenders was Enron, the largest contributor to his first presidential campaign. He signed into law the largest overtime pay cut in U.S. history (Although 75% of Americans opposed it). Last year we experienced the largest trade deficit in U.S. history. And Dubya, who thought it was a good idea to spend over $150 billion (so far) to tear down and then rebuild Iraq, now wants to restructure our social security program and call out Iran and North Korea. It will be interesting to see how many more records this moron can set during his second term. To all you apologists who say But he is a strong leader, I say I would much rather have a wise one.
