Thanks, California...why can't your state deal with the consequences of its own actions? Your state created this problem with its half-assed de-regulation, (deregulated the supply-side, and not the demand-side...duh!) why can't you get yourselves out of it? Why did you have to try to steal money from the other 49 states to solve your troubles?
