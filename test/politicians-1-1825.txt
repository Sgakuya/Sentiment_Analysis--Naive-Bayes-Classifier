Exactly how this guy became governor of Massachusetts is beyond me, other than the fact that he had a pretty weak opponent. The epitome of the corporate looking yuppie Republican. Not a true far right ideologue perhaps. Similar in some ways to former governor Weld. Kinda reminds me of the Donald Trump pastiche in Gremlins 2! Absolutely ruthless positions on matters that affect working class people, the elderly,etc .
