Apparently the only source LanceRoxas has for informing his opinion of the president is Fox News or perhaps the RNC (his rave review of the current president -- remember, this guy actually LOST the popular election -- reads like a bio-sheet from Bush campaign public relations headquarters.) 1.4 million jobs gained in the past six months? Maybe...LanceRoxas sure seems impressed. But I'm sorry to say that putting that recent gain in jobs in context with the larger picture, namely, the NET jobs LOSS since 2001 is several times that number. Bush will end his term with a significant LOSS of jobs, not a gain. So, viewing the past six months alone, out of context with the past 3 1/2 years, yes, it looks ok. But context is necessary to determine the reliability of claims like these. I don't have time or patience to go through a point-by-point rebuttal of LanceRoxas Pollyanish rave review or the presidency of GWB, but suffice it to say that at least half of the voting public remains unconvinced of the integrity Bush has supposedly returned to the white house. The fact remains that the captain of this ship took us headlong into a war based on highly questionable intelligence, and, as the man in charge, he should be held responsible by the people of his country for it. When other nations cautioned us to let the work of the UN weapons inspectors continue until finished, Bush ignored them. When the rest of the world demanded that we refrain from rushing to judgement, Bush forged ahead with apparent disregard for both the seasoned advice of other experienced nations as well as the life and well-being of his own service people. When persons of conscience in his own contry, and, indeed, millions and millions of other people around the world, protested the march toward unilateral pre-emptive war, Bush responded by stating that he didn't rule by popular opinion. A person of integrity, it would seem, might accept responsibility for mistakes made on his watch, and even express regret for acting with such inpunity. But not the Bush administration...each individual on his team has consistently passed the buck and made excuses. But when nearing 1000 of his own soldiers are dead and 5,000 to 10,000 are seriously injured or permanently disabled as a result of the military action, it's time to apologize and own up to serious errors that exceed simple miscalculation. It's not an oops! It's a lot more serious than that, and it would be nice if someone in charge would admit the fact. Furthermore, when assessing the outcome of the war, 16 months into the Iraq presence, it doesn't seem nearly as joyous to the people of Iraq. If you ask the average Iraqi how liberated they feel right now, or if they're enjoying the freedom we have so benevolently granted them, I'm not sure they would see it that way. Yes, Saddam Hussein was a terrible man, and the people of Iraq and indeed the nations of the middle east are better off now that he is no longer in power. No abuse of power or office should be excused. Saddam should be punished for the misery his leadership has caused in his country. But the same standard should be applied to the leaders of the United States...
