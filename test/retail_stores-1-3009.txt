My Husband purchased me my wedding set which was 14 kt white gold the rings were suppose to have been about 1 and a half carats. The ring did not sparkle after many time of having it cleaned I was very unsatisfied with the quality of the ring. Me and my husband took the ring back to the Washington Square Mall In Indianapolis Indiana when we took the rings back to the store they were saying they had to see if we could return them but we had only had the rings for 3 days we had our receipts in hand they really had nasty attitudes. I wanted to exchange the rings for something else but the sells woman named Vanessa Williams acted like she was stuck on stupid she couldn't even answer a simple question. The sales people rushed us to buy our merchandise it was like we coludn't asked them in detail about the quality or about the carat weight or everything they were only interested in getting my husbands money. To everyone out there I say The Hell With Friedman's anyone with an account should not pay the bill the jewlery might turn your hands or arms green BEWARE OF THIS STORE. I WOULDN"T BURY MY WORST ENEMY IN THEIR MECHANDISE.....................
