Warren G. Harding was a genial man who never really wanted to be President, and proceeded to prove why he ought not to have been. Not to say that he did not make any wise decisions during his term as he chose able men such as Charles Evans Hughes, Herbert Hoover, and Andrew Mellon to his Cabinet. He also pushed for women's rights. That being said, he was a poor judge of character as his cronies, Harry M. Daugherty and Albert Fall, contributed to his Administration's disgrace through the Teapot Dome Scandal. He was also amoral, having fathered a child out of wedlock and denying it repeatedly. In short, Harding was unfit to be President.
