I bought a 98 accord ex v6 coupe and with only 55k miles, it needed a new transmission. Luckily the person I bouth it from had an extended warrenty which coverd most of the cost, but I was still without a car for a week. I bought a honda because of the great reliability and now with only 67k miles, I still feel problems with the trans. I don't drive my car hard and neither did the previous owner. Hopefully all you Honda lovers will prove me wrong but so far, no good.
