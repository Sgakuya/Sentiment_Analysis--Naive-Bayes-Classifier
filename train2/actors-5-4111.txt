John Cusack is a wonderful actor. He has the ability to make me think that whatever character he plays, I am still seeing the real John Cusack peeking through. The characters that he chooses to play have more than just a surface depth, they are always layered and we are priviledged to see those layers unfold through the course of his films. John Cusack just seems real, intelligent and very, very cool.
