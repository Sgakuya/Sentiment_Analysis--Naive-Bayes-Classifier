Incredibly weak. I frankly wonder what the point of even smoking these is; I am not a big smoker (in fact, I rarely smoke more than five cigarettes a day), yet I'm at a total loss if you ask me WHY one would want to smoke this ridiculous cigarettes: they are so weak, it's like putting paper in your mouth without even lighting it. In fact, they are so weak you can't even see smoke puffs coming out of your mouth. I know a person who has been smoking these for TEN years. Ridiculous. Like you know, how to do a small damage to your health without even enjoying anything. Please.
