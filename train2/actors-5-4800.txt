Just saw Cuba in Men of Honor . As he has been in everything else Cuba did an awesome job and has my deepest respect. He is a brilliant actor. I retired from the Navy as a Senior Chief earlier this year and felt he did an outstanding job in his role as a Chief/Senior Chief Petty Officer. Keep up the great work Cuba!
