I can't find enough words to say about this vixen truly gifted with acting prowess...Sure she may be larger than life and monomaniacal, but it was her persona and the greatest role she played was herself, and she acted it out to the hilt!I've only watched a couple of her films and a documentary about her, I just wish I could watch more of her. I'd like to see her life on film also, portrayed by SUSAN SARANDON and Drew Barrymore as the young Bette Davis!!!
