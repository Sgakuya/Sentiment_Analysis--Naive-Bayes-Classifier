Why does Hollywood insist on continually pushing stick chicks on us if a majority of the public can't stand them? Coincidence? I think not!! I have not seen Duets and don't plan on it. After being severely disappointed by Shakespeare In Love and Paltrow's performance, I hope to never see a film with her in it again. Question: Did she or Miramax pay off the Academy members for their votes or what? Maybe, it's just me that thinks this is the most insipid actress to ever grace the screen but I don't think so!
