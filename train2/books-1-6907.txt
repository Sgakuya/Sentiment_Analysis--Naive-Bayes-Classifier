Jordan is flogging a dead horse. Last I heard from an interview he was planning on 16-17 books to finish this series. Now with the prequel series that competes for his time writing the main books it looks the WoT franchise is his idea for income in old age. I wouldn't be surprised if he stretches the series out to 25 books or more. Skip Jordan if you haven't read anything already and get books from a truly talented writer - George R.R. Martin.
