I have just seen the movie Wit and am convined that it is not only the best written screenplay (co-written by Ms. Thompson) to date, but the best acted. It is nothing short of tragedy that Emma Thompson was denied the honor of best actress for this performance. It is the height of her genius and reflects an absolute undaunted spirit in the face of taboo subject matter in americana. Where by the way, death is in no way, a comma. Neither is Ms. Thompson's performance.
