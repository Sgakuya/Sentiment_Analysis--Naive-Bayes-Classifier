Sela Ward is a wonderful actress. Over the years I have greatly enjoyed seeing her in various roles. I was enrolled at the University of Alabama at the same time she was there. I didn't know her personally, but those that did spoke highly of her academic ability. My only regret concerning Sela is that she lost her wondeful accent!
