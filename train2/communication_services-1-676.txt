Cingular wireless is a SCAM, stay away from them. They will offer you the world and then say they have upgraded their technology so your old phones are locked into a plan you cant' get out of. I'm sick in tired of getting screwed by Cingular. They are the biggest scam artest of them all. Don't go with Cingular. Cingular SUCKS.
