Maurice is a great actor. If he didn't bring in the ratings, then GH would drop him. kolby1973's comment below that If he is on General Hospital, that is pretty much a sure sign he IS NOT going anywhere...very few soap stars do...afterall there is a reason why they are on soaps to begin with. NO TALENT ! is upsurd and unresearched. several talented stars got their start on daytime... demi moore, meg ryan, sarah michelle gellar, ryan philippe, Billy Dee Williams,Cicely Tyson , James Earl Jones,Laurence Fishburne,Phylicia Rashad,Lauryn Hill,Morgan Freeman, brad pitt, Anne Heche,Ray Liotta, Kyra Sedgwick, Faith Ford,Kelsey Grammer,Julianne Moore, kevin bacon, Marisa Tomei ,Susan Sarandon, Vivica A. Fox,Martin Sheen, Kathleen Turner, Vanessa Marcil,Alec Baldwin ,Tom Selleck,Ted Danson ,Leonardo DiCaprio ,Christian Slater ,and Calista Flockhart just to name a few. Daytime stars learn hundreds of lines every day, spend long hours at the studio and don't take time off for the summer. they deserve a lot more credit that they are given.
