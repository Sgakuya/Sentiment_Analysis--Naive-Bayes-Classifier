Wow. What a vivid story. I've never read such emotion and sensuality from a book. Every human sense; pleasure, pain, hunger, desire; Robert Morgan makes it so real you begin to live with his characters. I found myself getting hungry for fried chicken and bacon when I put the book down at 11:00 at night. Simple, everyday pleasures become more greatly appreciated when you read his words. When he writes about pain, you hurt some. When he writes about pleasure you feel every ounce of joy from it. Embarrasment, shame, humor...It's all there..Life is in his book and his book comes more to life with every page you turn. He is really a remarkable writer who can take common, every day things and make you feel like you're living the lives of his characters. You will learn to love these characters too, for how human they are. Most of all, you will love the book.
