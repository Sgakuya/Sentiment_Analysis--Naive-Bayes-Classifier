What a great book! I love Stehpen King's writing, and this was a sensation. I read the boom AFTER having seen the movie, so I sort of knew what to expect, and got a whole lot more than I had been expecting. The characters just seemed so real, and the dry sense of humor was terrific. John Coffey is one of the best inventions to come out of American literature, and his little soliloquoy near the end ( I'm rightly tired of the pain I hear and feel, boss... ) was incredibly moving and incredibly true. He felt all of the violence going on in the world, and if everybody had this power, perhaps it would stop. Take care, everyone!
