Ed is one of the few lost actors. he is incredibly talented but doesnt get enough recognition. Played the main role in Fight Club but brad pitt seemed to be the center of attention. in american history X a lost movie he plays a bigot. this is a very unappealing role but he does it well showing his incredibly versatility.
