My brother has lived here for only a few years and is now determind to move his wife and kids back North. I only went there once. georgiarocks, you claim everyone who gives Georgia a bad rating is judging it on Atlanta, well Atlanta is really bad and has traffic and crime and really sucks, and it is still the BEST part of Georgia. Try living in beatiful upstate ny and having everyone judge you bases on people from NYC! Yes, the pollen is the worst there as it is in all of the south.
