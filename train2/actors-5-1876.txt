Johnny Depp is such a fabulous actor: the most talented I have ever seen. You know, he is soooo hot and nice, handsome and awesome, specially with long hair (as Gilbert Grape, George Jung in Blow, Roux in Chocolat and Captain Jack Sparrow in POTC). His low-budgets show that he always picks different roles and likes to play strange characters - because he identifies himself with them! Despite his fourties, this man seems to be no more than 25, no doubt. I'm portuguese (15 years old) and lucky 'cause he's goin to film the movie The Gipsy Curse with Vanessa in Portugal! I'll try to meet him and his wife!! I'm looking forward to so... If only they needed extras... lool=))) How lucky you are Vanessa Paradis... I wish all good for him and his family=)
