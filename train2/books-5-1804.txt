This is one of the best comic strips of all time. I love the meaningful story lines. Johnston never avoids controversial topics. (Like when Lawerance disclosed he was gay) Johnston also does a great job in displaying the everyday normal family. The only criticism I would have is that the Johnston family seems way to functional (Most familes are dis-functional to a point.)
