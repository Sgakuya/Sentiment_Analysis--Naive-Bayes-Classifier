I love these guys. Fargo is probably the best film of the past ten years, while O Brother Where Art Thou is some clever, clever, 'feel good' stuff. Oh, the O Brother Soundtrack is superb, if you're into this genre of music, old timey Gospel. Big Lebowski is another one of my faves, but who could forget Raising Arizona? I love how they often work with same actors/actresses again and again, like John Goodman, and John Turturro, Frances McDormand, Holly Hunter. I think it's the sign of master direction when you find a good group and pretty much stick with them. Look at Hitchcock. How many films did he do with Grace, Cary and Jimmy??
