I love Chris Walken. He is an excellent actor, who deserves more praise, and more leading roles than he gets. Some of my favorites are Deer Hunter, Dead Zone and Brainstorm. I also enjoyed his off Broadway performances years back, in Hurlyburly and Cinders. And of course, his comedic talent shines on SNL. Also...love his dancing in the Fat Boy Slim video!
