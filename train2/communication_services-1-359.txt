Cellular-one is the worst excuse for a phone service I have ever seen. For the last 7 months, I've had nothing but problems recieving phone calls. My job depends on me recieving business call, but when I'm only recieving about half of my calls, my business hurts. They sent my phone to get fixed twice saying that it's the speaker. Both times, it was sent back saying that nothing was wrong with the phone. Yet, they can tell something is wrong when I call them up on thier 611# and they check it from there. They are not willing to go out of thier way to find out what the problem is, but they sure want thier money when the bill is due. And you can forget about getting out of the contract, unless you feel like forking over $200 bucks. The other 2 people that I work with are with Verizon and they have no complaints, and after my contract is over, that's where I'm, going and I'm telling everyone that I know, Do not get involved with Cellular-one. If you live in southern New Mexico, do your research before you try to save a few bucks and sign on with cell-1. Trust me, you'll thank me later. 2 plastic cups tied to a string is more reliable.
