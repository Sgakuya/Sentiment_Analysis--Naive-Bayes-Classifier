Tom Hanks is one of my favorite current actors.So far every role he has played is believable.Some of my favorite roles of his are for Forrest Gump, and Big,tom had the ability to get me to believe he was 12 in Big. He was wonderul as the kind,not to smart Forrest Gump.I also liked him in Sleepless in Seattle.he makes acting look so effortless.
