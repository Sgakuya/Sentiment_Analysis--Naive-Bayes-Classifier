One of the most talented actresses of her age group or any other. I agree - she looks really great for her 50+ years. You just knew she was bursting to say way more than she did at the Oscars - yet she had the guts and the class to play it low key on this occasion. She must realize like others apparently do not that, in order to be truly effective in life, you need to pick your battles as well as your battle grounds. Michael Moore might want to jot that down.
