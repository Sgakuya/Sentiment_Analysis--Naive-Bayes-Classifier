Did any of the other people reviewing these dinners ever actually EAT any of them??? It sends shivers up my spine just thinking about them! I bought the Banquet Swedish Meatballs dinner... it was the most horrendous excuse for frozen food I've ever tried in my life. The first thing I noticed was the smell... it was incredibly UNappetizing. But I decided to be brave and continue... The meatballs were multi-colored, which should have also tipped me off, but still I pressed on.. Then I tried it, took one bite, and threw the rest of it in the trash. And I do NOT throw away food! I wrote to complain to Banquet; they sent me a blah-blah-blah form letter and coupons for free dinners. I never used them. Even for free, I won't eat this stuff again! Bad, bad, bad. Do not subject yourself, or even your enemies to this nasty stuff. Bleccch!
