Ted King is the Most talented actor that Gh has added to it's canvas in years. The depth he gives to his character is awesome and he plays each type of scene to perfection and he never mumbles or forgets lines. I truly admire his professionalism and respect this Talented Actor's contributions. He alone has kept me from completely tuning out GH. I'm looking forward to watching him soon be in the Lead Actor Category. Angel48035
