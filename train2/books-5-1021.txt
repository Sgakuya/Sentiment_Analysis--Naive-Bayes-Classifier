I love this book. It is so sad. I have read the book several times. I basically know it off heart. I think that this book is even sadder then Old Yeller and that is saying something. I know that I will enjoy reading it again. And I hope that by my recommendation that many others will read this book and come to love it as much as I have. It is so unbelievably sad. But that is one of things that I love about it.
