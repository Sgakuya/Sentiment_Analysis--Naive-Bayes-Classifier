I bet most of the good comments on this page are either BMW reps or people with less than 30K miles on thier vehicles. I have spoke to tons of owners, 24 hour road side assistant reps and all indications point ot the fact that the X-5 is junk. I will admit it is fun to drive and looks good but is depressingly unreliable for the price and BMW USA was a nightmare to deal with. I sold it today and bought an AUDI.
