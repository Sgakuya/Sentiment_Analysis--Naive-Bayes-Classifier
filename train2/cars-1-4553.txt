Owned a bunch of Ford's then I bought the Rock . I listened to them GM people tell me how it was going to be the top selling pickup but like the rock (or is it boulder) it still hasn't budged on the sales chart. I wonder why? Maybe its the conservative styling? My guess it's the cheap looking corporate steering wheel (same as the Escallade). Oh the HD's are almost here 4 years after Ford and Dodge so now the GM's (GMC Chevy) will outsell Ford . If that happens maybe I'll stick with Chevy otherwise it's back to a good old dependable FORD. I want to be with the leader!
