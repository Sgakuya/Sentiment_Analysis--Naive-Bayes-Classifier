I work at the University of Phoenix. I am not a recruiter but work closely with the students and I have to tell you this place is a joke. The recruitment push is like that you would imagine at a used car lot. There is absolutely no sense of ACADEMIA here. The theme of the university is "We Graduate Students". There is however no education going on. Most of the students in the undergrad programs cannot write at a high school sophomore level. I am at work right now and there is a class group that shows up on class night every week and rushes to do there paper in the computer lab during class time while class is being held. Most of the education here appears to be centered on Powerpoint presentations and oral reports (on the level of the kind you did in the 6th grade). I feel most for those going for their MBA's and MAED's. Many came from traditional colleges (National and regional top 1 & 2 tier schools). They should know better. This is a second, part-time job for me. I would not hire any of the graduates from this university because they have not been educated. Many of the students work in local social services or very large corporations where a "degree" will help in promotion to lower level managerial positions. Look. In the area where I am, there are a plethora of state colleges, private colleges and other options that offer the convenience that UOP does and for a whole lot cheaper. Explore other options before partaking in this expensive rip.
