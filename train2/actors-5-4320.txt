How to get elected as a Republican if there is a popular Democratic incumbent administration in office, the economy is good and you are behind in the poles in September: A. Plant -this- seed of thought with the voters:The American military is in a state of decay. B. Employ your influence with foreign dictators (that you have kept in power) to start unrest. C. Instruct these dictators to stage an act of terrorism that causes fat but nervous financial markets to tank. D. Count on the fact that the short attention span of the American public will be focused on the results of your deeds during election time. BTW- THE CONTENDER, just saw it. In my opinion some of the finest acting ever seen on screen. Gary Oldman is a true actor in the finest sense of the word. If you didn t know who he was ,you wouldn t know who he was. I am now also voting for Jeff Bridges for President. Screenplay ain t bad either.
