What a short, direct, amazing book. I'm always impressed when an author can tell a deeply emotional story with such simplicity and economy of words - Hemingway's specialty. In high school, this was my favorite Hemingway novel. In college, I think my favorite switched to The Sun Also Rises. And then it switched again to For Whom the Bell Tolls. But now, almost 10 years after college, I think I'm back where I started, because Old Man and the Sea does more with less. It has a tragic quality, but at the same time I feel uplifted at the end. And I have a feeling I'm going to appreciate this book even more as I get older.
