Great place to go to escape the cold for a week or two, but that is it!! It is a melting pot of people from New York and Boston with the most ANNOYING accents, and immigrants who are uneducated and cannot speak any english. The drivers here are the worst anywhere in the country and the I95 is deadly. I have nothing against the elderly, but many of these people just shouldn't be driving. They are a hazard to themselves and to the other drivers on the road. Extremely low-paying jobs if any. The little jobs that are available are taken by the immigrants because they will accept the lower pay. I can't wait to get out!
