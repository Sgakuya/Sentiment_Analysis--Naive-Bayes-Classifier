I first noticed Kevin Spacey in the movie see no evil, hear no evil . I didn't know who he was at the time, but one scene made an impression that made me look for his performances in the future. the scene of the woman taking her clothes off and Kevin Spacey looks at her breasts with this look and a sigh.. amazing! what an actor. he reminds me of Spencer Tracey :o)
