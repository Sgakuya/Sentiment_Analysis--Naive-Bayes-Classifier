dodge service sucks. i bought a 2004 ram 1500 in november of 2003.the brakes have frozen on me 3 times since then and after fixing different things but obviously not fixing the problem they are telling me i contamitated my brake fluid with some other substance and i have to pay well over $ 2000.00 to replace my whole brake system.what a scam
