I think Wes is one of the most promising upcoming actors of today. Although he doesn't have a wide range of films, he does have a large number of fans that support him greatly. He was excellent in American Beauty and I'm sure he'll be just as good in his upcoming films. Be sure to watch for Soul Survivors , The White River Kid (may not be released in theaters) and the Michael Winterbottom project Kingdom Come (working title) And please check out my Wes fansite, got Wes? at http://www.geocities.com/wesbentleynum1
