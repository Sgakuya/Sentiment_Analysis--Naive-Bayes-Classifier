The first movie I ever saw with Emma Thompson in was Dead Again. Phenominal movie. And since then I've loved the way she comes off on screen. Confident yet humble.. beautiful.. tasteful.. a true lady.. through and through. It's rare to see a woman really act like a lady in Hollywood.. what a role model.
