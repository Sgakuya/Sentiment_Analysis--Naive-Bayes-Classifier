The alltime best! I can watch her films over and over, again! Even Bette Davis was a great admirer, stating that Miss Hepburn gave, by far, the best female performance of the year,1935, for Alice Adams. That was the year Miss Davis won a consolation oscar, for Dangerous. Among my many favorite Hepburn portrayals, is in The Rainmaker. She totally captured the desperate emotions of an insecure ugly duckling, who nevertheless had much inner beauty. And Burt Lancaster, in the title role, coaxed that trait out of her.
