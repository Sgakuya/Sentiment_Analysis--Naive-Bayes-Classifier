Shirley was indisputably the best child star of all time. Along with being a top-notch dancer (especially with Bill Bojangles Robinson) her acting was exceptionally above and beyond, and she was right up there with many of the adult stars in her era (Clark Gable, Alice Faye, etc.)..... better have some tissues ready before you sit down to watch her movies!
