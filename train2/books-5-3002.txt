absolutely a gem! this was the first book by stephen king that i read, and it was right after it was first published...it IS scary, in fact, i was laying on the bed reading it one night, we did not yet have curtains on the windows, and i found myself constantly stealing sideways glances at the windows... my wife came in behind me and threw her handbag on the bed... well, you can still see the twenty gouge marks on the ceiling where i hung suspended for about 10 seconds before falling back on the bead in a faint....this was 27 years ago, and i still have deep psychological scars....
