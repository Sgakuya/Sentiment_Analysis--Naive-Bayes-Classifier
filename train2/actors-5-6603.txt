I can't believe Hugh thinks about retiring from acting sometimes. That would be truly sad...I like this actor despite some of the bad press he's received about his shenanigans with with a hooker. He's the epitome of the typically slightly self concious reserved Brit, yet he also has a great sense of humour, especially when it comes to himself.He can act thats for sure, but can he sing????
