To say that Denzel is highly overrated of an actor, I could name many more actors who are far worse when it comes to acting. I disagree with a few posters, that think that Denzel is overrated, because looking at many of the movies that he has made he has either made a movie better with his presence and talent. And I have seen him hold his own with very good, if not great actors, Gene Hackman. So I rate Denzel great.
