Burroughs' is an over-rated, romanticized junkie who's added little to classic literature other than cheapen it with passe shock value. This book is huge with impressionable, pretentious, anarcho-syndicalist types who wish to glorify smashing the state, the patriarchy, and whatever other mythical oppressor is out to dog them.
