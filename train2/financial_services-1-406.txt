I wonder if that same broker came to Fresno. UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. hired a CPA Broker that made unauthorized trades and took senior out of AAA Tax Free California Bonds and put her in B Bond mutual funds saying they were safe and secure. Lost over $60,000 and company wanted her to join with them against this broker when they fired him because of missing funds in another senior's account. They would not return the money that was dishonestly taken. It now goes to the NASD. and SEC.
