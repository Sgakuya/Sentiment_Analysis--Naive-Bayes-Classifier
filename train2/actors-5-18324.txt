THE MASTER OF SUSPENCE! Truely, the greatest director and showman of our times. This man was a marvel. His work is absolute art and has proven to stand the test of time. No director has ever, I repeat, ever been able to match this mans talent,style,simplicity and capability to draw an audience in completly. Suspence is dead these days. Mr.Hitchcock, as far as I am concerned, mastered the art of suspence. He knew how to keep everyone in the theater on edge. Alfred Hitchcock is a pure and completly astonishing genius. Some directors have tried, some have completly ripped off (I'm not going to name names,...Cough,cough,Van Sant,Cough.)but no one will ever out do the original. HE IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE MAN!
