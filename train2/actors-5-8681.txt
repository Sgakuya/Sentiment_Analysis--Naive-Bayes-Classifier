I admit it. I adore Lana Turner. So she lacks the range of a Hepburn or Davis, but when Lana was onscreen, you couldn't take your eyes off of her. And when she DID nail a part, she could be incredible. See her act up a storm in Zeigfeld Girl, The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Bad the Beautiful, Peyton Place, and Imitation of Life.
