This guy was obnoxious on that notably vomitous NBC show that he had, and he went on to somewhat obscure, but equally pukey projects ever since. This is a sawed-off, shrimpy little dwarf whose head you'd just love to flush down the toilet repeatedly. I have never seen him perform yet in a way that was compelling, convincing, funny or entertaining. Just smug and self-impressed. Truly less than zero.
