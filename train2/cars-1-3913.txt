Jkooks said it all- unless you are Apu and have eight kids, why do you need a car this size unless you are just trying to get attention? Believe me, most of the time, it's not the kind of attention you want. If I can fit two baby car seats, landscaping bushes and $200 worth of groceries into my compact car, then there is no excuse for all these vapid, aging soccer moms who drive around my town in these cars with cell-phones plastered to their ears.
