You've got to give credit where credit is due. This guy was a class act. Every woman adored him, every man wanted to be him. And he could act too. Comedies, dramas, thrillers (i.e. Hitchcock). Not the every man that Jimmy Stewart was, who is my other favorite actor of the classic era. Seeing them together in The Philadelphia Story remains a total joy.
