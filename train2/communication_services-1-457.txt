My experience with Virgin Mobile was great right up until I had to deal with their customer service. I moved and after settling in at my new place needed to change the credit card for billing. The only way to do this is on the website. Unfortunately, in the process of moving, I had lost my vKey and somehow forgotten the answer to my security question. After repeated calls including speaking with a supervisor, there is apparently no process for emailing or resetting a password, supposedly for "security reasons". Never mind the fact that nearly every other e-commerce site on the planet has some method for retrieving a forgotten password or otherwise resetting an account. Without the answer to the security question, there was absolutely nothing customer service could do. Never mind the fact that I could give them every single personal detail, fax them a bill and call them on the cell phone for the account. The only option was to let the phone expire by not topping it off (which it would fail to do automatically because the credit card I wanted to change was no longer valid) and then sign up again. At that point, I would be (presumably) sent information to log in to the account and would (allegedly) keep the existing balance since it would be a reactivation of an existing account. Given the poor level of service, I've let my account lapse and won't be using Virgin Mobile ever again.
