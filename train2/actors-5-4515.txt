He has proven to be a great talent not so much by being a star sensation (until Lord of the Rings), but by proving this through his craft. I immensely enjoyed him as a child acting prodigy. His turn in The War and The Good Son merits his position as probably one of the best child actors, only second to Anna Paquin (The Piano) by a smidgeon. I think he has grown up gracefully onscreen and has remained grounded. He hasn't had a stint in rehab or done drugs or had his face plastered in tabloids for DUI and such. I commend him for having made a great transition to his adult career. Kudos to you Elijah.
