Brad Pitt is quite simply one of the greatest screen actors of our time. He has proven that he is a versatile actor with the roles he has received. As for the people who say he is a bad actor, I suggest the remove their heads from their a$$es, stop watching their midget p0rn, and go watch Ocean's Eleven, or Fight Club, or Seven, and then come back and try to say he is a bad actor. You people need to pay attention to the movies and the dialogue of these movies to be able to appreciate them.
