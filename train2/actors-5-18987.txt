It's amusing to watch the Right telling Michael Moore he ought to honor his First Amendment rights by shutting the hell up, when their own media pets--Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Gordon Liddy, Cal Thomas, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., are AT LEAST as obnoxious and outrageous in their own (extreme) right. Should we consider the source, and take Moore's statements with a grain of salt? Absolutely. The same is also true of the far-right-wing provocateurs listed above and all their brethren, which at this point in our history greatly outnumber their left-wing opponents, both in number and audience size--and whose outrageous pronouncements tend to be accepted by their followers as gospel truth, even when their falsity is easily demonstrated. The trouble with our national discourse is that too few people apply any kind of critical intelligence to what they hear on the radio or see on the tube. One reason for this is that the mainstream media has gotten really good at spoon-feeding the public what used to be called the establishment line, another is the current drastic imbalance in the kind of extremist views that are being heard. The extreme Right is frighteningly well represented in the media, but though there is no shortage of responsible liberal commentators (the type a true leftist would dismiss as centrist, or middle-of-the-road ), there are no left-wing firebrands, no entertainingly obnoxious polemical blowhards with anything close to Mr. Limbaugh's reach. Moore is as close as the Left gets. The national debate NEEDS him; what's more, it could use about a dozen MORE of him, out there getting in people's faces on a daily basis. Maybe then tht right-wing commentators' fans would, by comparison, be better able to see their own extremism for what it is; and maybe we might come as a nation to realize that the truth lies somewhere BETWEEN the two noisy extremes.
