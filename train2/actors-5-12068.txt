Wynona is a wonderful actress. She has been an inspiration to me through her work. With her great personality, quick wit, humorously outspoken and also dramatical roles she has touched the audiences who watch her. My Wynona favorites include Beetle Juice, Heather's, Mermaids, Edward Scissorhands, Little Women, Reality Bites, GirlInterrupted, and what I believe was one of her best acting roles, in BRAMSTOKER'S DRACULA. I wish her the best of luck with Heather's 2.
