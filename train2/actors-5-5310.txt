Robert Downey Jr. has been called the greatest actor of his generation for a reason. He's so multi-talented. He's an incredible actor and can easily do a variety of roles from drama to comedy to action, from the movie screen to a TV screen. His voice as a singer is truly beautiful, soulfull and heartfelt. He played his own piano composition in Two Girls and a Guy. He also sang in the movie and did a little preview of Hamlet. And who can forget the amazing mirror scene. And all the amazing singing on Ally McBeal: River, Chances Are, Sherry Darling, his duet with Sting on Every Breath You Take. His own song Snakes on the Ally McBeal CD is breathless. He's played Chaplin the little Tramp, he's cracked us up as Tommy in Home for the Holidays, he made us cry in Less Than Zero, he made us fall in love with him in Only You, he was adorable in Chances Are, he emerged himself in 4 different characters in Heart and Souls, he took us to the Land of Mar in Restoration and he made us belive in that once in a lifetime love on Ally McBeal. He's an incredible presence in every movie he's in and he lights up the screen and steals every scene so flawlessly. He's a true pleasure to watch. I believe in him and I support him all the way, always and forever.
