I have watched GH since 1986 and the only reason I have continued to do so lately is Ted King. I love the pairing of Carly and Lorenzo and hope that we get that wonder pairing again but if not I still think Ted King is the greatest actor on GH right now. He is fun to watch a great actor, the day in the park with Courtney informing her that he has been the only one thinking of Carly was perfection, he is also the sexiest man on daytime! I am saddened that he has not been given more air time
