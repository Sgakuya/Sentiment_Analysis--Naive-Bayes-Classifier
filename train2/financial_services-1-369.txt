This is the worst bank I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. They played bait and switch with a mortgage refinance package and then refused to refund my 500 dollar deposit when I balked at the new terms. Now I have to drag them to small claims court to get a refund which by law and by their own policies I am entitled too. Terrible customer service . BEWARE
