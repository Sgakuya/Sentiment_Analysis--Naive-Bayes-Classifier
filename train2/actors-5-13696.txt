I should probably give her no better than a 4 when considering her complete body of work to date. Her performances on both Mummy movies were outstanding and I thoroughly enjoyed her in Chain Reaction although the movie itself was not that great. She has been in a few really bad movies such as Death machine but that was early in her career. Having stuck to sci-fi type movies early on it is good to see her moving towards more dramatic roles where her true talent can be fully assessed.
