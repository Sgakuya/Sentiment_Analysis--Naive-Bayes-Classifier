I bought a 2000 1100 STX DI. The ski worked perfectly for three seasons, minus a bad solenoid. However, the 4th season has brought me much anger. After having the ski winterized at an authorized Kawasaki dealer, the ski engine blew within 5 minutes of running this spring. There is no excuse for a moderately used ski to blow it's engine after three seasons of use and proper maintenance. Neither Kawasaki nor their authorized dealer will take the blame or help with the problem. I think Kawasaki SUCKS and their dealers do too. I just bought the Honda 4 stroke and will NEVER buy another Kawasaki product. Also, stay away from Pete's Cycles in Severna Park Maryland. They are unqualified and the biggest bunch of jack asses I've ever met.
