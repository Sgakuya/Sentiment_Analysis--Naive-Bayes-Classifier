Such a horrible place to live. I have never encountered such rude, discourteous and cold people in my life. None of my neighbors would talk to one another, this hell-hole is segregated, traffic, smog...oh..the horrible laundry list of LA could go on and on. LA is also beauracratic, and you have to talk politically correct. Ex..It's not a freeway, it's a roadway!. And last but not least, there are jerks who dominate this city. Jerks who walk 1mm pass you and say excuse me. Gosh, I hope a huge quake shakes this fugly city for giving me a hard time.
