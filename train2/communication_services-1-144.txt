Horrible, I lose service EVERY time there is an electrial strom. The router can't handle any strees and have been replaced 6 times. The costumer service blows and run you around in circles and can never solve the problem so they just send another router to replace the broken one, mean while you have no phone for a few days while you wait for the replacement router, Horrible, this technology will never replace the regular phone company....
