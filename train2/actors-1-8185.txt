What a horrible person! Can she even be considered a human? I can't imagine what those poor American POWs were going through when they reached out for help through notes. They saw a familiar face and thought she could help them. And that b*tch coldly handed the notes to their captors? How cold-hearted and cruel can you possibly be? Even if she didn't support the war, she should have still supported our soldiers. She got several of our own American soldiers beaten to bloody pulps. I think she should go to her deathbed knowing the guilt of what she did.
