Two things make up Alec Baldwin: A has-been actor and a nitwit. It's pretty pathetic when your last movie was Thomas:the train engine or whatever you call him. Also, if he can't accept the fact that somebody was rightfully voted in as presidet, then leave. We don't need antipatriots like him in our country. Hey Alec, I dare you to find a country that is more loose on freedom than the U.S. cause you won't. Anyone who loves freedom ought to rub this in his face.
