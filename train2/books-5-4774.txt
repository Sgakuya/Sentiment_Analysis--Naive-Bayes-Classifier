One of the fiercest attacks on humanity ever written. The King of Brobdingnag summed it up well: I cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth. This IS what Swift thought of the human race. By far the greatest section of the book is the last, the bitter, terrible visit to the land of the Houyhnhnms: when I read it I feel sad for Swift and the hate he clearly felt for mankind, and which he justified with such awful clarity.
