The most versatile actor of this generation. He has excelled in silly comedies (Bosum Buddies, Big, Bachelor Party), romantic comedies (Sleepless in Seattle, Splash, You've Got Mail), and wide ranging dramas (Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, Green Mile). Not only can he win an Oscar every year, but he seems so grounded (as much as someone at his level can be) and ALWAYS says the right thing. He seems like a guy that all of his would want to be friends with.
