Robert Redford is one of America's few intelligent actor/directors.....and hence, the crowd he appeals to. I also admire his work for native Americans and the environment. We are also blessed with his outstanding artistic ability as demonstrated in all his movies especially his cinamatography in the Horse Whisperer; fabulous. Exemplars are scare and grow better with age and I look forward to everything he puts out. He will always be one of my favorite and I invite him to dinner the next time he is in Northampton, Massachusetts! Professor Diane Weir, Nutritionist.
