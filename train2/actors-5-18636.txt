Now, here's a case where Hollywood really appeared to throw a curve. No disrespect to his early acting years intended but, cute little Opie Taylor + dorky, good natured teenager Ritchie Cunningham does not seem to add up to gifted director Ron Howard. Yet, there you have it. I have enjoyed not all, but very much of his work over the years - Parenthood and Cocoon being among my favorites. Even the stuff I didn't personally care for - Splash and Night Shift to name two - are better than much of the tripe we see as an alternative choice. I would definitely put him in the class of the most superior and decent Tinsel Town has to offer - and that goes for his ability to direct as well as his aptitude for remaining an unspoiled and very respectable human being.
