A University without a library or librarian cannot call itself a University. DeVry is just a mere institution. Look at Harvard, Stanford, and even local state schools! They all value their libraries enough to have actual professional staff. DeVry is a sad sad place. The education is worthless. Don't do it. You are all too smart for falling in this trap. Stay far a way.
