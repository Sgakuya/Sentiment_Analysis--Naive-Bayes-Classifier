Why anyone would want to live in this over-taxed,liberal hell hole is beyond me. I used to have to fly into that dump of an airport, Logan Field, a dozen times a year. Then drive through those assinine tunnels. Big Dig my butt. Wooburn, Peebadee. Dumb assed Massholes can't even speak english. No wonder they elect imbeciles like Kerry and Kennedy. Cut it off and let it float in the Atlantic all the way to Europe. They'd be happier there.
