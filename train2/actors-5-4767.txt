Happiness for me would be to find a rather scantily clad Hugh Jackman waiting for me in my king sized retreat after a long day with the kids...better than calgon I say. Oh by the way, he is a great actor, sexy, charming, and only 6 years younger than me...is that called the Demi Moore complex???? Well I'm guilty as charged! Hugh! Your wife is one lucky woman!
