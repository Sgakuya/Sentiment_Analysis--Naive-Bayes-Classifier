While SprintPCS acknowledges (in January 2001) that is has network problems in Chicago(mainly related to congestion through overselling the product) it continues to heavily market the service in Chicago causing fast busies and calls going directly to voicemail. SprintPCS has excellent pricing plans; however, all the minutes in the world aren't helpful if you can't place or receive calls. Also, I had problems recently when roaming in SprintPCS' corporate hometown of Kansas City.
