Suana Flannery has to be the Grestest Actress ever given to the entertainment industry. I have followed her career from Anatomy to Bold and Beautiful. Every roll she is given she embraces to the fulllest extent and make it her own. She will thrill you, make you cry, make you have so many emotions at once you can't stand it. She is the best there is. 2003 Emmy Nomination and I am sure the winner. I Love that Lady. Thanks Susan for all you do.
