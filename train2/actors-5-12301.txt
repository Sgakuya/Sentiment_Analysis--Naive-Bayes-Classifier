I think Halle Berry is a great actress who really brings to life each role that she portrays. I love her hair, I have just recently cut my almost waist length hair just like hers I was sceptical at first but now I feel so free and sexy it is just amazing. Her sense of style is outstanding she is always dressed for the occasion. I just think she is fantastic.
