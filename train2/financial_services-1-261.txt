I have been charged $33 for NSF fees more than I can imagine. I finally caught why. Seems that there is a lot of balance adjustment going on in the background the customer is unaware of and it is difficult to ever get an accurate balance off the web. Just found out why, that they will credit a charge if they do not get the hard copy within 24 hours but they do not tell you they credited your account; you think you have money because they say so, but then they will debit again,
