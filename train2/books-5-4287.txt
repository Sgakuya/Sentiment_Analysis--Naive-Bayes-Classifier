A tiny, shocking book that uses simple language and an economy of words to describe the horror of the Holocaust. For me, this book was an eye-opener when I read it in junior high school. I hadn t realized 20th century human beings were capable of such boundless cruelty. History books taught me the basic facts of the Holocaust, but Night gave it a living face and forced me to try to grapple with the fact that evil can still manifest itself on such a large scale. Night is the best Holocaust book I ve ever read, although I d also recommend Man s Search For Meaning by Victor Frankl another short book that fully describes the horror while also showing that the human spirit can survive Hell on earth.
