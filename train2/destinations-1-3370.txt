OMG...this place is so terrible, I don't see how some of you can live in this rathole. While I was in DC, I heard so many gun shots at night, drug dealers roaming the streets, my frind almost got mugged and the Russian embassy was fire-bombed by a group of thugs! Also where corrupt piggy-back politicians thrive in this sulfuric smelly sewage epicenter.
