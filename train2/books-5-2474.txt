I've always loved the Family Circus. When I was a child, and first learning to 'read' the comics, I could often 'read' Family Circus without needing to read it! The storys were about kids just like me, and I understood it. Unlike most of the others. Now that I'm an adult, sure, the strips tell the same story over and over in different ways, but the story is about life, specifically, life with kids. I read it, and envision the future when I have the same.. wonderful?.. experiences with my own child. My favorite strips were always the ones with 'ida no' and 'knot me'.
