We enjoyed the comic strip for years and even collect some of the books of the compiled strips. Some are real funny. A couple i have to look at for a few seconds before I get It good strip though.Fun for the adults to enjoy.GAry Larsons humor can be a bit weird, but I cannot help but laugh out loud at some of it.We like to get the 365 day calendar to read one every day. Too bad he does not want to do the strip anymore.
