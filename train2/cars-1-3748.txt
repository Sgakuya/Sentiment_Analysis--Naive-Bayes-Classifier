This is a free country and people can drive whatever they want but, What a stupid vehicle!!! A perfect metaphor for this country's lack of common sense with cars. The only person who appeared justified in having one on this site was the woman who lives in the Canadian wilderness. For everyone else who lives in paved civilization, get real. SUV's have proven high roll-over rates, cause more serious injury to victims in smaller cars (risk of decapitation goes up when SUV's are involved) and of course have horrendous gas mileage. They hog up the road, are a pain to park and nobody can see around them. There is no jealousy involved whatsoever in my extreme dislike of SUV's, I just happen to like using common sense when choosing a vehicle and not try to flaunt my wealth or whatever you want to call it. SUV s are the worst invention to come around since the parking meter and I'm not in a tiny minority with my opinion either.
