uhhh ever hear of the TRV from britain that is 810 hp and hits 242. hmmmmm do your research and the supra will not hit 183 stock please you have to chip it and mod it for that and why would you wanna drive a car that looks like a killer whale on speed. Whoever the design team leader for the latest supra should be black marked for life. It takes a body kit to make the supra even ok to look at but then it has to have 18s on it also. Stock it is nasty!!
