I think that Reese Witherspoon is a fantastic actress. I have not seen her give a bad performance in any of her movies. She has been amazing in all her roles, with The Man in the Moon , Freeway , Election and Legally Blonde standing out. She is one of the most versitle actresses I have ever seen. She rarely takes the same role twice and has the ability to shine in both comedy and drama. Even at such a young age she has managed to compile a very impresseive career and will no doubt continue to captivate audiences around the world. She also has a uniqueness and charm about her that is very appealing. You can't help but adore her for who she is and admire her for what she has accomplished!
