I totally don't understand you people this is ABOUT HIS ACTING NOT ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS WHEN HE IS NOT ON THE SCREEN!!!! This is a rating thing about actors just in case you have forgotten. and alec is an excellent actor, now what he does and says might be wrong but who are you all to judge him for that on a rating of his acting roles. give me a break this is not a venting room!!!!
