No, no, no you can't do no better than this. Calvin and Hobbes is as good as it gets. The creme de la creme. The Everrest of cartooning. Always original, always hilarious, always something to look forward to and always filled with crazy hijinks by that little rascal Calvin and it mischevious tiger Hobbes. Perfect!
