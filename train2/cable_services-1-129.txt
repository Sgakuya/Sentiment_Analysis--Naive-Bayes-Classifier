You bunch of suckers. Those lawyered up board members in charge of Directv are theives. Directv has annual commitments, hidden fees, and unreasonable package prices. A few days ago they changed the prices for the spanish speaking people. If they don't want to change then they can't add any premium movie packages or receive discounts until they change. The only thing Directv is better is in its picture quality. I have so many things to say and I would like to answer some of you people questions if you have any. I quit being a "Directv Customer Service Representative" yesterday, and I was one for a year. I don't like how I have to clean up after their mess. If you have any questions just pm me.
