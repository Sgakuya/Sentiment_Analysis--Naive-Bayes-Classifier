Kevin has the ability to be absolutely convincing, no matter what role he plays. He is a possitively supurb actor. Why anyone would say otherwise is beyond me entirely. Yes, perhaps he is not the absolutely greatest looking man in Hollywood. But why should that be a judegment on his acting ability. He's great and everyone should know it!!!!
