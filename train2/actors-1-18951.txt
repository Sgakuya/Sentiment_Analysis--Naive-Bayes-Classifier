I think his films are good, but he is wrong to claim they are documentaries which implies a wholly factual basisfor them. I actually find him quite a sad and pitiful man. As fat and homely as he is now, he looks like a stud muffin compared to his high school pictures. He is the fat, lonely, dateless boy who finally has gotten people to notice him and he doesn't always handle the attention well. Don't hate him, pity him.
