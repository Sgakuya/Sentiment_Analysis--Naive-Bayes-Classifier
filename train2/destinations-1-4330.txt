Filthy, disgusting, smelly armpit of a city. People in L.A. are, when not totally rude and obxoxious, intellectually bankrupt. Won't even talk about the traffic. Smog is absolutely stiffling. Can't swing a dead cat without hitting a homeless person. And believe me there are plenty of dead cats to choose from. In a word: hell.
