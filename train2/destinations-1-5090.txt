If you are rude, snobby, stuck on yourself, and not to bright then NY is the state for you. I think it is very over-rated. People need to start seeing it as a state like everyother state because I'll be the first to say it has a lot of attractions, but it's not a bed of roses either. I'm tired of them skanky yankees thinking they are the bomb...because they aren't.
