I have had the pleasure of being in two prductions of Macbeth. Those who consider it a bore, lesser work, or something short of greatness are sadly blind! I have always held the opinion that Hamlet is his greatest character study, Othello, his greatest drama, King Lear his greatest work, and Macbeth his greatest play! For sheer theatricality it surpasses all. You've got magic, murder, madness, and meayhem and about the most interesting relationship that ever existed. The whole thing, to borrow from A.C. Bradley, is "tremendous" in the extreme! Anyone who misses this, again, is not looking with a theatrical eye!!! It boggles in its spectacle of a man willing to destroy for the accomplishment of nothing his very soul. I've committed in my own small way the other tragic heroes' mistakes. At least every time I read or watch Macbeth I can rest assured I have never even come close to that! Shakespeare must have shuttered at least once over what he had written.
