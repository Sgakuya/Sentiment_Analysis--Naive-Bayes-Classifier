I'm giving it a one because of a recent story on the news. The US soccer team was playing in Mexico City when the people in the stadium started chanting Osama Osama. Wow, really intelligent. Too bad we can't build a 20 foot high wall along the border and let this miserable, basically useless country slither back to the 19th century.
