Savannah as some intrinsic charm- Atlanta is too big, over rated and has too much crime and traffic. The rest of this state is typical southern redneck. Too many uneducated misinformed people who are ignorant and bigoted- a small step up from Miss. And Alabama- which is not much of a reason to visit or live here.
