This comic is banal beyond belief. Unfortunately, a capacity for humor does not seem to be part of the psychological makeup of the strip's creator, Bil Keane. To make up for this deficiency, he relies upon the cuteness of its child characters in hopes that it will appeal to the readers. For example, one panel shows little Jeffy with a bleeding knee, saying Mommy, I'm spillin' my leg! ; the readers are supposed to think that's cute. But to me and many others, it's just asinine. I remember a scene in the movie Go , in which one of the film's characters talks about how the Family Circus destroyed the weekend comics because no matter how good the rest of the comics were, it was overshadowed by the Family Circus at the bottom of the page just waiting to suck. That quote encapsulates my feelings completely. In defense of the fans, obviously there are enough of you who still enjoy the dotted-line trails, the creepy ghost grandparents, and the Billy-fills-in-for-dad routines, to keep the strip alive. To each his/her own.
