Call quality is appalling, there are lots of call drops and static. Most times you cannot hear what the person at the other end is saying or they do not hear you. The most annoying is that when you call the customer support service line, they take about 30 to 45 minutes to answer your call. They always blame call volume. Even when they answer, in so many cases you get through to people who are not very knowlegable about the technology they are selling. I have since disconnected my line with Vonage and would seriously advise people not to sign up for this crappy service. Don't do it!
