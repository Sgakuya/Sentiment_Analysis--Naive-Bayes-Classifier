One of my favorites. Stunning looks and fairly talented actress. Fell for her in Starship Troopers and was good in Wild Things and Undercover Brother. Dont really see her doing any serious Drama movies though. She could probably be very successful in a comedic TV sitcom or on Cable. She married and had Charlie Sheen's baby. Lucky dude. That guy has screwed a ton of women in Hollywood. she's got a really flat ass though.
