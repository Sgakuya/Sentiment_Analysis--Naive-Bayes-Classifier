I hope one-day Hollywood wakes up and realizes what a talent this guy is. I think they have to a certain extent because he has had a chance to turn in some really good performances ( Sabrina , As Good as it Gets ). My only question is why don t we see more of him? It s like, now you see him, now you don t. And give him a lead role for heaven s sake. He s better looking than most of the guys who are leading men and acting-wise I know he can handle it. I d certainly buy a ticket!
