Overrated indeed!! I get i kick out of people who rave about this crappy place. What was once a nice city 15 years ago has been turned into a craphole thanks to CA and TX yuppies moving there, please stop coming here, go away!!!! Traffic is bad and people are not friendly, they are phony. That "brown cloud" that hangs over the city is always nice too, reminds me of LA. Downtown sucks with it's chain stores and all the bums and nutjobs hanging out. It seems at every exit off the highway there is a homeless person holding a sign begging for money, deppressing city overall.!
