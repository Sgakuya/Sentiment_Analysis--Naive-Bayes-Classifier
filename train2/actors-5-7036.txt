Hauer is an absolutely wonderful actor as exhibited by his performances in movies such as Blade Runner and Soldier of Orange. Unfortunately his willingness to do any movie that comes his way has lead to him being associated with a lot of really bad movies which in turn has lead people to underrate his acting ability.
