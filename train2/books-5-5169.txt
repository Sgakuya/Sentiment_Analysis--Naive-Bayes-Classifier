John Irving is one of my favorite authors (in fact, I have read all his books), and this novel is his Masterpiece. It tells a wonderful tale of the life of an Orphan, Homer Wells, and how the ether-addicted head of the orphange where he is raised, Dr. Wilber Larch, comes to love him like a son. Homer goes away for the week-end with an apple growing couple who come to the orphanage seeking an abortion (which Dr. Larch preforms on a regular basis, Illegally), and wides up living with them. The story winds through the web of Homer's life, ending up where it all started. Although you may not agree with the politics of the novel, it is a very good story and enjoyable to read. The story is highly detailed (often too detailed). The movie, while highly enjoyable, does not do justice to the book.
