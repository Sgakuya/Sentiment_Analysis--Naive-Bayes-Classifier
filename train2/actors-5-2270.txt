I happen to be a huge Mel Gibson fan and beleive that he has proven himself to be a great actor. He does this by making his characters believable. He was the flirty, goofy, yet reliable cop in the Lethal Weapons. He was the steadfast father who would do anything for his kids in Patriot and Signs. He was the fearless leader in Braveheart(my all-time favorite) and We Were Soldiers. And he was the bad guy who was just charismatic enough to make you love him and overlook the fact that he killed people without blinking an eye in Payback. And I have yet to see anyone else portray pain as well as he does. Seriously, There have been times when I wondered if the director yelled cut thinking they had actually harmed him.
