This is a great book if you appreciate someone creating their own version of the Bible. The book was given as a gift to me. I read up to the third chapter and then the last few pages. It stays pretty close to the Bible yet, to me, it diviates just enough to put a whole new spin on it. Bottom line, if you're not really into reading and studing the Bible, this book is great.
