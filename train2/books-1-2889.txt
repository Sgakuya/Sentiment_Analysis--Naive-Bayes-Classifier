This is a very disturbing misrepresentation of United States history. I am very concerned that young people will read this and nothing else. No country is perfect. No civilization has ever existed without making mistakes. The United States is the most noble experiment in the history of civilization. It was founded by the greatest minds of the era. It was founded by the landed gentry, the aristocricy. People's History by Howard Zinn is propaganda trash.
