i think that Meg Ryan is like the best actress. she is like so cute and she always plays her part so well. i lover her hair! im getting my hair cut like her in feb. :) i think she did a really good job in the movie city of angels , omg! the ending to that movie was good but way to sad! she played that part sooo good. i dont think anyone could have done a better job then her.
