Good book. Seen through the eyes of a little girl they call Scout. It takes place in the south in the depression era. her dad is a lawyer who is defending a black man who has been wrongly accused of raping a white woman. Well written book gives a glimpse of injustice and prejudice. Also turned into a great movie.
