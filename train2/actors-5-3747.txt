This guy has been one of my favorite actors over the past decade or so. He has portrayed so many different types of characters in a bunch of movies over the years. Gangster-pimp wanna be in 'True Romance'. Creepy vampire in 'Dracula'. Even played the devil in one of the last music videos ever made by Guns 'n' Roses. Very versatile in his range, master of accents and dialects. I have seen some bad movies that Gary Oldman has been in, but I have never seen him give a bad performance.
