There's one thing in my life I know for sure and that is that I NEVER want to live in Florida. This simply one of the worst states I have ever been to and unfortunately I've been there way too often. Beaches lined with concrete monstrosities, strip mall after strip mall, and some of the most unsavory looking people I have ever come across. I say we lop it off.
