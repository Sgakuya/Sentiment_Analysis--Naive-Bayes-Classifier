Leo is beautiful because he is different. Unlike most young actors, he's not afraid to mess his pretty face in the roles he plays. He is so diverse and realistic. I've watched every single Leo movie simply because I KNOW every film he will EVER make will be worth seeing. His performances capture me like no other actor's performance could. I especially like how he does what he wants with his life. If he wants to party and get wasted...he should. If he wants to have fun with the ladies...it's his life. I admire his rebellion as well as his immense talent. His awesome body and face don't hurt at all. I hope he continues to make films forever...talent like his shouldn't go to waste.
