Worst warranty in the automobile business. I have a Kia Sedona 2002 with only 37,000 miles on it. It has slung a rod through the oil pan and they WILL NOT warrant it. They said lack of maintence on my part is the reason it happened. I have maintained my van. BUT, lets just say that I hadn't, there is no way that it should have slung a rod after only 37,000 miles....DO NOT BUY ANY KIA vehicles....
