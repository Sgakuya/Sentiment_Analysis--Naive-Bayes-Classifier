I guess I'm more of a purist, I don't think hard alcohol should be pre-mixed with anything. Especially this mix. I have tried almost all of the other Absoluts (except Pepar) and since most seemed pretty decent, I figured Kurant wouldn't be too bad. I was wrong, it tasted like dirt, I wouldn't drink this again if it was free.
