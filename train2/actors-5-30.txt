If there are people foolish enough to think Jimmy Stewart was bland, they have NOT watched enough of his vast array of films...and they know very little of his life. I agree with the person who said that few in Hollywood have been willing to lay it on the line like he did. This man was a TRUE American Hero...and not just a screen hero. He actually served to protect his country...not like a vast majority of the Hollywood wimps out there today.
