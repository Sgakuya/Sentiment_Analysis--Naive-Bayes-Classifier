As a fiftytwo year old woman who prefers the comfortable simplicity of Maryjanes, I find your recent commercial offensive. Am I an immature out-of-touch socially inept woman? I don't think so. Am I concerned with the peer pressure of a co-worker who advises me to grow up? Hardly. I have spent most of my adult life (having been a product of the good-girl 5o's) learning to be my own person and stand up for my own choices. One of thoes choices, minor as it may seem, is to wear Maryjanes, whether others do or not, as this simple little footwear goes in and out of style. Thank you for the opportunity share my feelings re: that irritating commercial.
