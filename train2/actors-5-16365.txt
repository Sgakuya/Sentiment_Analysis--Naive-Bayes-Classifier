David Andrew Mc Donald *****is one of the best actors on daytime...i really appreciate the playfulness Edmund and Cassie portrayed today(Friday 25 june)and would totally enjoy more of the same for the future, lets have more entertainment and less pointless drama.Want them to get back together and have the type of writing i saw today!!!
