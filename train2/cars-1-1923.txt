I own a 1996 Dodge Neon. I do not recommend this vehicle to anyone. I purchased it brand new it only had 45 miles. The head gasket blew on it at 65,000, alot of transmission problems, the heater and ac had a bad smell when turned on, when we went to change the spare tire the trunk had rainwater that had leaked in the trunk in the spare tire holder. Guess you know now why the bad smell with the heater and ac. One of my co-workers owned a 2001 model and hers leaked from the front and messed up all her electrial system. She had a 2003 Neon model for a rental car and it done the same thing as hers, the manufactur brought hers back after she videotaped it leaking in the inside while her husband sprayed the hood with a water hose. Chrysler told her they would buy it back since her driveway was at a 13 degree slant and that is what is causing it to leak when it rained. Believe me as a owner it wasn't her driveway it was very poor manufacturing that she had on videotape.
