This man was awesome. I can only hope that this relatively low rating here can only mean that few voters have ever seen anything he did prior to Star Wars . Don't let poor TV programming selections keep you from experiencing the great Guinness. The list of his work covers around six decades and is too long to go into but you can find it on imdb.com.
