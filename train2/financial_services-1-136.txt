$Rip off artists. Processing checks from highest to lowest to collect additional fees. I had the misfortune of forgetting to deduct a check which caused a snowball effect that ran up to almost $400 in fees. If they had paid the checks from lowest to highest, as most banks do. I would have fared much better. I hate this bank.
