I have just learned that the V6 engine in my 1996 Camry has to be thoroughly overhauled to the tune of $4,000 because the engine is slugged. This translates to the oil system failed and allowed the engine to get all sludgy inside. This car has only 70,000 miles on it and now burns oil worse than a 56 Olds! That's bad valves to me. We bought this thing because of Toyota's rep as one of the most reliable cars on the market. What a crock.
