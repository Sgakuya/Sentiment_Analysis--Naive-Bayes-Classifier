If Los Angeles had snow...it would be a mix between Buffalo, Detroit, and Hartford. The only redeeming part of LA is all the East Coast and Midwesterers that make it livable. The locals seem to suffer from a schizoid reaction from too much sun...not too mention a low appreciation for history. Morally bankrupt.
