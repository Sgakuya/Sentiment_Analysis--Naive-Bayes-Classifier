Beautiful and talented. One of the few artist nominated for both grammy and oscar. She is one of the most versatile artist today. Raps, sings (quite well too), talkshow host, tv star, covergirl spokesperson, big screeen actress, producer, writer. This woman has talent. Thank god she's not the usual blond beanpole Hollywood seems to adore so much.
