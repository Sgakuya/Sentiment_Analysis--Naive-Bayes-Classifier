This is a terrible bank. Their customer service is horrible. For example, when I got married it took 9 months for them to join my husband's and my accounts together properly. Of course, the entire time they were charging us fees that we had to keep track of and yell for them to be refunded. The fees for this bank are extremely high. Especially the brokerage and IRA accounts. Also, their investing advice is based on whatever funds their licensed broker's get commission on. I would not recommend this bank to anyone, not even my worst enemy.
