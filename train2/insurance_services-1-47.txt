This comment is ridiculous! 7.

I like their convenient website, their friendly customer service, and most of all what I like is my very inexpensive insurance! The only reason they're the cheapest right not is because they don't respond or want to pay claims when THEIR own insured is at fault! They even asked me if I recalled the condition of their insureds vehicle when he hit me! Yeah, they suck. Don't be loyal to your insurance company because you have your heads in the clouds! They'll screw you when your not looking. Oh yeah, they offered me $250 to settle. So far, my car has cost me $6200, medical is over $20000 (including a hospital stay), $700 on a loaner, and around $3000 in lost wages...yeah, I got an attorney. Why couldn't they have just done the right thing instead of sending the 17 year old uneducated kid to offer me $250!!???
