Robin Strasser is a marvel, I only wish we saw more of her. She is funny, sexy, and subtle in her portrayal of Dorian (how easy it would be to slip into caricature in this part, but she does not), and isn't she simply gorgeous? I should hate her - I think she's my boyfriend's fantasy - but I've made her my role-model instead.
