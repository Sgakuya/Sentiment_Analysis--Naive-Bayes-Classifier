"The Great Gatsby" is the quintenssential "Great American Novel" - Clearly the best work that Fitzgerald ever did. Nothing seemed out of place and it was told in an easy to read and mostly linear fashion. Nick Carroway is the lead character and most of the story is told through his eyes as he narrates us through the mindset of the rich and greedy inhabitants of a small, well to do, mid-western town. This makes the book even more interesting, because it leaves it open to interperatation as to whether Carroway is telling us the gospel truth, or his own, sometimes skewed, perspective on things . . . . "The Great Gatsby" is also loaded with symbolism - The Green light that Gatsby is fixated on as he stares across the Harbour symbolizes his never ending quest for the emotional satisfaction that always seems to elude him . . . . .No matter how much wealth and status he accumulates . . . . The advertisement of the optomologist with the "all seeing eye" that is present at Wilsons' Gas Station symbolizes the only semblence of judgement and accountability that eludes the self-serving protaganists in the story, it seems . . . . "Carelessness" is also recurring theme in this book, as all of the characters exhibit this particular trait, in one form or another, and that is the crux of the story, I believe. What I got out of "Gatsby" was a reminder of sorts, and a lesson that is more relevent today than even when it was written - That there is a danger in being emotionally attatched to unobtainable things, and that rich and powerful people can wreak havoc when attempting to mold the world around them into their fanciful ideals with little or no regard for the consequences . . . .
