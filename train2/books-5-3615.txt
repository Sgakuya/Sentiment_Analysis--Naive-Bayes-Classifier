I believe Hamlet is one of the most intriguing characters to appear from shakespeare's plays. He shows all the darkest human emotions and displays everything that is habitual and natural of a human being. Although I must say Gertrude is the worst of shakespeare's characters. A very selfish and stupid woman, no wonder hamlet makes such harsh generalisations about women with that silly bitch as a role model. Awful woman.
