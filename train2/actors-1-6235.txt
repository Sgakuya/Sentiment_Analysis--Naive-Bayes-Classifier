He's hardly the only conservative Hollywood star out there, despite that town's liberal image. Look at Willis, Schwarzenegger, Gibson, et al -- they're conservative, but they at least have the good sense not to alienate their public with excessive public stridency. (Same goes for most politically active Hollywood liberals, though there are a few who go too far.) Heston has gone way too far, rubbing his views in the faces of grieving Columbine parents, for example. He has presided over the NRA at its worst. The NRA was once a useful organization, committed to training and safety. They taught me how to shoot when I was 12, and I have the junior sharpshooter's badge to prove it. But lately they've been mired in the worst kind of political advocacy -- belligerent, paranoid, defensive, and anti-community. When two kids blow away a bunch of their classmates (and themselves--so much for stiffer sentences as a remedy for gun violence) with guns they brought to school, the community has a right to be concerned. Heston's response to that concern? He holds a rally a few miles from Columbine High, waves a gun in the air and says, Five words: From My Cold Dead Hands. Such tactics do no service to NRA members, the second amendment, the community, or the nation. Time for Heston to leave the stage.
