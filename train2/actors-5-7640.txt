Benjamin Bratt is a very attractive man and can do some sound acting. I loved him in Miss Congeniality with Sandra Bullock. I was disappointed when he married so quickly after breaking up with Julia Roberts, but his family is lovely and I can't like him less for that. I can't wait 'til his movie with Mark Consuelos comes out. . .two cuties in one flick might just be too much for me. . .
