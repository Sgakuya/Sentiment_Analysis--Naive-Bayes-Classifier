Horrble, horrible, horible!!!! They charge 4o cents a minute. Not to mention if you are a few days late on your bill they cut the service off then charge you $20 to reconnect. I wish I never contracted with them. The only thing stopping me from ending the service is the rideculous $150 early termination fee.
