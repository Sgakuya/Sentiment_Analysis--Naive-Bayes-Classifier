Don't ever waste your time even driving through this state. I've lived here for nine years and this has been the worst experience ever. It really makes you thankful for the state you came from. No matter where you go, the people are inbred toothless morons. These people are greedy, thieving bastards who take great joy in screwing people over. They live for gossip. These people want to know every detail about your life so they can feel like their one step ahead of you, although all of them put together have the IQ of peanut. Everybody hates everybody in Georgia. Whites hate both whites and blacks. Blacks really hate whites as well as other blacks. It's the most messed up situation I've ever seen. If someone would have told me what I'm telling you now before I moved here, there's no way I would have believed them. It's just unreal. When I moved to Georgia, I thought I had died and gone to hell. It's that bad. Stay away from this state and anyone born and raised in this state. I'm so glad to be getting out of this state.
