my favourite part of Stephen King's collection is how many of them run together. The connections between Jack and the territories and Roland and The Dark tower are fascinating. I like (but am angered) how King (and Straub) keep the reader hanging at the end. I love Jack, and it's good to see him as a man. I think this book is a great sequel, and does justice to the Talisman. I think this book could stand on itss own as a separate novel, but it means so much more when you've also read the Talisman
