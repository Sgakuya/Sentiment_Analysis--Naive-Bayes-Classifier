I love Kate in nearly every role she attempts beacuse you see she puts all of herself into them. That's why it seems like she's like the character. That's called good acting. She is beautiful, real, classy and graceful. She dosen't try to be someone other than herself and she doesn't try to separate herself or cash in on her mother's success. I think this charming actress has a long, promising career ahead of her.
