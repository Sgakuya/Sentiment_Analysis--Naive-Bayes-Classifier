A great read. Nice and easy pace. It gets into the details of a particular vetainary treatment without boggin down with highly technical discriptions. The various farmers and pet owners are highly interesting and it really brings them to life. Herriot has a way of making everything interesting. I highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone.
