He's an excellent actor and he's really cute. I don't know the details of this Abu- Jamal business, but if he and all those other excellent artists support him, I bet I agree, because that seems to be the left wing point of view. I think it's sick to boycott his products because all of his profits go to charity. Besides all the politics and his great acting ability (Great in Nobody's Fool ), he makes GREAT popcorn!
