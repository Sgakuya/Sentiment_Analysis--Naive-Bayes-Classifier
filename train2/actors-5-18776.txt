I used to have a deep desire to understand interesting underground filmmakers and be knowledgable about all that crap. No more. But the one great find I made in all those pursuits were the films of Jim Jarmusch, most notably Dead Man Stranger than Paradise and Mystery Train (and also Down by Law Night on Earth and a more recent one I haven't tracked down yet). Jarmusch films are shot so incredibly well that you look at each frame like a painting. You'll have to go into them expecting something different from Lethal Weapon or whatnot, but its really one of those rare treats where you say THAT was unique. I suppose that over the years, these films have gotten a little less unique. Early Jarmusch films (e.g., Mystery Train) tended to have several plots running concurrently, only intersecting at the end. That trick has been picked up on a lot in the last few years, but never with same wry sense of humor that Jarmusch brings to the screen. A reoccuring theme in his films concerns the element of chance, vs. the designs of destiny, which is always a fun one. Anyway, see Jim Jarmusch's films. That's the main thing you need to know.
