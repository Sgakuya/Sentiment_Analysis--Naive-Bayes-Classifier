Once upon a time Canadian was a fine, clean tasting beer that embodied what Canadian beer making was all about. then a few years ago, some spritzer sipping pencil neck decided to slash the brewing budget and spend the money pumping out a series of highly annoying and ineffective ads about what Canadians are. I had a Molson in London, England once and it was the best tasting Canadian beer I'd ever had. Brewed by license in England. If it weren't for Alexander Keith's (pronounced Keet's my brother Americans) Canada's recent beer reputation would be badly tarnished. Just because Canadian beer has more alcohol than American beer does not make it better. I'd take a Sam Adams or a Rolling Rock over a Molson Canadian in a heart beat.
