i think he is absolutely dreamy and a terrific actor! he has the cutest sounding voice and facial expressions. i love his pretty blue eyes! they are terrific! i love how he is 25 and looks like he is 16! i think that really adds to his appeal and not every actor can look that young. the only movie i was not that crazy about was ride with the devil but it was not his fault in any way. he tried his best to save it but the plot was hard to follow and jewel should stick to singing! i saw a thing about him on the internet that he played in empire records. i have seen the movie and i didn't notice him in it. can anyone tell me what part he played. was it a very small part? i would really appreciate it!!!! thanks. blair
