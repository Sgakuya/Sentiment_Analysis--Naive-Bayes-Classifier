James Cameron is a very, very talented director and screenwriter. As much as I disliked the plot of Titanic , the special effects and directing were fantastic. Let's not forget about True Lies , The Terminator , T2 , Aliens , and The Abyss . I think I'm on safe ground in saying that Cameron is one of the most talented directors of our time.
