I rented a 2002 for a 500 mile trip, loaded down with a dog, luggage and baby. The Blazer is a piece of total junk! Handling is off, the ride is hard, the interior noise is so loud that you can't talk to the person in the back seat, and for all the hype, it fits no more than a Volvo stationwagon. I'd walk before ever buying one of these things.
