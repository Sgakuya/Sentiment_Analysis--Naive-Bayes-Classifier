I think she's a very pretty, talented little actress. The first film I saw her in was 'Leon' and her performance was fantastic. She played the part of Mathilda who loses her family and wants to take revenge for the murder of her little brother. She worked very well with the older characters and built up a really good rapport with Jean Reno who plays Leon. She was also very impressive in Heat with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. I thought she did really well with the Star Wars film as well, really looking forward to 'Attack of the Clones', its supposed to be miles better than the first.
