THE ONLY REASON FOR ME TO VIST TURKEY IS TO SEE THE HOUSES AND THE MONUMENTS OF OUR FATHERS.HAGIA SOFIA ,KAPPADOKIA,EFESOS,KONSTANTINOPOLE,SMYRNE ARE PLACES WERE GREEKS DONE FROM ZERO.TURKEYS DONT HAVE EVEN ONE TABEL IN THESE PLACES SO THAT VISITORS CAN KNOW ABOUT THESE.TURKEYS ARE VERY RUDE AND WITH BARBARIANS WAYS.THEY HAVE A GOVERMENT THAT IS CONTROLLED FROM ARMY.THEIR HISTORY IS FULL OF MILLIONS KILLINGS OF ARMENIANS AND GREEKS.I WOULD BE AFRAID TO GO OVER THERE
