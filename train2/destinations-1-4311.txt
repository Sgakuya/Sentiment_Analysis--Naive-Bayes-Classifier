An extreme dissapointment. I thought it was getting a little annoying seeing every show and movie now taking place in New York . But after seeing this place for what it really is, anD not what televison and movies ( some tv and movies, others show it for what it really is) i am not surprised. This place was a fad that hit its peek in the 70's (in the 70's, what does that tell you) and has been and will continue to go down hill ever since. When the big one hits, i hope the 20 or 30 decent people in LA get out in time. America has much better cities to offer, like most of the East Coast cities and Chicago.
