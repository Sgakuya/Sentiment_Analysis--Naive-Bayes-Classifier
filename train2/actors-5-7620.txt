The first time I saw David Arquette on the big screen was in the SCREAM trilogy franchise, and he was wonderful as Dewey. I was so impressed with his goofy personality that I went out and rented another movie that he starred in, it was titled JOHNS. It was an independant film about gay prostitutes...and David Arquette did an amazing job in that role as well ! David Arquette has not been given enough chances to prove himself to the mainstream audience yet, but it didn't take alot of movies for me to realize his true talent. A superb actor who is most certainly in my top 10 favorite actor list. His looks, his acting, his attitude, and his personality are what we need on the big screen. I will watch every movie he comes out with now.
