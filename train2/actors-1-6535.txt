He really is a poor actor. He looks pretty but "reads" his way through the script, then hopes a cute smile will make-up for his generally "blah" performances. Even Officer & Gentleman, probably his best try, comes-up short, especially when you consider the other actors (on this list) who would have done better. Richard Gere is generally just a casting error!
