I was promised service that was equal to the plan I had with AT&T which included 500 anytime minutes/unlimited nights and weekends/unlimited mobile to mobile. When I got my contract, the mobile to mobile was not on it. They told me they would upgrade me to the plan I originally selected and send a new contract. They didn't and my 14-day time to cancel had passed. I called monthly upon receipt of my bill to inquire about the mobile to mobile service. I was told that it was not available yet but they would charge me for it and give me a credit for 6 months then change me to a plan that did offer the service. When I bought the service, I was viewing the available plans on my computer! The 6 month period was up and my bill increased another $10 for mobile to mobile. I called to inquire as to why this was happening and was told that they had been more than generous with me and that I would have to pay extra for the service because my phone did not have the capability of free mobile to mobile (Not the plan this time, it was the phone!) As I have a family member with the plan I intended to have, I brought this to their attention and the fact that she has the same phone as me! They stated that she was being mis-billed. I viewed her contract. Same services I was to have at a lesser rate. I contacted them again and was told that I could purchase new phones for more than $100 each, change to a more expensive plan, and extend my contract. My other options included terminating the contract for $300 or continuing for the next 17 months with the same plan. The customer service rep told me to shut up while she was talking. She cut me off in mid-sentence during my initial explanation of my problem by telling me to Shut up while I tell you how it is! I am the #1 fan of the Cingular Sucks Club!
