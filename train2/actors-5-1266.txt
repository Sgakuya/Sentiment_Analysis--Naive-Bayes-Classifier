100 of roles and characters and movies would have been really silly .. but because of that gentelman it made sence and even touched us ... once he is so damn straight tough guy you almost get scared to look into his eyes ! and once he is so funny like you wish that the movie never ends .. born with a talent is a perfect description for Robert DeNiro
