This has got to be the most segregated place on earth. More rundown areas than any city I've ever set foot in. The locals that are giving this place 5 stars is fine, but to an outsider coming in for a visit, it is a total shock. I see there are some very nice areas, but don't you see there are just too many rundowns to count? I wish Detroit the best.
