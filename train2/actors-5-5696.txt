As a young actor, he's the best out there. One of the few actors I'd go see any movie he is in (the other is Tom Hanks). Right now I see Tobey as kind of a combination of Tom Hanks' everyman and Tom Cruise sex appeal. But Tobey is unique and can't really be compaired to anyone. As a human being, I haven't got a clue... and really don't care.
