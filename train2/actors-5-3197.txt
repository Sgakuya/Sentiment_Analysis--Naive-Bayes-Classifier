I have never seen or watched an actor of such incomparable calibre. His talents are enormous. He portrays each role he's given with such realism, depth and honesty that one cannot help but be in awe. The fact that I can picture Russell Crowe portraying and doing an even better job with numerous roles that have been popularized by other actors, is indicative of his unlimited capacity as an actor. He is in a class of his own....magnificent!!!
