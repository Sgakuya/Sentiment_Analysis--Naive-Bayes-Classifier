Why don't they (and all game console makers) somehow make WIRELESS game consoles so one doesn't have to hook them up to one's TV; it's too much of a hassle, difficult to figure out, and gets in the way. Also they do not make enough of a variety of games. There are people out there, like me, who are klutzoids and get killed right away when they try to play these games. Why not have a whole series of EASY, baby games for people who are not very coordinated. The prices for these games are way too steep besides.
