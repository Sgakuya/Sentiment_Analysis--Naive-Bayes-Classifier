Here's one of those times I wish this Web site used a 10 point scale, because I'd give Barry Levinson a 9. He's better than good, but it's probably not fair to put him on the same level with guys like Hitchcock and Spielberg. Still, I'm giving him five stars, because Diner is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I loved The Natural. Then you have great movies like Bugsy, Rain Man, and the under-rated Wag the Dog. With that list of films under your belt, you deserve five stars.
