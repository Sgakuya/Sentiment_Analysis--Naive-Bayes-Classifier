Ah, let me count the reasons that I can't stand this man.......he thinks he's smart enough to give a political opnion that anyone gives a crap about. First, though, he actually believes anyone listens to his dribble. He's been a President-Wanna Be for ages. (Check out how many times he's played a U.S. President in his films). And to top it all off, he's now starring in a series as the President. YUCK! This old fart is washed up and needs to retire.
