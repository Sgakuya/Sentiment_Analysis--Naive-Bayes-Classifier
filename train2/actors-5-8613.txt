Not sure why other people here have been so harsh with Dietrich, but it seems they have more of a problem with her sexuality than her acting. Marlene, to me, was an exquisite woman. Beautiful beyond words, entrancing to see onscreen, a true movie star. The infamous scene in Morocco where she wears a tux and kisses a woman must be the most erotic scene in motion picture history.
