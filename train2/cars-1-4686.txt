Underpowered with a flimsy body that rusts when you look at it cross-eyed. I find most Toyota drivers to be wimpy looking spindly boys with baseball caps, earrings, goatees and Vermont license plates (So one could infer many things from that.) who have little too much attitude while driving and are generally discourteous snits.
