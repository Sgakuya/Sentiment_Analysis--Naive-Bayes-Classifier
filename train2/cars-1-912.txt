I have ridden only Sea Doo for eight years. The last Sea Doo, A GTX, a good-looking jet ski, fast enough (61 mph) but don't let these two factors cloud the big picture. I had to take it in for a problem after 3 days and again after fifteen. This went on like this for a year. The worst part of all of this was the shop would look at me like it was my fault. Because I rode only Sea Doo's I didn't know any better. I thought this was just the way jet skis are. This GTX was in the shop for exactly 65% of the time I own the Jet Ski. After only 350 hours it was declared a total loose by my insurance company. It was my insurance company, not the Sea Doo Warranty that paid for the lose. I now ride a Honda F12. I am at 90 hours. I ride hard so I change the oil more than the manual says. The Honda, F12 has never been in the shop for a problem. I have not had one problem with the Honda F12, not one. As everyone keeps saying to me, its a Honda, what did you expect. Honda has figured out how to build a dependable motor. I am just one more rider telling you Sea Doo's will last about 300 hours. Its true, do the research on the Internet and the 300-hour life expectancy number for Sea Doo jet skis just keeps popping up. Bombardia will understand only one thing, money. We deserve better than this. As a worldwide Jet Ski riding community we can force Bombardia to do the right thing. Either build a better jet ski or get out of the business. With this philosophy we all win.
