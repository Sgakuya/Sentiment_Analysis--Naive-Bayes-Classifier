Stop it already! What with the terrrrrible obligatory horsey laugh. Must we hear it in every single film? Must we????? She's a cute lady and all but she is so obviously enamored of herself. It's really just too much to handle. It really really is. She's not a good actress really. More like a person who simply plays herself over and over again. Don't forget the faux shocked/surprised horsey laugh. Now that I mention it - you will notice it in every film.
