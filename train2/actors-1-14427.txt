Ugh....I hate that I have to find out who this chick is. She's made a couple nice movies ( I guess) but is more known for her family problems and party girl image. She's not that great and it all seems like a big huff about someone who just isnt that big a star yet. Dated that big time wuss Wilmer Valderramma. If you saw him get Punk'd when his car got wrecked, you know he's a major wuss and she drops a star to terrible and below.
