I had PBW for no more than a month. I made several calls,to customer service, about the problems I was having with my new cell phone. Why I switched from Verizon, I don't know. I guess the guy gave a good sales pitch. When I purchased the service, the place of purchase was only 3-5 miles from my home. I had explained why I use a cell phone and needed two, one for my son to keep tabs at home and one for me for emergency contact with the schools and such. I couldn't get a signal in my own home. I was told that it isn't guaranteed in residential areas, by customer service, that I should check my sales agreement. There was nothing about residential. Everything that the sales man told me that wasn't in the agreement was just a sales pitch to benefit himself and the company. I feel I was set up to fail. The phones did me no good when I needed to get through mobile to mobile. Of course it charged for reaching the answering service part of it but it wouldn't ring the phone in the same room. The company is there to take your money. I am sure if this continues from customer to customer they are only in business until there are no more customers to rip off. The company will surely get rich off their dishonesty. I agree with all the negative postings that I read before I posted this one. It is all true. My one star rating is an over rate.
