I can't even both debating with you right wing conservative, close minded dumb a sses. GET OVER IT. Jane Fonda did nothing but support troops...that is why she did not want to be in Vietnam, she knew we would not win, and didn't want them sent there to just be killed. JANE DID NOT SEND OUT MEN TO WAR...THE GOVERNMENT DID. So stop using Jane Fonda as yor scapegoat and get the Fcuk over it, b/c it's wicked sad and pathetic that you still think it' cool and funny to say Hanoi Jane it just makes you look like an even bigger loser than you already are.
