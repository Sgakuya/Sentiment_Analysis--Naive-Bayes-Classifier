Jada is a smart girl. She got Will wrapped around her finger inorder to enjoy an opulent lifestyle. What has me vexed is that Jada is trying to do a J.Lo. O.K. she had to undergo weight training for the Matrix, but did she have to wear an itty-bitty bikini and do a back shot in their new video? Jada never did a back shot before cause she never had back. Back shots are only used as a ploy. Being from B-more you hear things from former classmates and associates who went to Northern High School with her and Tupac. I wish some of her old friends would think about it and write a book using their old diaries and pictures.
