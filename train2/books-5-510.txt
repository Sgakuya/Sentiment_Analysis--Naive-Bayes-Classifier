by far, my favourite HP book. I read it (a chapter a day) to the children i used to watch after school and for those 15 or twenty minutes there was absolute silence. Rowling's characters and plots are excellent. I think that these books teach children about friendship and family and good. Plus, any book that inspires children to read is worth five starts!
