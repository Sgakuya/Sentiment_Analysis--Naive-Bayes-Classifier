US Cellular has very poor customer service. Right, now I'm trying to terminate my contract. They have tried to bill me for calls that were wrong. One monthe I had over a 2,000 dollar phone bill and they were trying to make me pay for it. Took me over 2 months to get someone to fix it. Left message with several different supervisors and no one ever called back. They are terrible. I wish I would of listened to my friend!!!
