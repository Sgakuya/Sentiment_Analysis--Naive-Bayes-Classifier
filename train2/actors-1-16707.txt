Back when Steve's character was paired with Robin, I was fascinated. Hard to believe, but he actually emoted, people. Now, it's like there's a magical talking wooden log featured front and center every damn day on GH that goes by the name of Jason. Self-righteous bastard. Completely expendable. So, please, PTB. Dispense of him!
