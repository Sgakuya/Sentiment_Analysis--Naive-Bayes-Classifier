No end. They cheat by writing down that you extended contract, when you didn't, and then you cannot get these criminals to fix the records. 3-5 times I have called, they first said we are still under contract, then looked at the notes of all their errors and agreed we are not under contract. All these times they promised to send written confirmation and have supervisor call, but nothing ever happened. These people are fraudulent. see www.isr.umd.edu/gwrubloff/consumer_reports/Verizon_Wireless.htm
