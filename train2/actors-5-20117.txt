Gillian Anderson is the most dramatic actress I have ever seen. She is beautiful, smart, talented and has made the Xfiles the show that it is today. Everything I have ever seen her in she has always outdone herself. I have not seen the House of Mirth but the reviews have been outstanding. Besides being a terrific actress she seems to be one of the few stars that actually go out of her way to make her fans happy. I have seen her at fund raisers and she is one of the only stars that will go into the crowd and meet her fans. To see her in person is such a rush. She readiates. I could go on but will stop.
