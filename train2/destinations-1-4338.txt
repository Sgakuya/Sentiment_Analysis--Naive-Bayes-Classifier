Los Angeles is the worst city I've been to. The locals love to rip you off, cheat you..etc. Traffic is horrible (esp. the 405 freeway) and people seem to like to drive into other people's car (and walk near other people to piss them off). The theme of LA is what's on the outside counts more than what's on the inside. Basically, LA is a materialistic city. It's also a cutt-throat place like somebody already mentioned. I wouldn't recommend people to live here. There's already TONS of people living here, and the lines at theaters, emergency rooms, DMV is LONG!
