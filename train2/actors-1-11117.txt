Can't find anything to like about her, at the recent Golden Globes, what was she dressed as? Was it Halloween and she came as a curly haired 12 year old in an ice skaters dress? I find her dull on talk shows, like she has an IQ of about 50, she can't talk but gushes like a teen-ager, makes me wonder...
