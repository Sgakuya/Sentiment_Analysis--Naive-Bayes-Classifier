Not nearly as bad as St. Louis, but that isn't saying much ! The people that we encountered in KC were really rude, and I mean we didn't meet one nice person ! That does not mean there are no nice individuals in the city, but we never met any while there. The whole city needs an uplift as the place is nothing but a big ole mess. I hope I never have to visit this cesspool again...
