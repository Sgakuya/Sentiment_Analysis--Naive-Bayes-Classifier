Whem an actor becomes larger than life, we begin to forget that he is being picked to bring his persona to a part, not to adapt himself to the part. John Wayne could act and received recognition for his accomplishments, but it is JOHN WAYNE, American Hero, we remember. Either as a marine, a cowboy, a white hunter, or a boxer, he brought the part to life. And, we bought tickets to see him. That's what actors do.
