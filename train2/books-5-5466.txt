This is a trully marvellous book - possibly surpassing 'The Da Vinci Code' as another reviewer has already said. The Illuminati sect is facinating as is the principal villain in this, the Hassassin, an altogether more interesting 'bad guy' than Sillas in 'The Da Vinci Code'. This book has a slightly different style to its more famous counterpart with all the major plot twists packed into the last hundred or so pages, rather than continuously dispersed throughout. However the twists in this book are more intricately layered than in Da Vinci and just when you think you've guessed who did what suddenly everything you guessed is thrown into turmoil with another massive revelation. An amazing literary feat!
