Sick catholic portrayal of Christ as a sissy mommas boy. How anyone who claims to know the Bible can even compare this with the actual event is beyond me. We are to make no idol or image to be a likeness for God. It is one of the Commandments. This movie was nothing more than a Roman Catholics worship of Mary, who is hardly mentioned at all in the New Testament and had nothing to do with the earthly ministry of Christ. We are told over and over not to accept any other Jesus other than the one portrayed in the Word of God. People don't know the real Jesus so they will listen to any doctrine that blows in.
