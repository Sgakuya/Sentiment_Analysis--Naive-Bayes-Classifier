The movie did not do this King thriller justice. The TV version was more accurate than the film. Don't get me wrong, I loved Jack Nicholson and what's her name? the Olive Oil chick..however that version missed so many subplots that were so important to the overall story. The Shining was one of those books that I didn't even want to keep in my room at night (once I managed to put it down that is!) I was afraid it would come to life or something.
