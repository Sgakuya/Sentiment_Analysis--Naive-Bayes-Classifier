All I can say is.....who is the idiot who thought Brandy is a Diva? She doesn't even come close to that title nor will she ever with that attitude and weak and breathy voice of hers. And her acting.....ugh! Need I say more?! I thought her TV acting was bad, than I Still Know came out. That just blew her over the top for the worst big screen actress is years. Brandy stay home with your mom and dad you stuck up snob.
