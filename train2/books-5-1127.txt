If you're looking for something to read whilst waiting for the next Harry Potter--this is it! And those Harry-haters out there might love it, too. Artemis is no Harry, in fact, he's a world-class criminal genius. Read about how he gets tangled up with the fairy realm and who comes out on top and be very amused along the way. The sequel is also quite good (a little slow starting, but stay with it!), but this is champion.
