Those who enjoy wild romance will not be disappointed. This is a story of anger and passion, of the damage and fury unleashed by a man of gypsy blood who finds his love for a woman thwarted by circumstance and the prevailing values of society. The reader can identify with Heathcliffe's rage while at the same time understanding its destructive nature.
