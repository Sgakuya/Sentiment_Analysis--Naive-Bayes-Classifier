I received the WORST customer service from these people!! I had service for 4 days w/DirecTV when I was informed by my landlord that I could not keep the dish. I called customer service and they said that there was nothing that they could do to help me because I had already signed a 1 year contract and they could not waive the $150.00 cancellation fee under no circumstances, and also that there was no grace period for cancellation without fee. Now, I have worked in the telecomm customer service industry for the past 3 years and I have never heard of a company that will not give a grace period. This is utterly ridiculous....so then the rep tells me that he can prorate my $150.00 fee for one month and this will take off a whopping $15.50!!! WOW did I feel special then!! So the next bill I get doesn't have the cancellation fee, so I am happy that maybe they were actually decent enough to waive the fee. The bill shows a balance of -$67.21 so I don't have to pay it right? Well I get the next months bill (on 5/15/03) and the cancellation fee has kicked in and now I have a balance of around 70 bucks or so....due on 5/28/03..... well I receive a notice of collection from them saying that I have not paid my bill in two months and that if I do not pay in full by 5/23/03 (yes even though the due date on the bill was 5/28/03 and the month before I had a 60 buck credit!!!!) then they would be forced to turn me over to a collection agency...... beware of this company.... satellite tv can be purchased elsewhere!!!!!
