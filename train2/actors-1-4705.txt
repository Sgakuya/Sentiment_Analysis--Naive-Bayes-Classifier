I will say he can act decent enough, but I will also say that he has horrible taste in movies that he performs in, and I also think he is possibly one of the trashiest actors alive. YUCK ! I am always angry when I find out that a good script is ruined because they cast this guy in it. I try my hardest to stay away from any movie he stars in.
