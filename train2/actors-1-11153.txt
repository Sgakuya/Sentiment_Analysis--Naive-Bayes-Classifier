I think she stinks. She is not even natural in interviews. She is always tossing her hair around and trying to look cute when she really looks like a dumbed down version of an ice princess. Sorry to those of you who love her. To each his own. Personally, I'd rather see Tom put on a dress and play Kidman s roles than have to sit through a movie with her in it.
