He can't even play dead, he's such a horrible actor! I could have played Jack Dawson better than he did! And if I hear one more word about what a hottie (Leo is ugly as hell) he is, I WILL puke on someone's shoes. And as the twins in Man in the Iron Mask, he didn't do terribly as the good twin, but he was so awful as the bad twin that I cracked up and did not stop laughing until the credits were over...I had tears running down my face, for God's sake! Yes, Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the worst actors in history, and I'll see to it that he drops on this list! Take care, everyone.
