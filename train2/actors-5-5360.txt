Dennis you're amazing. Dragonheart I have to admit is one of my favorite films. You are handsome, witty, and you just get sexier with age. Meg Ryan - forget her - she got her comeuppance when that idiot Russell Crowe dumped her. He's a jerk but you're a real man and a real actor. Your son and my son almost share a birthday and ya know they weighed the same at birth? Now how cool is that??? I say it's Karma! You rock Dennis Quaid, or shall I call you Bowen??? You can slay my dragon anytime...
