THE WORST! Don't believe any low rate baloney. Long distance is not cheap! If you are 2 weeks late, your service gets cut off with no warning and will not get restored for about 3 days!!!!!! Only recommend this place to your worst enemy. My service was cut off during a hurricane for being 2 wekks late and I could not even call my family. My bill was always about 100.00 never 49.95.
