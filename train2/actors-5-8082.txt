A magnificent actress who could do anything from period drama to light romantic comedy and better than most. One of the funniest lines I ever heard this woman deliver (as only she could) was in a film called Desk Set . Spencer Tracy had just said, I ve been thinking to which she swiftly remarks WAS it exciting for you! Nobody could zing someone like Kate Hepburn and I have never seen her put in a bad performance regardless of material, acting partners, or age. She s one of the true, undeniable greats.
