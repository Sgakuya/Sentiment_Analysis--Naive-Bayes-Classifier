I've just had a very bad experience with Telus customer service. The person I was dealing with definitely should pick a new career. He kept passing the buck to authorized retailers and the manufacturer of the phone I had purchased from Telus. Instead of trying to help me he sent me 3-rd party phone numbers to call. I can't believe they get away with stuff like that...
