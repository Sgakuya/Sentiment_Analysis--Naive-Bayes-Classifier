Trying to get through to customer service with a question or problem is fruitless. I called them during normal working hours and immediately got a machine saying they'd call me back but if I need immediate assistance press 1 for customer service. I pressed 1 for customer service and got the same recording to leave a message and they'd get back to me. What ever happened to talking to a real person. By the way, I'm still waiting for someone real to call me back.
