Higher cancellation fee, miss up with the account, always charge customers more. One terrible experiement: if you activate over the web, they do not tell you what plan you have chose, on you first month bill, they just put you on the most expensive way to charge you!! i.e., if you call more in evening and weekend, they switch you to no free evening and weekend plan, then you get a huge bill!!
