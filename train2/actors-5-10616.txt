I find Drew to be a very compelling figure and I am a big fan. She had gone through more by the time she was 15 than most people go through in a lifetime. No one gave her a chance to make it back, let alone to be at the top of her profession. And that's exactly where she now is. I'm not really sure if I think that she is all that great of an actress (I thought she was decent in Charlie's Angels and sort of endearing in Wedding Singer), but it must be pretty cool to have proven everyone so wrong.
