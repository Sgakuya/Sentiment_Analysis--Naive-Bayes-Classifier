I never really paid much attention to Eric. I liked him in Black Hawk Down even though his character was a bit on the crazy side, and I thought he made an okay Hulk. But when I saw him in Troy I was blown away. He made for a gorgeous, intriguing Hector and I found myself cheering him on instead of Achilles. His eyes were so expressive that it made his acting that much more believable. When I saw him on Jay Leno, he was funny and charming, and he's obviously a doting husband and father. All in all, a great man, both on and off the screen.
