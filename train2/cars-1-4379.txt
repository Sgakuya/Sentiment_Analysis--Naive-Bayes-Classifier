We have had our van serviced 4 times with major engine issues (headgasket, carb, etc.). Each issue has been covered under our extended warranty. However, I'm afraid to keep it much longer. I have another 20k before the warranty expires and plan on trading it prior to the expiration of it's warranty. This working mother has been stranded to many times with and without children along the side of the road.
