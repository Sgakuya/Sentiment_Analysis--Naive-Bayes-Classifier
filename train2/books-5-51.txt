This is a real heartbreaking book. I read all three of Dave Pelzer's books. After reading of the horrific abuse suffered at his mother's hands, it is amazing that he turned into such a wonderful successful man. It was sickening to me this boy went through and for years before anything was done about it. It is a hard to put down book especially knowing that this really did happen to Dave. A good book, but very upsetting to read.
