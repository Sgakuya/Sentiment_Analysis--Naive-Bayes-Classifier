Her win for a 2005 Emmy shows clearly that the Emmys have once again become a joke. As said below, blinking and staring do not convey emotion. Truly shocking that she won an Emmy, given her lack of talent, but her win is confirmation that the Emmys are, after a few of good years, once again a laughing stock. She has such a limited emotional range but she is clearly a GH pet.
