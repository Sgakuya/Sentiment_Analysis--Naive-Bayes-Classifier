SunTrust Bank has the worst automated telephone service in the country!! My balance is neveer correct unless I haven't had any activity in my account for about 5 or 6 days. I can't count the number of times this has made me get charged with an unavailable funds fee. Also, their customer service is terrible! They are not very customer oriented. I'll say this, after reading all information that I recieved when I opened an account at SunTrust, I'm still finding out new things today. It's Time to switch banks, huh?
