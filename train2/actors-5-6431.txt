I can't remember when i was first bitten by the Joshua bug, but I have been watching him for awhile now. I think he has improved a lot through the years. Yes he tends to pick roles that are under his potential but that is the market these days...As he contiues to grow as an actor i am sure more serious roles will come his way. I am also amazed at the stories i hear about how nice he is in person. I haven't read a single story that speaks badly of him. And for the interviews i have read and seen with him i can tell he is a very intelligent young man. It's great to see such a fun loving smart and talented actor in today's generation. Much Luck to You Joshua!
