Mr Fiennes is one of the best actors of our time. His intensity, range of emotion/character and his dedication to excellence makes him a first-rate performer. The English Patient is my favorite film of all time. I have yet to see Mr Fiennes in a bad film. He picks only the best and then applies 100% of his craft to ensure the movie is memorable. A real keeper! Love those eyes, too!
