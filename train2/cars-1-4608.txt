Except for the 2001 these things are just plain stone ugly (ok maybe just homely for all you Nissan fans). Why don't they put a longer W.B. on the extended and 4 door models? It looks like the old time FX drag cars with rear tires by the back of the front seat. I wonder if they come with wheely bars? I'm gettin old and I like my rear tires closer to the back of my vehicle for a better ride. Didn't they use to call these things DATSUN's???
