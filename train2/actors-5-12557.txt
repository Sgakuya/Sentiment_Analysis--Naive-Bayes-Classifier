As far as potential goes, this girl by far definitely has A LOT of potential to go all the way to the top in due time. She seems very grounded as well which is a relief and refreshing. I've never once heard Julia complain about acting and what the job entails and she's definitely NOT one of those in your face teenie bop actresses who do nothing but annoy me and complain about their hard life in Hollywood movies O'h boo hoo, why not try a 9-5 job then. I think in Ten Things I Hate About You she definitely portrayed that part well with all honesty as well as Saved the Last Dance . I wish her all the best for the future.
