Lojack, again it was the British empire and not the english empire. Has its share of castles and things to see and do, but you do have to put up with some of the people. The further south you go the ruder they get. Also part of the United Kingdom but they seem to get way more attention then Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.
