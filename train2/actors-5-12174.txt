I can't believe some of the crap jealous females will say. Anorexic? Whatever! She's naturally beautiful on the exterior. And the way she seems to pick her roles to maintain an honorable self image. I admire her conviction and maturity for being 22. She's everything I've been looking for in a woman. Alas, I am not a celebrity with an agent to arrange a meeting. Someone on this page says she doesn't answer her fan mail? Maybe she only answers the ones with substance. Manny J.
