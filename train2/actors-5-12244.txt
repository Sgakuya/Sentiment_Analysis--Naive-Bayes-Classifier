I have comments for several people who commented on Halle Berry being unattractive, a bad actress, boring, and last but not least, the most ignorant comment of all, that she looks like a rat. The women is undoubtedly beautiful because if she wasn't, the entire world wouldn't keep saying so. Anyone who thinks there are others who are more or equally attractive may be correct but to say she is ugly which is an unkind and hateful word (almost always used by those who are jealous, have self hate or are blatantly unnattractive themselves) is absolutely false and just plain ridiculous. The woman is a pheonomenal actor and though she has obvious issues with men, identity and self esteem to some degree since she ends up with one abuser after another, her talent is unquestionable. Does she make bad choices in men? Perhaps. Is it sad that she had to have sex with a white man in a movie to get an Oscar? (as quoted by Jada Kiss) Absolutely! But to call a woman who can't help being adored and borderline worshipped vain, frigid and conceited, means that some of you out there have some serious issues within yourselves and perhaps need to visit a professional to work on your own self confidence so you can stop tearing super stars down to make yourselves feel better. How cliche and pathetic! Yay for Halle!
