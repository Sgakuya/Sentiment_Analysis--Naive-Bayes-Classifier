It's a shame that Maureen Garrett is no longer on contract with GL because she was easily the most talented actress on the show, which is no small feat considering the high calibre of talent that has passed through the show. She came in as a recast over 25 years ago, and even though I love Michael Zaslow more than words can describe and still think of him as the most talented and legendary actor in all of daytime, Maureen Garrett was the one who made Roger and Holly really WORK. Before Garrett, Roger and Holly were lukewarm and you could either take them or leave them. But then Maureen came in as Holly and turned the character into a fan favorite and helped make Roger and Holly one of the most beloved soap couples of all time. It's a crying shame that Maureen never got an Emmy, and its even sadder that she's no longer an official member of the GL cast.
