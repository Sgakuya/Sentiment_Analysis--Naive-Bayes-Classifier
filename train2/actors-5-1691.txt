Top-notch actor, good looking, dignified persona. I ve enjoyed Denzel s performances since way back when he was one of the young docs on St. Elsewhere and in many films since that time. So, it doesn t surprise me at all that he won an Oscar the other night. What does amaze me in the year 2002 is that race is still part of the consideration (whether a triumph or tragedy) when it comes to an award ceremony. Makes me long to be at a place in time where we can just say, Excellent actor, great performance, bravo! Maybe one day.
