Julia wouldn't know talent if it walked in wearing a big red hat and slapped her in the face. She is an embarassment to all women. Last I checked, according to our constitution, George W. Bush is OUR president, as Bill Clinton was... by virtue of the fact she claims Bush is not her President and never will be , she has tacitly stated she is NOT an American (well, there's a surprise). Why doesn't she just leave and take Alec, Barbara, and all the rest of those idiots with her?
