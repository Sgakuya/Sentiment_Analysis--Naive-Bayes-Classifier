This book is not helpful, don't buy it. How can someone write a book like that? Everyones different experiences different things. I don't get it, that one book won't help everyone who buys its. Bad stuff happens all the time, and after years of stressing and comaplaining, ya right, like as if a book will magically solve everything. Boo!
