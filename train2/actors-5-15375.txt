Here's to a very fine actress in several Disney films, in the 50s Mickey Mouse Club, in the 60s Beach movies with Frankie, the Skippy commercials. She did a wonderful contribution to all of them. Even though I wasn't born until 1969, I think Annette is a very good entertainer and was very pretty in her heydays. My hats off to her for her brave fight from Multiple Sclerosis. I wish you well, Annette.
