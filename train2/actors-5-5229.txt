My local paper Naples Daily News printed on 5/12/01 that Robert Redford rebuffed opportunity to join with Gale Norton, Secretary of Interior, to appear with her to set free a condor into the wild publicly. Redford told her the Bush administration has an abysmal record of keeping promises made on envirormental issues. He said You have sold out to Big Businesses at the expense of public health, public land and wildlife. Since Bush took office, every day he has reniged on programs he agreed to while campaining. Every morning when I awake I give thanks that Colin Powel and Vice President Cheney are there with Bush because Bush is an idiot. So far everything he has touched has turned to rust.
