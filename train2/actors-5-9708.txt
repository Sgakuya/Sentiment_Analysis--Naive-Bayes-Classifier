Cate is a very interesting actress. Her films Elizabeth and The Talented Mr. Repley have shown that she would become a real good actress to be seen. It doesn t matter if the Academy doesn t recognize her poweful talent. After awarding actress with lacking of talent (Helen Hunt, Paltrow, Bassinger, Tomi...), what else can be said? What a shame!
