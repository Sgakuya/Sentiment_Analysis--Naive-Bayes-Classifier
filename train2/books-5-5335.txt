After reading magellan's comments, I know in my heart he is right and terrorists should elicit no sympathy, but the romantic in me wants to believe all people can love one another if given the chance - or in this case the catalist of a voice so magnificent as to soothe any savage beast. I loved the book and hold it in the highest esteem both for it's original plot, excellent writing and spell binding imagery. Except for the incompatible marriage at the very end, I thought the ending was, in fact, the only ending.
