Wachovia is by far the worst bank ever. Two days ago I had a small account with an available balance of $35.00. My ledger balance was $65.00 but I had a charge card on hold of $30.00 that had not yet cleared. I deposited into an ATM a check for $100.00 dollars and immediately withdrew it and they charged me $120.00 as an UNAVAILABLE FUNDS FEE. So the next morning when I went in I expected $35.00 in my account but instead was overdrawn to -$85.00. I called and complained and AS USUAL they will split the diffence and credited half of it back leaving me with a balance of $-25.00. So after the all day conversation I went directly to the bank at the teller and deposited $80.00 in cash. But because it was 7 minutes after the cut off time it was credited to the next day. I still had no indication when I went back and online because it showed that my balance was $55.00. So overnight the $30.00 check charge clears and I look on my statement and I now have an overdraft charge of $30.00 leaving me with a balance of $25.00. They said that because I handed cash to late yesterday that it wasnt credited until today. So I open my statement up yesterday and they put the overdraft fee into yesterdays activity and backdated the charge stating that it caused the charge on hold to overdraft. Then when I complained the Supervisor said I was lying and when I asked him to review the notes of my conversation yesterday he said there were none. WOW! (What if this had been my master account?)
