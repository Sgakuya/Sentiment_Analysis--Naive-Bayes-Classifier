Jennifer Garner is so beautiful and way too underrated!! She has such an adorable face. I like how she's not all anorexic looking like some actresses. She has muscle baby! I also like how she admits that her weight isn't perfect and she doesn't lie about it like some people. I think she's a good actress, and that she needs better roles to show that. And like on edgex said, Looks like a man? You people need to level out on the crack intake. That is sooo true.
