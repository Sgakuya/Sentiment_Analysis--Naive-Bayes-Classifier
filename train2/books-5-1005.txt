It's books like this that make me miss reading kids books, maybe I should go back to them! I look forward to having kids someday so I can get them to read the books I found so wonderful when I was a kid. This book included. I remember reading this in school when I was younger, and it was also read aloud to us. It was my favorite part of the day, when the teacher would read it to us. This book is where two kids get to go a fantasy world and help save the last Whangdoodle from extinction (along with the help of their professor friend). Really inspiring for kids who love fantasies and who need to be motivated.
