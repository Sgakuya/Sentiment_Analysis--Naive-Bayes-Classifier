I agree with the majority of individuals that have rated this bank. I have a 17 year old son that has graduated and is working a full time job. We contacted US bank which I have dealt with for over 25 years and attempted to set up a checking account for him. We were told since he was not legal age they would not open the account he would need to use savings as his option. This caused me to have to write checks for items for him and transfer funds from his savings to my checking. Little did they tell us that after 6 transactions like this in a month time they charge you for the transactions. They had the nerve to state that this charge was Federally mandated because the government wants to have people saving money and not spending it. How do you pay your bills then is my question? Now I just logged on line to check my balance and like the other comments I just read the balance on my account shows that I have the money in my account to cover all of the transactions I had outstanding yet I am charged for 3 overdraft fees of $33 each. Here is the clarification I received when I called the service center. You had 3 deposits that had not been verified yet. One of these was cash (how much does it take to verify cash?) The other 2 were checks so I can partly understand but in this case these checks amounted to over half of what I had in the account. Did they work to the customer's advantage and process the smaller checks first? Of course not, they charged the largest check first, then the withdrawl of cash and then the 2.00 check so it cost me 99.00 for them to process 22.00. What is wrong with this picture other than they are a bunch of crooks! For the amount of charges that this banks milks people out of I am thoroughly disgusted and will be closing all 3 accounts with them and finding a more reliable establishment to deal with!
