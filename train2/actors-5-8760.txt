The world is just about to experience what it feels to watch the most beautiful, sweetest and sensational woman in Hollywood history. 13 Going On 30 is coming out on April 23rd and I can't wait... That's of course for the non-believers of one of the best shows on TV - Alias. Because if you've been watching for the last 3 years, there is no way you are NOT in love with Jennifer. Unlike just about every woman in Hollywood, Jennifer is NOT crazy like Angelina Jolie. Or FAKE like Britney Spears. Or STUPID like Paris Hilton. No, she is none of those things. She is very smart, very sweet, really funny, very honest and humble - and she loves her family. Add to this how incredibly beautiful and talented she is, and there simply is no one better... EVER! Plus, she can kick your ass! Go Jen!
