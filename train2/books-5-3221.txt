McCammon's epic masterwork told through the eyes of nuclear war survivors. The plot is similar to King's The Stand, but is preferred by many due to the fact that McCammon trims the fat better than King... McCammon's characterizations are complete but never go overboard, something that King detractors will complain of endlessly. This novel can be beautiful and terrorizing, sometimes within the same chapter. I'd say this book is one of McCammon's shining hours, and in fact I think he's a better author than either King or Koontz.
