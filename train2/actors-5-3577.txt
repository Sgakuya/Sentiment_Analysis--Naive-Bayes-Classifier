I love him as an actor, he's very talented and has charisma, but as a person I'm not so sure, even if he's obviously rather charming, has a melancholy voice... I mean, how come somebody reportedly so sensitive and so kind is not a vegetarian and doesn't seem to care about animals at all !? Really sensitive people are always vegetarian, or end up becoming so, and do care about animals, not only about people! There is so much to be done about animals, bad treatments and torture are usual, so why doesn't he try and do something ?...
