As a director Tim Burton is brilliant. His style is his own. Dark, beautiful, rich and uncomprimising. His work as a director shows a great amount of heart and a beautifully morbid and welcomly so sense of humor. Tim Burton has a big heart. Onr that is aparent in each film he does. There is also an over town of darkness, almost a shadow that stands foe Burton himself. His works show an eccentric genius, a director whose work can never be duplicated for there is no other like Tim Burton. He does not set out to create run of the mill genre films. He creates his own worls and plains of exzistence. Tim Burton is a visionary, and I feel each and every film he has made is a work of art.
