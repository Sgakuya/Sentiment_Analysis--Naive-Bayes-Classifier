Ford is complete crap. I would rather push a Chevy than drive a ford. But realistically I have seen more fords being pushed than any other brand. Looks like a quality issue to me. But then again fords are cheaper to buy so that is why there are so many on the road. Most people can't afford a Chevy or it's quality. You get what you pay for. I have seen tons of rebuilt ford trucks from the 1940's and 1950's that were rebuilt with Chevy crate motors and parts. They have stickers that say "BUILT FORD TOUGH WITH CHEVY STUFF". Now that's truth in advertising. "Have you driven a ford lately??" HELL NO!!
