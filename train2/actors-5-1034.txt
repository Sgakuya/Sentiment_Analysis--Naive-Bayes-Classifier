I must agree, even though I don't care for all of the movies Tom Hanks has starred in, I loved him in BIG. He did such a wonderful job, that I will always give him a chance at the movie theatre. But I don't always review an actor because of their movies. I do it for their acting, and looks overall. Tom Hanks is an awesome actor, and as for his looks, he was so hot in the 80's, and he just looks like a regular middle aged guy now. Nothing wrong with that. Great actor, great guy. I encourage everyone to enjoy one of his many famous movies. He deserves every award he has received thus far...
