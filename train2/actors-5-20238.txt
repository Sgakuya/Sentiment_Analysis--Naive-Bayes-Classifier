One of the few younger (more or less) actresses who is on the same par talent-wise as Meryl Streep. Helen has range and ability and her impressive work has covered a broad spectrum of both drama and comedy. I won t say she was wasted on television s Mad About You , but she did help make that show and it was evident that she could easily transcend the small screen. Which she obviously has done very successfully.
