This book was given as a reason for the murder of John Lennon. Shortly after that unfortunate incident, I bought a copy of this book, but couldn't read it because each time I picked it up, it brought back the terrible memories of that December night. When I finally did read it,it quickly became one of my favorite books. While I agree with Holden and his feelings on the phonieness of everything, I don't see how this could lead to murder. The book is well written and Salinger makes you want to care for who is essentially a poor charecter who is hard to like. It should be read by everyone.
