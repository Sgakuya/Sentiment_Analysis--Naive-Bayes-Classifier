 I don't make a habit of killing time Staring like a zombie at the T.V. screen But I do believe that if I'm not deceived I've just discovered me a dreamboat queen. I've been watching you I can see you but you can't see me I've been watching you Walking through my world of fantasy. Oh, Lucy Liu, you could make a wreck out of a man like me, oh, so easily, Lucy Liu, Lucy Liu. Oh, Lucy Liu, I am blind I cannot see What's happening to me, Lucy Liu, Lucy Liu, Lucy Liu... If you want more you'll just have to check out the song. Here's a clue. Go to Yahoo and search for britpop AND lucy Liu. This song is dedicated to you, Lucy, from all your dedicated fans in the U.K. Thanks so much, Lucy, we'll love you for ever.
