Idiotic, irreverent sense of humor, and complete nut case I love this guy! How could I not, he s responsible for two of my all time favorite movies Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein which contain some of the best comic lines in the history of film. I haven t been in love with everything he s ever done but to me he will always be the king of spoofs and parodies
