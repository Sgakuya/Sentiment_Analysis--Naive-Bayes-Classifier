The Da Vinci code is about a Harvard symboligist Robert Langdon who is called late at night to the Louvre museum where the curator has been murdered. Besides the body are symbols which lead Langdon to find more clues in the works of Leonardo Da Vinci. He joins forces with a cryptologist and from there the story unfolds into an exhilarating, mind blowing, smart thriller. One of the best books I've read in a long time. Dan Brown weaves a fine intricate story that hooks the reader from the beginning
