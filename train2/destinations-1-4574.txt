I lived in Houston for little over two years and I am never going back. The place is a hellhole. I absolutely hated the fact that it's almost impossible to walk in Houston, there just aren't any sidewalks for pedestrians. Everyone in Houston owns a car and that is why the traffic is just horrendous. Houston's air quality is one of the worst in the US because of the traffic and the petrochemical industry in the region. The pollution is especially bad in the summer when you add 100 degree heat and nearly 100 percent humidity to the equation. It's not all that rare to have like 3-4 ozone watch days a week during the summer in Houston. Houstonians seem to be very keen on their so called Memorial "park". Sure it's nice if you enjoy jogging in a "park" where there is on one side of the "park" a freeway and on the other side a multilane highway (Memorial drive). Talk about a refreshing experience. The greatest myth about the Houston weather is that it's only bad for like 3-4 months a year. Yeah right, the heat and humidity are really bad from early May till early November and just plain bad the rest of the year. There may a couple of nice days every now and then but that's it. If you enjoy spending a lot of time indoors then Houston just might be your place. Texans as people are nice in general, that is if you agree with their views and enjoy the same things that they do. At least for me, I felt like an outsider most of the time when the discussion came down to politics, religion, music, guns etc. Houston just wasn't for me.
