I am absolutely in love with Mark Wahlberg and will always be a dedicated fan. I love every movie that he has been in especially Fear. Fear is my all time favorite movie, he drives me crazy in that movie. He is perfect in every way his acting, his BODY, his smile, and his accent. I love it all and always will.
