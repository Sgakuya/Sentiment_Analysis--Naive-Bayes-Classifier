I grew up in Massachusetts, moved away for 12 years and then came back. How stupid stupid I was to come back to this awful state. The people are ignorant and rude and stupid for paying 500K for a lousy house. Is it to much to ask to put you shopping cart back or wait your turn in line and how come you think your more important then me to jump ahead of everyone when driving. Most Massachusetts residence have never lived anywhere else so the dont know how bad the quality of life is here in the bay state. Here a recent situation, we were outside with a neighbor and her 2-year-old son when another condo owner drives by and waives at us to say Hi. She said What's wrong with him, it's like he wants to touch children. Why cant the people be nice to each other, everyone has attitudes and I cant figure out why? I left and came back, have my family now and will leave ass soon as possible. I cant imagine raising my family in a place like this, no class system where you can make over 100K/Yr and not give your family a great life with a nice house and great schools. Massachusetts is a great place to visit to visit but you dont want to live here. Unless you have lived other places you are blind to the living conditions in this state.
