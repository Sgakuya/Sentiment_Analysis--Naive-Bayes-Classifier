When he wanted to act, he could do it. He won an Oscar in "From Here to Eternity." I also recommend "The Man With a Golden Arm," "Manchurian Candidate," "Von Ryan's Express," and others. In a lot of films, however, he walked through them or traded on his image. A good example is "Ocean's Eleven" although it is a thousand times better than the George Clooney-Julia Roberts recent product.
