The skills of David Hyde Pierce proves that physical comedy isn't dead. In the process of his character Niles Crane on sitcom 'Frasier', he brings the anti-macho man to the little screen. Along with in particular Kelsey Grammer and Jane Leeves on 'Frasier', he is able to deliver little bits of the homo sapiens race to the rest of us. Pierce gets a mark in my book.
