Yea, we think of him as being rather sinister but he's another guy that got his start on broadway. He can sing and dance pretty dang well. He's got a unique look and a unique way of speaking. Along with all his others, The Dead Zone was very good. Funny appearance in Mouse Hunt . Christopher is another of the legends that everyone knows and everyone loves.
