She is a great actress! I think that the best part about her career in the movie industry is that, because she can do a large variety of films (ex. comedy, to romance, to suspense) you never get bored of watching her films. Even if she didn't have a variety of films, I still don't think you'd get bored though, because she is so great at what she does.
