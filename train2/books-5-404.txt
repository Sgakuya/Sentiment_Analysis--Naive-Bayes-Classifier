I first read these novels in the 5th grade, and only recently took the time to read them again, and in my opinion, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the best of the entire series. This book certainly opens up your imagination every time you read it. The characters are very well-developed, and the book is written in a language that mature children can understand. A great novel!
