I have to agree that he is one of the most wonderful, atractive, absolutely delightful actors ever.Though I do have to say he will never replace Val Kilmer as my all time favorite actor;but he is the only man that I think could hold a candle up to Val.I've only seen him in 2 movies but I loved them both.I saw Sense and Sensibility (why she picked Willoughby I will never know),and Galaxy Quest,and I am definetly going to see all the Harry Potter movies;but I have found through this section some movies that I have to see.But (and don't be mad at me) Val is still better. :)Update I saw Die Hard.That movie is exelant!!!!! :) Mikki
