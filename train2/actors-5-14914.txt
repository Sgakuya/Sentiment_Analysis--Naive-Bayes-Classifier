I have to give her a 5. She is easily the most recognised child actress there is. She was most famous in the 1930s when the USA was at is lowest and had a way of brightening up the world. Although she was pretty good as an actress her biggest talent to me was her dancing. wow could that little girl dance. her singing was fine pretty much like a little kid would sing. Just the fact that even in 2003, she still has some popularity to her is something. I think thanks to videos and tv. more generations can love this sweet little girl who could tap up a storm.
