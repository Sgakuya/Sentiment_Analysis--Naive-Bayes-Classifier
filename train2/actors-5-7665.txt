I don't like Star Trek very much, but I really like Bill Shatner. I remember an interview or two with other original ST actors speaking about how obnoxious and egocentric Shatner was/is and I thought it was interesting. I paid a little more attention to Shatner, and I've noticed that he seems to do exactly what he wants and is perfectly confident in himself; he doesn't care what anyone thinks about him. I admire that. I find Shatner to be very dry and funny and I'm sure he'd be great to have a conversation with. as an actor, he is always willing to stick his neck out to entertain the audience. His over-the-top acting style puts him in the same company as Christopher Walken et al.; Shatner always dominates the screen and attacks each assignment with gusto. A classic actor and one of the most recognizable men on the planet.
