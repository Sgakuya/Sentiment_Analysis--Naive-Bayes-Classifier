Susan Sarandon has every right to express her opinions. And those who disagree with her have just as much right to express their outrage. (she made some terrible statements that offended me long before this war started) There's no sense in telling her to leave the country. However....people like Alec Baldwin who PROMISED they would leave if Bush won, should at least keep their word.
