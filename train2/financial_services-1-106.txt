I am in the process of repaying back my student loans with Wells Fargo simply because...I just graduated from Wells College, which are affiliated. I handed in my application before July 1. 2005, when interest rates were scheduled to go up. It is now the end of October and not only has my loan not been processed, the LOST my original application. I can prove it because I have been keeping good records about when applications and other important documents pertaining to my loans were sent in. I made copies of all orginal documents that were signed and dated by myself, and then wrote the date on which the copy is made. They made it seem as though I was the one at fault for losing the application which clearly is not so. I am terrified that I am not going to get the lower interest rates I applied for and HAVE BEEN TOLD by their 9 thousands reps I've seem to have spoken with. I advise any recent college graduate to find another financial institution in which to go about repaying back loans.
