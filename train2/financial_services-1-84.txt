Hi im no idiot when it comes to banking and even have a friend with mba from yale who knows this bank is bad business. What ever you do do not get a check card with this bank and you will be fine. They have a kickback agreement with visa wich allows the computer to vary the length it holds transaction. STAY AWAy FROM THIS BANK IF YOU WANT TO BE SAFE USE MONEY ORDERS
