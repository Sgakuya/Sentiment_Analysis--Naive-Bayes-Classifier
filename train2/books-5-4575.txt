Of Mice and Men's characters are practically archetypal in our society. The small, quick man paired with the great, kind hearted child has been repeated in many variations. What makes this book remarkable, however, is all the other themes Steinbeck works in. In addition to friendship, we have the American Dream, a Brotherhood of Knights, racial tension, ageism, and power structure. This book is the only one consistently rated high by my sophmore students.
