I am not a fan of Hepburn but I've watched many of her films. And I found her marvelous.I must say that Katharine has been the most successful actress of all time so far. Her talent has been recognized by the Adademy (4 oscars and 12 nominations), the Media, and the critics. Although Hepburn doesn't have many fans of my age (25), she certainly has a lot of people that respect her career so much.
