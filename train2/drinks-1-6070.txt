While visiting Wrightsville Beach, NC last summer, I stopped by Harris Teeter and snagged a 12-pack of Cheerwine after seeing a few trucks driving around. It tasted like flat cherry Dr. Pepper. As far as southern beverages go, Sun Drop won hands down - and we had a lot of cheerwine left over for the drive back. I gave some to friends when I got home and they also commented on how flat it seemed.
