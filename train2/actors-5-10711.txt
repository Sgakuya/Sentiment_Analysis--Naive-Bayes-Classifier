A deserving oscar winner and 3 time nominee. Her body of work is very impressive and has crossed from comedy to drama to ensemble work. I personally have not seen a large amount of her work but can honestly say what I have seen showed how good she is. Her performance is either the best in a movie or nearly the best. When considering all those she has acted with as a supporting cast member and as the female lead that is amazing.
