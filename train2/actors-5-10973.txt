Lauren Bacall is one of the last of the great actresses from Hollywood's Golden era. Great when she was younger, Bacall is still a great actress today who shows class and style. And unlike today's actresses who whine and moan over everything, Bacall has shown remarkable grace and dignity. I think Bogey would be proud.
