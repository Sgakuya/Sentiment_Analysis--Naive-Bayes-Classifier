This previous comment is an example of what is wrong with Harvard. The fact that Harvard is an epitome of an ivy, or that it is old tells us nothing about quality. Someone should address real issues like grade inflation (how in the world does 80% of a school average As) and the fact that you get a 20K education for 50K.
