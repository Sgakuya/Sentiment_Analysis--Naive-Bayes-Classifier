When I read this in high school, it was boring. Now that I've read it again in college, it is genius. If you look beyond the surface of all the characters and their actions, you'll see Shakespeare work his one of a kind magic of incredible symbolism and wit. One can see how Juliet is cunning and manipulative, with not just love as her ultimate goal but freedom, and one can see how Romeo is demasculinized and eroticized by and for both sexes in the play. Brilliant, just brilliant.
