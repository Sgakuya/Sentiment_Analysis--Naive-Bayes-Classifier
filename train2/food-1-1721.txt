Twizzlers are nothing compared to Red Vines. I don't understand how anyone could like these waxy strings of weird cherry tasting things. Twizzlers are horrible. It is hard for me to find a candy that I will turn down and I wouldn't take a Twizzler. It isn't right. The look, feel and taste of Twizzlers are just wrong. Red Vines are so much better. I don't know how you can go so wrong with licorcie.
