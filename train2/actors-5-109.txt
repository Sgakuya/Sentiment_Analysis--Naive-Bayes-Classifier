He is one of the hottest classic actors ever! Suave ,debonaire, and charming describe Cary Grant. He also had great talent to boot! I will never forget him in such films as Philadelphia Story, to Catch a Thief, North by Northwest, Suspicion, Charade, and many more. It is amazing to me that he never won an Oscar for any of those roles. He certainly should have. It's not necessarily a fact that he had an affair with a guy so I don't let it tarnish my image of him. That's his personal life anyway.
