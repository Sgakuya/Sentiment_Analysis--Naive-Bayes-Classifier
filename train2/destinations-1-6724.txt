Dear AEenzRU What in your opinion gives Mormons the right to judge other peoples 'values'? What gives any 'red state'-like Utah to judge anyones morals- Just curious. I would agree with you on the states interesting physical geography- I however find your concepts on 'family' and 'moral values' to be rather subjective and narrow. Therefore the opinions expressed here thus far on the 'Mormon Culture' have some objective validity- the state sadly to say deserves this low rating- not based on its physical prowess- but its strangling closeted fearful culture.
