A big fat 0 would give this bank too much credit!!!!! I had a series of withdraws "made" from my account which I know could have been nothing else then a ghost. I say this because I still had my atm card, and I have never told anyone my pin number. In addition I reviewed the security camera recordings with the head of security from the bussiness where the atm was located, and no one used the atm during these "transactions". I guess a ghost used an invisable potion on the card and then withdrew money. The best is yet to come. The main reel in the atm showed that no such transactions ever occured. So you tell me what happend!!! The "investigators" did nothing more then verify that according to their system the atm card with the proper pin number was used. Even after being given the phones numbers of the people to contact reguarding the evidence, they refused to do nothing!! Nothing except let an employee get away with stealing money. Now I am attempting to take them to small claims court to retrieve my money. This bank is the biggest crock of....well never mind. My feelings are evident.
