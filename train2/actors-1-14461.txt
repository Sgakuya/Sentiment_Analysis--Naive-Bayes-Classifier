I know little about her 'cept her stint on Charmed and dating Marilyn Manson. I'm giving her the one star because if you were engaged to a Satanist then you must be one yourself. But starring as the bad girl in movies when you hang out with the wrong crowd doesn't really make you much of an actor because you are only being yourself. HouseofM, I think she DOES deserve the nasty comments and even so still I think people are being kind to her. I'm being too kind to her. But if some people are ok with somebody dating a devil worshipper then I say birds of a feather flock together.
