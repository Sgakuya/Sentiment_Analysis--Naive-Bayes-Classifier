Ethan Hawke is a pompous, pretentious, bratty little jackass. That's my opinion, which is the point of this website. His movies suck, and he is nowhere near as intelligent or literary as he likes to present himself as. He probably sucks as a person as well, though that is just speculation, I don't know the guy.
