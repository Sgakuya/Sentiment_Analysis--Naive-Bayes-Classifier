They have to be one of the MOST predatory cellular companies out there. I was a long time customer with several phones and my bills were always over $100 a month. When I moved out of the area, I could not get a signal at all at work and a very weak one at home. After complaining several times I got nowhere and signed up with cingular. Meanwhile I was hit with TWO early termination fees for two phones at $200 bucks a pop in addition to my last two months of service of $349. Instead of working with me they passed it off to collections where I was able to get them to knock off 20%. Pretty sad day when you can get better results from a collections agency than the original company! So much for customer loyalty. DO NOT USE CELLULAR ONE! If you do, tell them to shove their 2 year contract where the sun does not shine!
