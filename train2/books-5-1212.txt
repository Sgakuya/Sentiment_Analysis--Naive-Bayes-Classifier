Greatest comic strip in history. Of all time. Snoopy's not even close. Imaginative, funny, brilliant, slightly educational, and it's always cute how they never do resolve the issue if Hobbes is either a figment of Calvin's imagination or a doll that magically comes to life when he's alone with Calvin. I prefer the latter. It's more fun that way.
