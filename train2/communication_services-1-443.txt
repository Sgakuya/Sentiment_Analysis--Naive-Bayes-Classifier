Very Poor reception, many dropped calls, and my experiences with the rude and inept Customer Service Reps. have been extremely frustrating. They also add an unbelievable amount of subcharges that add up quickly and result in an obscene bill. Go elsewhere for your Mobile Service. All other companies offer the same services (only better) without all of the added fees.
