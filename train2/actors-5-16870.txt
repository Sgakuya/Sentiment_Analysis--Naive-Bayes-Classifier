You are sadly missed, I don't watch the show much now, because you and many others have left. It is the same hum drum thing Day after Day after day..... The new actress they put in your place, can not even begin to fill your shoes, she can't cry very well. And she doesn't add that every day feeling to the Cassie that so many of us loved. I hate what they have done to Guiding Light. It may have been the longest running soap. But it won't be for long. Every one has quit watching. Including my mother who has watched for a very long time. Miss you terribly......
