Despite catalogue listings, diversity of courses offered is poor. Books were community college level or lower. UMUC staff unprofessional and unresponsive. Instructors dumb down courses to allow many to pass course in the open enrollment system. Psychology courses are of very poor quality by comparison with other colleges.
