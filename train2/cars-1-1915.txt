I had to drive one of these around for a month while my van was having some body work done to it. I hated it! I was to the point of screaming at the body shop for making me drive that peice of crap. It was a brand new one too! You can hear every sound outside the door and if you drive it down a gravel road, make sure you wear ear protectors. The radio reception was incredible unreliable as well.
