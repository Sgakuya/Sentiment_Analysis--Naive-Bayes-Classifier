I have to shield my eyes whenever one drives by or I get a headache. I find it unbelivable that a designer could design something this ugly, that a group of production managers could approve it, that workers with reasonable vision would show up to work the second day to build more of them, that dealerships would put them out where the public could see them, that anyone would buy one, that banks would loan money to help, or that insurance companys would actually want to see a wrecked one repaired. I truely belive this is where humanity has jumped the shark.
