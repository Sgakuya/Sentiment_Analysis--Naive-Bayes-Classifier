You know, its shockingly sad to see people giving this dump 4 and 5 star ratings. Iran has more freedom than most nations in the Mid East? Did you know that homosexuals in Iran can be hung, stoned, or even tortured to death? Safe, free place, huh? The ultimate hypocrisy on this board just amazes me. There are several liberal raters here who supposedly support gay rights but then they go and rate Iran highly. Let's face it folks: We need to ban Iran.
