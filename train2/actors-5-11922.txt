Yes, Angelina is definately a favorite of mine! Yes, she's beautiful. But most importantly, the girl can act. She is a wonderful artist and I am glad she is at a stage in her life where she is completely content and happy. And as far as her fans are concerned, that's a plus. It means that her career can only go farther now and there will be more art for us to watch!!!!
