Ever since I saw Empire of the Sun, I have been mesmerized with Christian bale. His performances are always subtle,intelligent and thoroughly believable. if you have never seen a movie with Christian bale in it, I would suggest Little Women and Newsies for kids and teens. For adults, I think Velvet Goldmine, All the Little Animals, and Empire of the Sun are all good choices. After you've seen a couple of his movies, I think you will understand what the Baleheads are so excited about!
