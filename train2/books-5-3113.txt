The only King novel that freaked me out more than this one was It. I can't thik of a more mature and compelling treatment of the living dead than the story this novel comtains. There was no way a film version could do justice to this story and seeing the film... I was right. King was at the height of his powers when he wrote this story. A masterpiece.
