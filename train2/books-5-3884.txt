This is my favorite novel. Mark Twain's humor is so timeless I can totally relate to it over a hundred years later. A lot of worthy classic books take a lot of discipline to read, but this one is so entertaining that it's easy. His style is so detailed it makes me feel like I'm living in the time and place he is writing about. Since he's a first hand witness I must be getting well educated! Tom Sawyer, also a good one, should be read first, but Huck Finn is even better.
