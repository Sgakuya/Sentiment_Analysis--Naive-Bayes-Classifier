I believe that Sunsan Sarandon is one of the best thespians out there. Not only for managing to be a great actor, but also because she stands up for what she believes in , even to the point of bieng arrested, I dont think alot of people have the courage to do that. She is a not only a great actress but a great activist for what she believes in and I think that is very important, especially if you have th power to change something you believe in.
