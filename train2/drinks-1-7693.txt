Whisky (non Scottish:Whiskey) is NOT bourbon. and I am surprised that no single malt (real highland whisky) is listed here. What happened to Oban, Glenkinchie, Glenfiddich, Talisker, Lagavulin, Cragganmore?! Surely any one of these Whiskys is far superior that the mass market junk that is listed here?!
