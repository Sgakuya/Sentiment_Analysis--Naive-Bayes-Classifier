I must admit this is the worst cereal I have ever had. I dealt with a few boxes of this for the photoballs and as I go through the box, even though I know I am going to get a photoball of one of my favorite players, I wonder Is it really worth it??? I don't think I'll ever go through that again, whether it's healthy or not. I think I might as well eat some cardboard with a bunch of vitamins, that's basically what it is. Once Wheaties is all there is left in the world to eat, I'll start looking for a tall building.
