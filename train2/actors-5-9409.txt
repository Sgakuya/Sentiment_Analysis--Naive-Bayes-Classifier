I don't like a lot of the roles she chooses, but she plays them like no one else. Does anyone else remember her as a child star on the TV show, The Courtship of Eddie's Father ? She was great in The Accused . I think that was actually her best role. And, you felt her pain in Silence of the Lambs . Here's an actress who's not just another pretty face - in fact, as actresses go, she's not one of the prettier faces, but the feelings sure do show.
