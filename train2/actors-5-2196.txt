Anyone who makes me laugh, has my heart! Robin Williams got my heart years ago! He is the funniest, most talented actor around. I adore him unconditionally. This man can do no wrong in my eyes. If I am feeling down, I rent a Robin Williams movie and he lifts me right up! This man's talent cannot be rated - there are not enough stars. He is superb!
