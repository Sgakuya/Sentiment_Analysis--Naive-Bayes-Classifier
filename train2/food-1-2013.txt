First of all the name Good Plenty irritates me. It's too long and gramatically incorrect. N by itself is trashy and I suggest a sign. This candy is terrible. Black licorice alone is gross. To add a stale candy coating in colors like white and pink does nothing for its desirability. They need to find a way for the coating not to crumble when you try to chew it. Candy coating and sticky licorice do not work well.
