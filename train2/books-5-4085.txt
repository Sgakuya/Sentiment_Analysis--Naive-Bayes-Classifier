This book helped inspire me to seek out my own hapiness. Praises logic, self-sacrifice, and the willingness to follow ones own goals and desires. I enjoy reading historical fiction, and the parallels between Siddhartha in the book and the real Siddhartha Guatama(the Buddha) are interesting. This book tells the reader to be responsible for their own destiny and hapiness-an inspiring message.
