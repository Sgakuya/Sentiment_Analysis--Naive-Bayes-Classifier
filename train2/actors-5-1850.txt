I think he is the best actor EVER, i know thats saying a lot. But look at the roles he has done, can you picture anybody else having the talent to do the things hes done? I didnt think so, all those old time actors simply play characters not too unlike themselves, not Johnny, he plays eccentric crazy people that are the exact opposite of him, noone has ever been better.
