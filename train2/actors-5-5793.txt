Another actor ROBBED of an Oscar. I work with children who are mildly mentally retarded. When I saw "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", I did not know who Leo was. I thought to myself, "Wow. This is awesome. They were able to teach an MMR boy how to act. They probably had to film one line at a time..." I was just blown away that someone MMR could act so well. And then I found out the Leo was NOT MMR but was just acting. Extremely realistic. Plus he's another hottie that I wouldn't mind getting to know...
