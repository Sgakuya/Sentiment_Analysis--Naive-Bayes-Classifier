Being from Boston, I can say it is the worst place period. It is cold, damp and depressing. The winters are harsh and there is nothing to do. It is so awful that I am dreaming of the moment that I can move. Because there is nothing to do here people only care about sports.Thats it, nothing but sports and drinking. Most people here drink day in and day out. Could be an explanation for the terrible accents. I get so frustrated when people from other places question why I do not have an accent. They dont understand, how I could have lived here my whole life and sound normal? What most people dont realize, is that not every one from Boston talks that way. If you are from the wealthier suburbs for example.. Wayland, Weston etc you DO NOT SPEAK WITH AN ACCENT. This is a mind boggling concept for people that are not from this area. It is a fact though, one that I had to get off my chest :) thanks for listening Lets not forget the corrupt politics or the horrible cost of living Just had to throw that in there.
