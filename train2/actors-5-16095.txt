I have the utmost respect for Maurice. He's very giving to his fellow actors and fans. He's the most amazing performer on daytime television and he's the only reason MANY people tune into General Hospital. His willingness to share his experience with Manic Depression is admirable and his devotion to his family is endearing. Maurice Benard is THE number ONE man on daytime TV!!
