Regardless of the criteria you use to judge a movie director, it would be extremely difficult to claim that Spielberg is any less than great. Do you need a masterpiece to be considered great? Spielberg has several movies that might qualify, but I'd point to Schindler's List. Do you need a large body of quality work? Few other directors match Spielberg's resume. Do you need to prove that you can direct movies in different genres? Spielberg gave us a horror movie (Jaws), a sci-fi movie, (E.T.), a war movie (Saving Private Ryan), a special-effects action movie (Jurassic Park), and a serious, powerful drama (Schindler's List). Maybe you can make a case that Spielberg hasn't done anything truly ground-breaking, but that argument is questionable and not nearly strong enough to prevent him from earning five stars. I agree with CastleBee - Spielberg is one of the most talented and prolific directors of our time.
