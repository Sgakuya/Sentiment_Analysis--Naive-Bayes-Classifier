Excellent collection of short stories. Movies that you may have seen that originated here: Graveyard Shift, Trucks(Maximum Overdrive), Sometimes They Come Back, The Ledge(Cat's Eye), The Lawnmower Man, Quitter's Inc.(Cat's Eye), Children Of The Corn(unlike the movie, the story was scary!). Highlights: The Boogey Man(I was scared of slightly ajar closet door for most of my childhood, thanks to this one), I Am The Doorway, Battleground(a boy's nightmare/dream come true), Sometimes They Come Back(very disturbing), Strawberry Spring, The Last Rung On The Ladder. The is easily the best of King's short story collections, surpassing Skeleton Crew, Four Past Midnight Nightmares And Dreamscapes. The others don't come close!
