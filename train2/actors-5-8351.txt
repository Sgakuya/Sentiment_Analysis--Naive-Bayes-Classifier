Judy Garland was so much more than The Wizard of Oz ...her musicals and dramatic roles were phenominal... Meet Me in St. Louis Easter Parade and A Star is Born just to name a few. A shame she couldn't control her addictions...I wonder if things would have been different if she had the availability of support groups and programs that are so prevelent today.
