I said that Alfred Hitchcock deserves #1 on this list, but Mel Brooks deserves #1 + 1. He is by name, the best director ever born. He has made some of the greatest movies ever thought up by man. He deserves so much more credit. The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, History Of the World, and many, many more.
