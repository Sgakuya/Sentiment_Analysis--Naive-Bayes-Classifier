Seinfeld would have still been funny without Elaine, but she fit in perfectly and introduced a really important perspective to an otherwise all-male group of main characters. What perfect casting - Louis-Dreyfus is cute but not distractingly beautiful, sarcastic, intelligent, and surprisingly good at physical humor (her go-to move of yelling Get out! while shoving someone, the goofy dancing with the thumbs and little kicks). I can't think of any other actresses who could have pulled off Elaine as well as Dreyfus did. Which surprised me a lot, because she wasn't all that funny when she spent a season or two on Saturday Night Live. Now that Seinfeld is no more, Dreyfus, like Michael Richards, is going to have a really hard time breaking away from the Seinfeld label. Every time I see her in something, she'll still be Elaine.
