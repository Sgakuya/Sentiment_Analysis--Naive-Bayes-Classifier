The only criticism I have of PTA is that he is TOO talented for his own good. I mean, the man is obviously a virtuoso, but it seems like he's showing off his virtuosity at every turn. He also seems to attract the best actors in the business (he even got a really good performance from Adam Sandler, I will admit.) If I were a Hollywood film maker, I'd be ashamed to call myself a director after seeing his films, cause everyone else are mere hacks in comparison.
