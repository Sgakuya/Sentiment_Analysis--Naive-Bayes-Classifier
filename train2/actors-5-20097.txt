Could any one play the straight skeptic as credibly as Gillian? She is the key to selling the X-Files to the audience. Scully brings the show out of left field enought to make it touch reality in a way no other sci-fi imitation has done before. The sense of chemsitry between her and Fox Mulder, the plutonic relationship....first class. Her tone and the fact that she can make the show seem real is a fitting tribute to her strenght as an actress. Roll on Scully....
