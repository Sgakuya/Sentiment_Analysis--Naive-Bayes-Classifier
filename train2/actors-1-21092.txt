Can anyone REALLY take this victim of elective surgery seriously? No, of course not and this is precisely what she and her legion of spin-doctors, agents, and other promoters are counting on. Yet as dorky as her persona seems to most of us she will no doubt stick around - popping in and out of the public eye - until she s able to play simultaneous games of hacky sack with those expensive implants. By the end of her illustriously exploitive yet pointless career she will have contributed no more to the ever-fading artistic side of the entertainment industry and no greater impression on the world than Charo. But she will still retire richer than most of us and be able to have herself surgically realigned every 10 years or so. Not bad I suppose for a Barbie on steroids who otherwise might be selling real estate on cable TV.
