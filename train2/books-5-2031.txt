Gasoline Alley is art. I know it's a comic strip but...the artwork is what sets it apart from ALL the other strips. Jim Scancarelli has maintained the ideals of the original creator while keeping G.A. up to date since the beginning of his tenure as creator/artist. The talent required to handle all aspects (hand drawing/inking/storyline/humor) is rare in comics today. Long live Jeem!
