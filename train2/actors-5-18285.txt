A master of cinematography. Wherever his movies fall short (acting, length, etc...) his scene development, camera angles (and I stress ANGLES), colors, use of light and shadows, costumes, dialogue, and ability to create a story all highlight Kubrick's unparalleled genius. Can scare the hell out of you one minute, make you split your sides laughing the next minute, and then have you pondering philosophical questions at the end. One of the greatest.
