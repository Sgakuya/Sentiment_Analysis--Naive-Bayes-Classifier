Any character with manners any less than Greg's character in Sabrina will never do - for me. With his talent, though, he will show us those characters, too, will get the credit he deserves, along with the leading rolls. A fan since flannel-flipping a few years ago when I was stopped by the charismatic smile (wow). Truly a gentleman who was extremely kind when I interrupted his lunch in Tucson last week he graciously posed for a picture -- and from Indiana! Talented, gorgeous actor who is nice, too! I may have to dump John Mellencamp.
