Halle is one of the most beautiful, self-respecting, seemingly down to earth (let alone talented) actresses that has ever graced Hollywood. She is a true Lady in the full meaning of the word and her gracefulness it to be admired. She is truly someone that is an excellent role model for your black girls/women.
