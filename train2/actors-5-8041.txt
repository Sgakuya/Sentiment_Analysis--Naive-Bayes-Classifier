There has never been another actress like Audrey Hepburn. It annoys me when people compare her to Jennifer Love Hewitt and Natalie Portman. Although they are both pretty they are not Audrey Hepburn at all. Audrey was beautiful, talented, charming, and intelligent. She was not like alot of the other blonde bimbo actresses of the time. She was always smart and lovely at the same time. Who could ever forget her in such films as Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Charade, My Fair Lady,(one of my all time favorite movies). There were so many other wonderful films too. She always gave great performances. The lovely, enchanting, petite actress will never be forgotten because she lives on through her films and good works as a person.
