She's an awesome actress at playing both the good and the bad girl. *Ever see Cruel Intentions?* She's not just fake either, she really gets out there and DOES it all - she doesn't donate to charity organizations, she's out there hauling a shovel and that girl deserves credit for it!! Great person, beautiful and smart.
