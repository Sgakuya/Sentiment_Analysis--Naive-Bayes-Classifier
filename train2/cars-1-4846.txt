I have had nothing but trouble with my 1999 F-250 XLT. It has been in for SEVEN repairs all related to the pistons. Starting in January 2000 through today, SEVEN repairs. Most recently, a $2,000.00 valve replacement after a valve CRACKED. I use this truck for personal driving: it has NEVER towed a thing. No has it had anything larger than a lawn mower in the truck bed. I keep speaking with Ford, but they keep telling me nobody else has reported such problems.
