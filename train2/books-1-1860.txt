As Homer Simpson put it: You know what you two need? A little comic strip called 'Love Is...' It's about two naked eight-year-olds who are married. So if you reads the comics for cute I guess it might be OK, but I read the comics for funny , and these 2 naked 8-year olds just creeped me out, not funny at all.
