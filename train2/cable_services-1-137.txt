For anyone thinking of getting DirectTv, don't! I signed up for it in March and have had nothing but problems. Signal failures are common and customer service is horrible. The final straw just came as one of THEIR receivers decided to break down. I was told by their customer service department that I would have to pay for another receiver. The only way they would waive the fee, is if I agreed to another year of service. I couldn't believe it. Either I pay more money to compensate for their faulty equipment, or I agree to another year of lost signals and horrible customer service. Just get suckered into this company like I did!
