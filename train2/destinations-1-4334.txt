LA is just plain terrible and hell on earth. The people are shallow, rude, greedy and think that they're better than you. Life in LA is showing off your rich possessions such as your house in La Brea, your BMW or Mercedes and how many credit cards you own. Then there's horrible smog. For most of the year, I can hardly see the buildings in downtown. Then traffic. OMG! The 405 freeway is like a freakin parking garage! You also have to drive long distances and cars tend to break down easily in this kind of city. The whole city also looks like Mexico to me...bunch of illegal immigrants infiltrating the city. All in all, LA is plain hell.
