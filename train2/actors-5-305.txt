I'm not so much sure why he is counted as a current actor and not a classic one, but whatever. Whatever type of actor Mr. Peck may be, he is a first rate one. His performance in To Kill A Mockingbird was one the best performances to ever grace the silver screen. His performance in Roman Holiday was just plain sexy. He had the gift of playing off of his fellow actors and actresses. He used their talents to enhance his own performance. He took advantage of what he was given to work with. That's a great actor.
