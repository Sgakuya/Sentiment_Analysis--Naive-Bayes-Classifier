For a long time I never knew about this cartoon strip, until my Girl introduced this little wonder to me. What I like the most about this cartoon is, it actually talks a lot about those unspoken thoughts & gestures from your loved one and may be you too. Keep exploring love is, you would slowly get to know what 'Love' really 'Is'. - PP
