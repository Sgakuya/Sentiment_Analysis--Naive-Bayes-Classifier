I don't remember now if the car was 3 years old or 4 years old, but in any event, still decently new. Lost compression on the 1st cylinder, we would have had to either overhaul or replace the entire engine. The repair was going to just about run more than the value of the car (Ford Escorts don't depreciate well), and we had gotten the vehicle secondhand, so there was no warranty to fall back on. Traded that lemon in for a whopping $600 and considered it worth the loss to be done with it.
