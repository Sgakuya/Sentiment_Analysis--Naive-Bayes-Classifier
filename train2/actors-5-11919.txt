I am one of Angelina's most devoted fans, so it bites to be the one to ask WHO is choosing her roles? and WHY have her characters become so weak, as I suggest is true for Pushing Tin and Gone In 60 Seconds? I'm thankful to have another addition to my Angelina Collection, but face it, it just doesn't bring out her usual above average artistic product, which is unmistakable. Angelina, you are an angel to the camera, an antagonist to the mind, and certainly a true blessing to the spirit, where are more characters as you portrayed in Foxfire, Hackers, Gia, Girl Interrupted, Playing By Heart, Playing God...?
