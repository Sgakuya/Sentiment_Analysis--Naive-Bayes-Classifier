Believe it, this state is bad. I drove through here on the way to Florida. I stopped off in this strip mall, looked around, and realized I had stepped into mid-20th century America. This place doesn't change much, does it? I've lived in Cincinnati, which is pretty much the south, and trust me, I didn't want to stick around Georgia long enough to deal with the ignorant natives, especially since I'm black. People that hate Michigan should live here for awhile. That state is Cancun compared to the Peach state.
