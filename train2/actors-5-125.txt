When I was growing up, I only saw Bogart as a sort of cultural stereotype. It was only as an adult that I watched his movies and realized what a truly great actor he was. If you doubt that, catch him in Treasure of Sierra Madre (his best, in my opinion) or African Queen. The best example I can think of as to why these actors from yesteryear were called Stars.
