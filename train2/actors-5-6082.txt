A very convincing actor, who doesn't need to rely on commercial movies to be appreciated (OK OK, so there was Mystery Men, but I don't know of anyone who much appreciate that). Wonderful in Shakespeare in Love . and smashing in Quills . He's diverse and eclectic, and that makes for one hell of an interesting actor!
