By far one of the BEST actors ever. Indiana Jones, Han Solo, guy who surived six days and seven nights on an island with a lesbian! Such a good actor I can't explain his greatness on this screen. But if you haven't seen a Harrison movie, I suggest you get out from under that rock and rent the Indy trilogy.
