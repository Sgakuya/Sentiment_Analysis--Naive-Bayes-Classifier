Over the weekend my Gevalia CM500 coffeemaker caught on fire. The front of the unit always was warm from day one. If I was not present I would bet my house would of been on fire as well. Gevalia asked if I wanted to replace it, but I am now willing to spend over $100 for one that will not catch fire.
