During the mid 80s to mid 90s Dean Koontz had a slew of excellent novels published and Watchers was one that helped catapult him into the limelight. A conspiracy is afoot involving the intentional mutating of genetic tissue and thinks have gotten out of control. Our heroes try to reverse the problem before it's too late. Koontz writes the most furious page turners I've ever read. For one reason or another, Koontz's writing style burns itself into my vision and makes me read his books two-three times as fast as most other authors. He builds up suspense and throws twists and turns at readers like a cross between Robert Ludlum and Stephen King. Koontz is generally regarded as a horror writer but keeps the gore on a tight leash. Rarely does he use violence gratuitously. Watchers is one of his best during his golden era of the late 80s.
