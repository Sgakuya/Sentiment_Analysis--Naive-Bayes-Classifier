I'm gonna go ahead and rate her a 5 just cause there is noone else like her. Now (to change the subject for a moment), I was just at a message board nitpicking the Lord of the Rings movie cause I'm a big fan of the book. Anyway, I was trying to explain why I'm not crazy about Liv Tyler, especially playing the role of Arwen. Which bring me back to the subject because I was trying to think of dark-haired actresses I like that could fit the part. And I remembered Julianna in Mists of Avalon and thought she would've been perfect! She has a toughness without being masculine - it's all in her strong and admirable attitude. And she has such a unique look! She's a different kind of beauty and she's not bone-thin!
