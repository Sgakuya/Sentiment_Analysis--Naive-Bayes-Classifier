I can't believe Spencer Tracy isn't somewhere at the top of this list. Not only was he one of THE greatest actors of the last century, but he also inspired so many others in his craft. His range went easily from drama to light comedy all of which he did with the subtle touch of an unpretentious genius. If you've never seen any of his films, do not continue to live in ignorance - go to imdb.com, get a complete list of his films and head for your video store immediately!
