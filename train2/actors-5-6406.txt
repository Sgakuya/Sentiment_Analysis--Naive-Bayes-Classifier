I just want to say that I think Joshua Jackson is an excellent actor and overall person. And I'm not just saying this about his acting. He seems to be a very down to earth person. He hasn't gotten into all of this Hollywood hype that most young actors fall into. And I congratulate him on that. He also proves that he is not just another pretty face he is a very intelligent person someone you can sit down with and have an actual conversation with. He is someone that all young actors that are just starting out should look up to and I just want to tell him to keep up the good work.
