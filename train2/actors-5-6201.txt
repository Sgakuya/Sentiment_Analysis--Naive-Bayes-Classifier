Gabriel Byrne is extremely talented, versatile, very, very handsome, sexy and just plain fascinating. He is a wonderful writer, has produced some extraordinary films, and is a gifted actor. His portrayal of D'Artagnan in Man in the Iron Mask was, as Roger Ebert said: charismatic and convincing. I think he brings that same charisma to his movies, theatre roles and now to his television show, Madigan Men.
