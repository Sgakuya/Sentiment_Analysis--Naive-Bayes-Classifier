There are women who are thin naturally. I eat whatever I want, but I work out, therefore I stay thin. I don't gain weight, and it has nothing to do with dieting or an eating disorder. I believe Sarah Jessica is the same way. She works out, so she stays thin. There is nothing wrong with that. She is an incredibally talented actress (and singer), and I have great respect for her. Keep doin your thing girl!
