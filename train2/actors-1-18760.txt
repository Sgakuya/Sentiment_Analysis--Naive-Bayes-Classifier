Dreadful, derivative director of dreadful, derivative, tasteless, noisy and not-too-scary thrillers. Mission Impossible was a crappy retread of a crappy TV series: any director who would undertake such a suspect enterprise has to be a hack. Carrie was such an over-the-top and totally absurd concept (like most of the works of that really lame Stephen King) that the only saving grace of the film was all the nubile skin you got to see in the lockerroom scenes. Scarface was one of the worst remakes ever, starring one of the worst actors ever to appear on screen, that sawed-off, loud and filthy mouthed A. Pacino (yecch!!!). Blow Out was cinematic toilet paper. Dressed to Kill was about as suspenseful as reading the Yellow Pages. I would consider this guy to be the worst of the directors currently working, but considering how crappy so many of these dolts are, it's hard to put such sub-mediocrity into perspective.
