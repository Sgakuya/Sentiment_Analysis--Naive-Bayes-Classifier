Would someone explain why this virtually unknown child actress is rated number one? Is her family filing numerous high ratings for her? She has no fans on her IMDb site, no mention in the exhaustive Childstarlets website, and no entries in a Google search. Her ranking here is entirely inappropriate if not fraudulent. {I am ranking her a one star, though I've never seen her in anything nor do I know anyone who has. But since a rating is required I am giving her one.}
