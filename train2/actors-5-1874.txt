Johnny Depp is perhaps the most gifted and talented actor of the time. He doesn't try to be the show off type of celebrity who has to be the center of attention. All of his work is outstanding. He makes all of his characters come to life and although the movie may be a flop, his acting isn't. He had an excellent performance in Pirates of the Caribbean. as Captain Jack Sparrow; I can't wait for the sequel.
