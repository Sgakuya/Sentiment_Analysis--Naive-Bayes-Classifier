It was a great book. I liked the fact that it was darker than the two other books and I loved the tension that existed between Ron and Hermione. I thought that Wood's obsession with Quidditch finally reached a point that it was too much for him. I liked the plot with Sirius Black and the whole surprise at the end of the book. I completely recommend this book.
