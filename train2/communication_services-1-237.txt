I tried to get some answers to questions about the service I signed up for, and after being on hold for over 15 minutes, I got to talk to the most unpleasant woman, whose command of the English language was bordering on non existant. She began interuppting me and I asked to speak to a supervisor. When the supervisor eventually came on the phone after being on hold foe another 10 minutes, he was just as abusive. He told me if I don't like the service I'm getting with Verizon, then tough ! I asked for his name and employee number, and he disconnected me. The salespeople are really nice because they get a comission, but just remember that you only deal with them once! yOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE OTHER IGNORANT PIGS FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR CONTRACT! Go elsewhere. Run, while you still have a chance.!!!!!
