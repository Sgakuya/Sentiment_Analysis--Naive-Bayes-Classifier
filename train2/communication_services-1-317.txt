I have had the same problems with Bell Mobility except they answer my e-mails.I asked about cancelling my contract and going prepaid with the same phone as my needs have changed.I was told it would cost $299 and $45 to go prepaid.I then questioned the amount of cancellation as I only had 2yrs left on the contract and they informed me it couldnt be pro-rated.How is it okay to break a contract when you change your phone like I did in 2004 because the reception was terrible and they wouldnt change it otherwise.They do not honour their contract and their billing was all screwed up and they were charging huge bills at a time.When they were questioned about this they were rude.I would have paid a minimal cancellation fee but not that amount as I am a senior on a fixed income.I have dealt with 2 girls recently and they were helpful but I guess it is Bells policies they have to follow.
