I adore Bette Midler!! I truly believe anyone who says that she doesn't have talent is seriously disturbed! She is not just an amazing entertainer but she a kind, generous person. Just because she doesn't look like some anerxic model doesn't mean she isn't beautiful!! She puts on a damn good show and she cares about others. Bette is a true singer/actress. She doesn't have to dress like a 'Ho' to win over her fans. She's a divine diva... and you can BETTE me on that!
