Way too weird, it's a nice city as far as architecture and scenery, but the people are just out of it, you can't tell the gender of most of them, and they seem to live under ground or something. Because most of the people are like that, they aren't very friendly, they aren't all necessarily mean, but they are like i said, a little out of it. i know that statisticaly, it literaly is the gayest city per capita in america, and that deffinetly shows when you visit. And visiting is all i would ever want to do, and after doing so, i dont think i will again.
