A great actress. She was so good in the Coal Miners Daughter. Loretta Lynn hand picked Sissy do play her in this movie boy did she make a good choice! She got a well deserved Oscar for this role. I also thought she was a hoot in A Blast From the Past.as the 60s mom raising her son in an bomb shelter. so funny. I also liked her in the recent tv movie Midwives.She makes every role believable.
