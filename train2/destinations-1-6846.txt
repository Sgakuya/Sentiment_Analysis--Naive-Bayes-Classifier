I live about 80 miles from the North Dakota border, and I really can't say I'm too impressed with this state. Fargo is nothing special, it's even colder, flatter, and even more boring than South Dakota (how is it possible?). Minnesota's right next door, it has all the coldness and flatness of the Dakotas but has much more to offer. The only good thing about North Dakota that I can think of offhand is that Devil's Lake is about as good as it gets for fishing in the U.S.
