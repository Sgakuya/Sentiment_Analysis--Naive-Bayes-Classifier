Upsetting and amazing. After reading a bunch of books about WW2, I realized that most of the information we get downplays the pivotal role the Russians played in winning the war. The vast bulk of the fighting in WW2 involved operation Barbarossa - Germany's invasion of Russia. This book gives you an overview of that brutal conflict, with a detailed account of the almost unimaginably hellish fighting in and around Stalingrad from late 1942 to early 1943. If you're ever feeling like your life is rough, read this book and imagine what it would have been like to be a soldier - on either side - at Stalingrad.
