Progressive and their phone reps are a bunch of liars!!!!! I had my car boken into 4 years ago and at the time I had no glass coverage on my car. After this I called progressive and asked to have glass coverage added to my policy. Their rep told me that in order to do this I needed to change my deductible from $500 to $250. At the time I was so mad at the entire situation I agreed...stupid me. Fast forward 4 years and my car, 1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport, gets broken into again, a half an hour ago to be exact. (Aparently the crackhead really wanted the $1.25 in change I had in my ashtray.) I called Progressive just to verify that I had glass coverage and low and behold I don't...but I've been paying more for my policy the past 4 years because of the $250 deductible versus the $500 I previously had. I will be changing insurance companies tomorrow because PROGESSIVE EMPLOYEES ARE ALL LIARS AND MISLEAD THEIR CUSTOMERS.
