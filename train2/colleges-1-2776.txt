When I think of our cadet's experience -- nightmare might be the more appropriate word -- I think, of that old saying, Looks can be deceiving. It truly applies here. We found ourselves angered on various levels -- as parents, as taxpayers, as consumers, etc. I would have to encourage anyone, before you take your child to VMI, educate yourself on what the various definitions of hazing are. Start with Stophazing.org. Visit your Public Library. Then ask yourself: Is this really where I want my son or daughter educated?
