I have been a Tom Hanks fan ever since Bosom Buddies. He is such a versatile actor. He has the comedic timing of the best comedy actors, and the compassion and sincerity to play the most dramatic and complex role. He was entertaining as the 12 year old boy trapped in a man's body in Big. So convincing in everything he does, he WAS Forrest Gump, the prison guard in Green Mile, the sergeant in Saving Private Ryan. .you never have to stretch your imagination when he is on the screen..he IS the part. On a personal level (no, I am not buddy buddy with Tom..but through interviews and the causes he supports) he seems like a very down to earth, compassionate man. Many people get sick of celebrities spouting off their political views and causes..I recently heard Tom as the spokesman for a WW2 Memorial. What a worthwhile cause to lend his support to. He seems like an honorable man and is the BEST actor of our time.
