One thing I don't like about many books are poor endings that seem to have no (I hate this word) closure. Not the case with the Red Tent. I found the entire book enthralling and was quite pleased to find the ending leaving me satisfied and eager to read it again. Like Water for Chocolate and Love in the Time of Cholera are other books with simmilar strong endings, and the only other novels beside the Red Tent that I have reread. The writing is superb, although what I think drew me in the most was the retelling of familiar stories from the Bible. I studied biblical history in college and really miss it so I think reading this book brought home a sense of nostalgia. It's also a wonderful way to look at Biblical characters from a different, female angle. Some have attacked the paganistic elements of the book, citing that the wives and daughters of Jacob would never engage in pagan practices but one must remember that this is a book of fiction. Also, Judaism was in its infancy and Christianity still several centuries off. It is probably more accurate to portray characters who still clung to long held pagan rituals as that is probably how things really happened. Indeed there are accounts in the Bible of pagan practices persisting long after Jacob- the golden calf (a manifestation of the Caananite god Baal) and King Ahab's wife Jezebel being two examples. Religious elements aside, this is just a good book with strong female characters and a haunting sense of history. I look forward to sharing this with my daughters when they are older.
