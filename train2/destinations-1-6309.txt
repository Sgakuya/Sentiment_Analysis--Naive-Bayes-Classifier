You could fall asleep upon entering Ohio from the Pennsylvania side and awaken when you enter Indiana and never miss a thing, that's how utterly bland it is. A bowl of cream of wheat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day for a year would be more exciting. The suburbs of Columbus are the drabbest and most uninspiring I've ever seen, with the possible exception of those surrounding Baltimore. If you've ever seen the Drew Carey show, that's a perfect caricature of this worthless place. But if you like cheap beer and polish sausage you'll be happy here.
