I bought my 05 last year. Every ride I go on......It spends another week in the shop ! Blown head gasket, leaky valve cover, leaky exhaust, wiring harness x 3, 4 wheel locking mechanism, front diff, both ball joints ($880.00 per side), tie rods x 3, tie rod ends, poor quality foot boards - replaced 2, 4x4 and speedo quit 3 times.............................the list goes on and on all in 1 year ! JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK. I owned a polaris, and even it was better ! I have had a Honda, and It was the best machine I have ever owned....just a little slow for me. I hope this helped YOU !
