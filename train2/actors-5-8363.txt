The answer to one question can sum up the depth and longevity of her talent and appeal - If Shirley Temple had gotten the role of Dorothy, would we all still be watching The Wizard of Oz with such child-like glee well into adulthood? Not to slight the film, the other great actors in it, all the great technical aspects or the wonderful classic fantasy, but Judy Garland made this film what it was in so many ways. Somewhere Over the Rainbow will always be hers and it will always pull on the heartstrings - as will this talented soulful performer.
