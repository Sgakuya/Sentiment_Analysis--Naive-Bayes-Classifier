When fairly judging A W cream soda, I find it disgusting. I find it hard to believe the amazing A W company, with it's signature Root Beer, can not put forth a better effort in this area. The cream soda is much too carbonated, and has a flavor like a fermented cola. I do not enjoy drinking this soda.
