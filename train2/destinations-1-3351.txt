The people in this city are incredibly rude! They don't smile or talk to strangers. Even my neighbors barely acknowledge me! Most of them are lawyers or bureacrats - specimens not known for creativity or social graces. Then there is the population "on the other side of the tracks". Most of whom are black with little education. They live in slums right in the shadow of the capitol. The only advantage is a nice metro system and some huge museums with unimpressive art to take your guests from middle America to.
