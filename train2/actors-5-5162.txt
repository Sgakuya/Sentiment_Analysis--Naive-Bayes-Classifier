I am 29 years old and Australian. I have been livig in London for 6 years now and get very very homesick. I first saw Heath in 10 things and was blown away. Last Christmas I was given Patriot on DVD and fell head over heals. Then I heard about Two Hands from my cousin Kate in Melbourne and went straight to the video shop. He is an amazing actor. When ever I am homesick I watch Two Hands. I am pretty sure this guy will go far. He is very talented and a good looking man. Good on him. My grandmother used to go to school with his grandmother. She said everyone used to be inlove with his grandfather as well. Maybe Heath got his looks from him. Anyway, Heath if you are reading this, keep it up. Don't get involved in the HOLLYWOOD crap either. Stay Aussie. Saty real.
