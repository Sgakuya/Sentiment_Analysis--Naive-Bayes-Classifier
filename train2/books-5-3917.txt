This is an incredible book. It is a journey through the life and times of the Buend a family. This was revolutionary in setting forth the path for the realismo magico (magical realism) genre that has followed. There is extreme symbolism, both in the names of the characters and in the events that occur. I read it in it's original Spanish before in Enlgish, I reccomend it either way. It is a must-read.
