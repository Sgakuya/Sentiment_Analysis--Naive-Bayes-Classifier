I've watched just about every movie Mr Gere has made. I've never called myself a fan, but I've always recognized his talent. And then came Mr. Jones. I am bipolar, and I just wanted to say that he hit it so on the nose that I cried and laughed and cried. It's a complicated disorder that's difficult to understand, and he made it come alive for people living with it and for those that don't have to. My commendations on a job well done.
