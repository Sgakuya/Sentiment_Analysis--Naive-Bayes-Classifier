*rent is outrageous *road conditions are at third world standards *unions run the show here, which is one of the reasons why everything seems to be under construction all year-round (workers can walk off the job when they please and not get fired) *John F Kennedy International Airport is an embarassment. It is probably the most confusing, under-developed airport of any major city *it is extremely segregated racially and culturally *the work environment in the metro area is tense and brutally competitive *don't expect people to come to your aid if you're getting attacked (unless you happen to be a hot chick) *despite the recent changes, the public school system is pathetic *somebody here pointed out the radio stations suck -- I second that!! *the accent is annoying This is all coming from a native!
