Alison Sweeeny Rocks! she is the BEST soap actress I have ever had the pleasure of watching on screen and not only is she talented in the acting department, she is also kind to her fans and talks with us on her message board whenever she gets a chance. BTW:Sami and Lucas belong together finally! They got loads of chemistry together. So as soon as she dumps this loser guy she is with (Brandon)I hope Sami and Lucas can FINALLY be together after their 10 years together on Days. Bryan Dattilo rocks too! I love him and Alison! Go Lumi!
