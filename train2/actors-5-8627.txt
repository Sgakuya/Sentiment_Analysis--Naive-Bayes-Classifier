Oh my God, what a magnificent specimen of woman! I just finished watching Bhowani Junction ( for the third time) and I can hardly believe that such a beautiful woman could have existed. Not only was she a great screen presence, she was a hell of a character in real life. Independent and intelligent, she stood out in an era where the ideal woman was the good little housewife. There will never be another like her.
