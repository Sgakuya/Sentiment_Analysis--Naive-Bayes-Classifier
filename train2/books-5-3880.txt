A great book. Generally the ignorant and illiterate attempt to have it removed from school libraries and reading lists--sometimes for the n word but just as often for, shall we say, Twain's less-than-reverent attitude towards Christianity. (Don't miss the hilarious part on the theological problem of preforeordestination. ) Those who don't like the n word (if they are able to read at all) should read the moving scene with Huck and Jim on the river, where Huck has this moral crisis: Huck knows that he should do the right thing and turn Jim in, for he is an escaped slave; but since he loves and is devoted to his friend Jim, he decides he would rather do the wrong thing and go to Hell, rather than abandon his friend. Huck Finn is one of the best novels ever written in America. Five glowing stars.
