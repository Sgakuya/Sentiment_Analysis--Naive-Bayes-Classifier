She does a good job as the typical young, spoiled soap witch. She has such a cute, angelic face that the contrast in her character really seems to work for her. At least she still makes me want to slap her. I noticed she finally got that jock-dumb Austin to fall for her so, of course, now she wants someone else. Aaargh! I have no idea why I watch soaps!
