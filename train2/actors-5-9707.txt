She is a phenominal actress in every sense. Her versatility alone is reason to love her! The difference between the title character in Elizabeth and Connie in Pushing Tin is astonishing! And yet she did both to perfection! She took an incidental character like Merideth Logue in The Talented Mr. Ripley and turned her into a complete character that people could care about. But aside from her acting, she has also (through interviews, etc) proven herself to be really intelligent and down to earth! I adore her and her work!
