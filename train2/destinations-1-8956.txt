I just purchased a can of Husky L/C Straight and it tastes horrible! I was always a Copenhagen fan until the prices went sky high. I switched to Kayak L/C Staight last year and liked it a lot. There was a promotion on an online retailer for $1.75/5 can roll at the time and I bought as much as I could. It now sells for $7.25/5 can roll so I figured I would try Husky at $4.75/5 can roll. Man am I glad I bought only 1 tin at a local market to try it out because I would have been stuck with a lot of this junk. I'm either going to stick with the Kayak and pay a little more or go with Grizzly, Longhorn, or Timberwolf which are just as good as the Kayak but a bit cheaper. It is a shame that USTC put out such a lousy product in order to compete with the other generic brands.
