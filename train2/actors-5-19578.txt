I never really noticed Tom Sizemore until I got totally hooked on Robbery Homicide Division. This was the best cop show on TV in a long time. I haven't watched CBS since they cancelled RHD and don't plan to. I have sinced discovered that I have many Tom Sizemore mivies in my cupboard and enjoy everyone of them. He is such an in depth actor that he mesmerizes you right from the start. He puts so much of himself in every role he plays and would like to thank him for all the great movies he's been in and especially for RHD. Thank you
