What a great talent . It is tragic she had to die so young. She had a wonderful singing voice.and she was a good actress as well. I think hollywood ignored her at oscar time. She should have at least won for A star is Born. She was great in Meet Me in St. Louis. and I cannot imagine anyone else playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
