Not even in the Top-100 B-schools, Wharton is here because its students have only one thing to do - spam the website. A good-for-nothing school with an education system that sucks. Its students go about claiming that all other scools are dud theirs is the best without conducting any research. It'd be better if its students stop spamming on this site just to make fool of themselves.
