First of all, I don t know squat about the hit-and-run story, and I couldn t care less about Halle Berry s relationship with David Justice. Here s what I do know: she s really, really good looking. And as a bonus she s not a terrible actress. Disclaimer: I never saw The Flintstones. But I did see Bulworth and Boomerang, and I couldn t take my eyes off her in either movie. Did I mention that I think she s good-looking?
