With its omnipresent sense of familial love, emphasis on the vivid imagination of childhood and lament at the often stifling nature of daily routine Calvin and Hobbes is an almost quintessentially romantic comic strip. It brings back fond memories of childhood for me amongst the reams of subtly intelligent humor to an immensely enjoyable effect.
