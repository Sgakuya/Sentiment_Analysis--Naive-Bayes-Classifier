Well what can be said about Angelina Jolie... Except for that she is the best actress that I have seen in a long time... Whomever rated her, or even rates her, below a 5 they are crazy... Jolie is not one of the first actresses that I have seen that are not fake and do not do it for the publicity and the fame!!! She brings a sort of glamour and shine to the big screen, and I really admire her being open to her fans and not holding anything back... When you listen to a lot of famous ppl they tend to keep things from the readers because they are afraid of what they will think of them... Jolie does not do that.... She expresses herself through her films!!! I believe that she is the best actresses and I love her!!! I am Jolie's #1 fan! Girl Interrupted was the best movie that she has starred in yet... But there are more to come!!! 'danielle'
