Impressive all around. Solid performances in Fight Club and The Wings of the Dove. A less-known must still equally compelling performance as Marina Oswald in the TV film Fatal Deception: Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. The fact that she delivered a terrific performance dressed as an ape in Planet of the Apes (2001) is a testament to her enormous acting talent. Very talented and beautiful.
