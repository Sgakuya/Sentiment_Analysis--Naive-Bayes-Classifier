this thing is an overpriced POS!!!! for the money id rather buy a buy 3 civics turbo charge all three and drive circles around this slow, weak performing car.....anyone who owns an NSX has way too much money to spend..everyone else who wants one...probably thought it was a ferrari from the front.....ps the back is hideous..
