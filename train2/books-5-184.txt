I read nothing but true crime and when I read the back of this book, I was intrigued. I read both of his books and I am amazed at the way he turned his life around and all that he lived through. he is a VERY strong man and I commend him. Very great reading.It also makes you think twice when you spank your kid. Wonderful Man!
