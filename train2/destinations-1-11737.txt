Five friends and I drove there from Buffalo and by the time we left, all of our drugs and alcohol were stolen by crackheads, our wallets were stolen, we got screwed over by a travel agency, my buddy got kidnapped by a drug dealer, there was only a couple cool clubs, and finally my buddies 99' cherokee classic was stolen and crashed by locals which made it on CNN. DO NOT GO THERE....you wil regreat it.. and if you think this story is fake then your wrong because we got it on video. LATEEEEE...
