I think that Audrey Hepburn was one of the greatest actresses who ever lived. She worked her way up to the top starting with nothing. She was a positive influence on so many people, she made great movies, and she dedicated the last years of her life to traveling with UNICEF to help the children in the Third World Countries. She is my favorite actress--I just wish that I could have met her before she passed away in 1993 (This site says 1989). I've never heard someone say something negative about her, and if they did something is wrong with them. Thank you for reading my comment about Audrey Hepburn.
