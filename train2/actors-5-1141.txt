Tom Hanks is a talented and versatile actor. From his early days dressing in drag on that silly sitcom Busom Buddies to his wonderfully emoted scenes of angst in Castaway, Hanks has always put in sincere effort from his gut, while developing and improving his acting ability along the way. Many have enjoyed his brilliance in Forrest Gump and Phillidelphia as well as the romantic comedy You've Got Mail, but for something different check him out in Punchline, with Sally Field. The script could've used a little work, but he really got to me in his role as a med-student turned aspiring stand-up comic.
