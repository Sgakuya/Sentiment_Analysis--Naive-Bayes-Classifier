Not to be a copy cat- I would tend to agree with madvillany- this state for the most part seems depressed, with rude people (especially to anyone who looks 'strange or different') No matter the economy sucks- the populace seems unable to make the needed social and behavioral attitudes to promote changes to allow fresh air and new ideas in. Very conservative politically-to the point of as said below 'reactionary'. Indianapolis is one faint ray of hope- the rest is a large step backward.
