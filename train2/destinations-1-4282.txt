I have lived in Richmond most of my life, but it is time to go. At one time this city had the potential to be unique; merging the old and the new, but that was in the 70's. Since then, urban sprawl, destruction of old buildings, failed mass transit, high crime and under it all they are still fighting the civil war. Black and white for the most part don't interact; hispanics are viewed with outright hatred; orientals as if they were from another planet. There are a few nice neighborhoods and museums, but a weekend is enough. But this is not unique to Richmond; it is true for many, not all, parts of Virginia.
