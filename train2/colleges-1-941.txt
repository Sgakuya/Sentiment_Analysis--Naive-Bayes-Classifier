This College was paid $2 million dollars by Household International, a predatory lender, to add a website that encourages debt among service members, and seems to disregard the Soldiers and Sailors Act which provides temporary relief to active duty service members. Household's parent HSBC is linked to a bank owned by the former-regime of Saddam Hussein. The bank relationship is being investigated for money laundering. UMUC seems to have disregarded this information, took the $2 million, and turned the other way. It is unconscionable that UMUC is supposed to provide higher education to military personnel and, at the same time, is in partnership with a predatory lender that often mishandles payments, records, and disregards the law. UMUC should be blacklisted from US installations and banned from taxayer contracts handed out by the Department of Defense and the US Army, until it ceases its relationship with Household International. It looks again like UMUC will do anything for money, even profiteering off soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
