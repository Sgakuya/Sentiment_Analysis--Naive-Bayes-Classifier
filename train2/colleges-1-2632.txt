I enrolled in six graduate courses which were supposedly advanced. Three of the six were all but identical of my sophomore and freshman college courses with the SAME textbooks! Two others were fresh material but presented at an undergraduate level. The last course was the only one worthy of graduate level study. Yes, I transferred out to a school for adults.
