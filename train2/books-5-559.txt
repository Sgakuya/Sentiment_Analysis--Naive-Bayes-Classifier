I've always felt that the off the wall humor of Dr. Suess either inspired in some way or at least foreshadowed the more biting comedy that began to appear in the later in the '60's and '70's. You can't deny that more than a few of us Baby Boomers cut our satirical teeth on stories like The Cat in the Hat . The cat was rude, destructive, and fairly rebellious - and we loved it. I don't mean to say these stories were not wholesome - I personally love them and still do. It's just that occasionally, just underneath the lilt of the rhyme, the humor had a slight edge to it.
