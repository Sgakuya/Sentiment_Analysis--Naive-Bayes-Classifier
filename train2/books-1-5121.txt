Boring, whiny book written by a boring, whiny man. If you need a good example of a human being so utterly spineless it almost takes on comic proportions, read this book. Yet I'll give credit where credit is due, all of us know that guy - the guy who is constantly being taken advantage of by the women in his life and who always goes running back to them.
