I've only seen Lifeboat, but I want to see more of her. Her quotes are outrageous, such as If I had to live my life again, I'd make the same mistakes, only sooner and I have three phobias which, could I mute them, would make my life as slick as a sonnet, but as dull as ditch water: I hate to go to bed, I hate to get up, and I hate to be alone.
