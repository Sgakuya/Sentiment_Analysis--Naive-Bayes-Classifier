I am a strong, independent, reasonably fearless, grown woman. IT is the only book I've ever had to put down because I got scared. I was reading IT one night while my husband was at work. To this day we laugh about the fact that I put it face down on the floor, left the room, and turned on every light in the house. Didn't sleep a wink that night. IT's that good.
