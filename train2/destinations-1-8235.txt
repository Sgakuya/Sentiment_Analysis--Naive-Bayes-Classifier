Endangered Animals are not meant to be locked up in cages where they sit and sleep in their own shit, urine, vomit, and lice. They are also not meant to be trained to dance in costumes for little kids. White lions and white Siberian tigers are endangered. Don't limit their numbers. Not to mention that the tigers were being whipped in order to be trained. No wonder why Roy got chomped.
