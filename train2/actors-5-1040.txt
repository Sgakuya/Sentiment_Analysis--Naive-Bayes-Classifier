I'm sorry but I don't know how any actor could rank over Tom Hanks. He is one of America's most beloved actors and desereves the title he holds unarguably. He is magnificent at every genre, creating characters we love almost as much as him. No to mention, he is the epitome of an American man-he works hard, loves his wife and family and is just an all-around good guy.
