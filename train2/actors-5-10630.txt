Drew, Drew, Drew. I can not say enough. I am the same age as Drew, 25 I have grown up watching her on TV. I am so proud of what she has accomplished. I loved Never been Kissed and I'm sure Charlies Angles will rock! I admire her because even when she was down and out she never gave up. Thank you Drew for staying a role model and keeping the faith and letting us continue to enjoy seeing you on the big screen. You are wonderful and my favorite.
