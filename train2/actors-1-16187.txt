Make that 70 ratings in one day for this guy. Yet another fan club has found RIA and decided to stink the place up. Sad really. All of that effort and the guy STILL isn't ranked #1. He isn't even close to making #1. Of course that is because the #1 ranked Stephen Nicols fan club found RIA first. Hehe. I assume this guys arch nemesis on General Hospital is played by Ted King. Those same pathetic fans did at least manage to 1 star that guy all the way to the bottom of the list.
