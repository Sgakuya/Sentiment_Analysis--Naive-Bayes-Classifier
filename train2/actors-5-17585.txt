Hillary B. Smith is One Life TO LiVe! She lives and breathes her character of Nora! I got hooked on OLTL soley because of her and when she and bo broke up I was heartbroken! I sorta stoped watching for a bit but tune every so often nowadays to check in on her and hope that her and bo get back together! I think she is superb and shows real emotion!
