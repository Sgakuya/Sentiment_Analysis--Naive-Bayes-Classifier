I grew up watching Elijah and I now recognize that he has outgrown his teenybopper fame. He is a talented actor that deserves to be judged on the hard work he has created since a child. For instance, he has brought Frodo to life in a way no one else could. He's wonderful and i hope to see him in projects worthy of him.
