Boring, I hope she never hosts another Acadamy Awards show in her life. In fact I would'nt mind if her show was cancelled tommorow. She really pushed my buttons when she insisted on coming out as a lesbian on her show, like she was trying to prove something. The only thing she wound up proving was how easy it is to lose a show when you insist on pushing your sexual preference on your show. I have nothing against lesbians, I just find Ellen unfunny and unattractive. There are a million other people who are more deserving of there own show. Oh yea, I'm glad Ann Hesche dumped her, she is too hot to be on Ellens arm.
