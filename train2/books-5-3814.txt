Joseph Heller acts as an excited but confused tour guide, leading the reader through the hilariously ironic world of bomber pilots in World War 2. With an incredible eye for satire, Heller wrote this novel that made me laugh so hard I cried, over and over again. Imagine a G.I. Dilbert comic, non stop for the length of this classic novel, introducing over 15 memorable characters.
