Ed O'Neill is the best comedien ever!!! He played the role of Al Bundy in Married with Children awesome. His facial expressions are hilarious, and he has turned that show into a classic. Way to go Ed. He has also done a good job in Dragnet, playing the detective. Overall, a great actor in every aspect!
