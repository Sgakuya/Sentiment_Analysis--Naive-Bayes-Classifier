This stuff is poison. It claims to be "all-natural" and healthy but its actually one of the worst things you could do to your body. Out of all the brands out there, B its loaded with sugar and fat. Even worse is the company, which sells a false image of being a small, hippie-owned, environmentally friendly organization. Bunch of bull!! They're as big and gready a corporation as they come. They were forced to remove the "all natural" tag from their ice-cream because it was a fraudulent claim. On many occasions they paid fines for violating sewage disposal guidelines, their fortune 500 enterprise is a huge monstrocity that spews tons of this poison, makes many CEOs filty rich and happy, makes false claims about environmental activism, and fights unions. UGH!! Makes me sick. Do you body (and your conscience) a favor and stay away from this stuff!!
