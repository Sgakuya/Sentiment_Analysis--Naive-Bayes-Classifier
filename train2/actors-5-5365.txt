A very talented and underrated actor who can portray a variety of roles very convincingly and with great depth. Frequency was a great movie, so was DOA but in my opinion Saviour is his best. It is a really harrowing, moving story and Dennis played the lead role so well, a man whose life was ruined, who is battling again guilt and anger, struggling to keep his humanity in the midst of one of the most awful wars of today. One of the powerful movies ever made, and he carried it.
