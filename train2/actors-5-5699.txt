An actor of understated performances yet affecting characters. He earned great reviews for playing Peter Parker in Spider-Man, being a revelation to many who may have only seen him in The Cider House Rules or Pleasantville previously. Seabiscuit continued his foray into tackling physically demanding performances, as he humanized the role of a down-on-his-luck jockey. Wonder Boys is another resume highlight, which further shows his good fortune of attaching himself to critically-favored films. Quite a respectable film career, thus far.
