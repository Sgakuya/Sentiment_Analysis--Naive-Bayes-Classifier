By the far the most handsome man God ever created for Hollywood. Cary Grant's appeal was that he was an everyman, but he had a sense of humor and charm. Plus that accent helps a bit too. He is hysterical in Arsenic and Old Lace, one of the funniest movies of all time. The comedy isn't forced, it is very natural. He is equally as charming in Father Goose, The Philadelphia Story, and Bringing Up Baby. In some of his dramas such as North by Northwest, Notorious, and Nothing But the Lonely Heart to name just a few he is equally as appealing still adding a bit of humor.
