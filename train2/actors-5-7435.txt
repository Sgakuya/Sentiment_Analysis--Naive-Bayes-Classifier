I just don't get you people. Keanu Reeves is above Rambo? What is the world coming to when such a person who is better portrayed by Spider-Man on Saturday Night Live than he actually is himself is higher than Rocky? Stallone is one of the greatest actors of our time....an action heroe,...a drama star....a writer too.
