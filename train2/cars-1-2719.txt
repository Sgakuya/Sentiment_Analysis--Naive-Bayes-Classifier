This thing isn't a sports car, its a joke. 180hp!? Do you realize how expensive this is? If I'm going to pay $35,000 for a sports car it better have more than 180hp! Not mention it really doesn't handle well at all. People who like this car (and can't BS anyone with claims of good acclereation with only 180hp) because of Audi's yuppy image make up claims of great handling because this car really has nothing to offer. This Beetle-looking thing is just a major waste of money.
