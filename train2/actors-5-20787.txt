Ok, first of all, I think everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I believe that everyone using this website would agree to that, or else you wouldn't be here. So, why exactly do some of you feel as though Sarah should keep her political opinions to herself? I believe it is honorable that Ms. Parker uses her celebrity to promote political discussion. While other celebrities are out wasting their lives away, Ms. Parker has been using her fame to aid the less fortunate through UNICEF and other organizations. I live in Athens County, Ohio, where Ms. Parker was born, and I, like Sarah, know what it is like to live in one of the most impoverished areas of our country. Why ridicule a woman whose primary interest is in promoting the wellbeing of the less fortunate? Methinks we should only wish other celebrities had a heart like Sarah...
