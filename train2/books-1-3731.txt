I read this book in grade 10 English. I never ever want to read it again. One of things I didn't like was the author new a little bit more then she should have for a 6 year old. I think it is a really boring book. We were supposed to finish it and do a book report on it. I never finished it. I don't think I really got past chapter 10. It was so boring. There was absolutely no plot to the book and I just thought it was really boring.
