Every female actress that has came along since Demi Moore should thank her. She did have a bad roll in Strip Tease , but I think she proved herself differently with G.I. Jane . That is one of my all time favorite movies. She played a roll that accomplished something that I think most women would want to accomplish. I know I would. She is also a very beautiful woman and I give her lots of credit for her unbelieveable body. After three kids, most women dont even look as close to that wonderful. I bow to her!!!
