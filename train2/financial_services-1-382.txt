As a brokerage, mutual fund company and 401K provider, Fidelity has a great array of products and service is very good accross the board. Additionally, their brand is very important to them and you will naver catch them in those embarrassing conflict of interest situations that the other big financial service companies have been caught up in. So as a customer, you could say that I am very pleased with Fidelity. The PROBLEM is that I workf for Fidelity. I hate it so much. Very aggressive - most political corporation that I have ever worked for. Different business units won't work with one another (will pretend to ... but really don't). Constant walking on eggshells ... my senior management swears at and berates his customers ... not appropriate behavior for an Executive VP. I can't wait until the ecomomy improves so I can leave this sole sucking company .... I hat it so much!!!
