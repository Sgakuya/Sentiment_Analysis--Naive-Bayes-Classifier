I've been stationed here since March and I just know it will be the worst three years of my life. The traffic, the weather, the construction, all horrendous. I don't see how this city is the fourth largest in America. I can't wait to leave this armpit of Texas in 2007. Oh yeah, and the radio stations here are terrible.
