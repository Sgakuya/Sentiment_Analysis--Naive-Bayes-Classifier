i loved Judy Blume when i was a kid, so when this book came out, i didn't know what to expect. I picked it up and couldn't put it down! This is a great book for summer reading! or reading any time. The characters are realistic and relatable. Judy Blume for grown up girls is just as good as Judy Blume for young ones!
