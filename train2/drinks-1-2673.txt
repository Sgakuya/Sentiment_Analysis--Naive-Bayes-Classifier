1. I was fully aware of the payment plan and delivery system. 2. The sign-up merchadise was inferior quality and useless. 3. The coffee was good. 4. Shipments were eratic. 5. I cancelled my account, paid for what I had used and returned unopened future shipments. 6. I still get bills for shipments I either rejected or returned. A SAD WAY TO COMPETE FOR OUR BUSINESS!
