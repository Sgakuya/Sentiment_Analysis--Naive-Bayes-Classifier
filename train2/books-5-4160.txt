According to Kundera, there are two broad classes of womanizers in the world - Epic womanizers, who strive to sleep with as many women as humanly possible, and Lyrical womanizers who are in constant search of a female reflection of themselves - and unable to find her, sleep with more and more women. The Unbearable Lightness of Being tells the story of an Epic womanizer, who has slept with thousands of woman, but can only comfortably fall asleep with one. Strangely poignant, this book takes a very honest look at the dynamics that make up relationships between men and women. I strongly recommend it.
