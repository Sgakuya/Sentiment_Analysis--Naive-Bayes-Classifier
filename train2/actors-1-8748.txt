Jennifer Garner tries hard, sometimes, to be a good actress. She can't make up for lack of talent with hard work, though. She has limited abilities and is mediocre in her best moments. While the fact that she is not attractive and has angular mannish features has nothing to do with her acting ability, that fact that her appearance and talent are both sub-par is an unfortunate coincidence.
