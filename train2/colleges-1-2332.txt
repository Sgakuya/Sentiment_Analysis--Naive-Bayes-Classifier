It's Montana. It's got typical Montana stuff like mountains and skiing. However, Bozeman has a college, too, and, in my opinion, is a billion times prettier. The school has a 100% acceptance rate and is located in an ultraconservative state with few towns over 1,000 people. So, you will be sharing classes and the town with xenophobic morons. Not everyone is like that, of course, but enough that they are hard to avoid.
