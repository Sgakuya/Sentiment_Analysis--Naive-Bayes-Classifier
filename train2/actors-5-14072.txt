One of the more attractive women on TV who doesn't need to use her body to be beautiful. Her voice is sexy and soft, and if you've ever heard her CD Healing Angel, which she helped make with Phil Coulter, you'll know what I'm talking about. If I wasn't a married man, and if she wasn't married either. . .Man, she can make me Irish coffee any day!
