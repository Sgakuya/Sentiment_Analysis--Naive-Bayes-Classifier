Great actor, I regard Oldman and Sean Penn as probably the finest actors of their age group. Oldman is an extremely versatile actor who has played everything from Sid Vicious to Dracula to a Hell's Kitchen gangster and more. He always puts forth his best effort, and he is one of the comparatively few actors who cause you to thoroughly suspend any notion of disbelief and nearly forget that there is actually any acting going on at all. Incredible talent.
