Among poor gas mileage are underpowered and rust susceptible within the first year. I don't even think the new Xterra's are made in Japan but maybe Mexico, or at least that's what I've been told. Did I mention the engine was made by Ford? Remember the commerical ROCK SOLID well I personally don't want a vehicle that SINKS and this is definitely one that will. Sorry, but I'd prefer one really made in Japan with quality.
