I have recently changed my rating of SprintPCS from a 5 to a 1...now this may sound harsh, but it is deserving. I signed up for Sprint PCS 3 years ago because they had excellent voice quality, great prices, albeit poor coverage. They ALSO did not require you to sign a contract. Now, Sprint PCS is no better than any other provider, in fact they are probably the worst out there. Their coverage sucks...I live in ATLANTA and I can't get one bar of signal in my apartment while all my other friends with cell phones enjoy perfect service. All the things I praised about them before: no contracts, the *4 minute feature, their great support, has now changed. They are a money grubbing company with terrible customer support, and horrible service. There are plenty of better alternatives out there. My phone was stolen and they still charged me a $150 cancellation fee after I'd spent 3 years being a good customer and recommending my friends. That's their appreciation...well, they can just suck my balls...I'm out
