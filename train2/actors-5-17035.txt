NLG is a wonderful talented actress in her portrayal of Alexis Davis. She deserved the emmy last year for lead actress. I Especially enjoyed her storyline last year. She has made the most out of terrible writing this year. She is a gem and GH needs to wake up and smell the coffee and treat her as she deserves to be treated, one of the top lead actresses in daytime.
