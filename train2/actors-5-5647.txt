Eddie Murphy is still a strong actor. I still think that Beverly Hills Cop was his best movie. Same with the Nutty Professor movies. The most recent Daddy Day Care showed that he could be a box office hit again after a few flops. But most top actors have some flops too. Some lame movies like Showtime, Best Defense and some others just didn't work for Eddie. But movies like The Golden Child, Harlem Nights, 48 Hours, Boomerang and others showed his range and diversity. Eddie should look for better scripts so he can get back on top again.
