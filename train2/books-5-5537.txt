A good follow up to Tuesday's With Morrie. Mitch is still one of the elite sports columnists in the nation, no doubt. But watching his work mature over the years, there is no doubt his time with Morrie really DID open his eyes. He is now writing more political and social columns than sports and this book is just his idea on life and living it to its fullest. Is it possible that he merely wrote this as some sort of life-fulfillment project? Perhaps. But anybody can read it and and reflect a bit on personal experience.
