ARE YOU PEOPLE NUTS? Why on earth wasn't Sissy Spacek's name way higher on this list? This woman is a 5-star actress if there ever was one!! And it's not like she's new or anything. Since her outstanding performance in Carrie in the 70's she has been in many movies in many different, and all outstanding roles!! Everyone PLEASE see The Long Walk Home in which she starred with Whoopi Goldberg!!!
