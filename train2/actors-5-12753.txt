I can't say I agreed with the Best Actress Oscar she won for Shakespeare in Love, but I can say she is a good actress. I feel sorry for her in Bounce; in Duets she proved she could sing; in Sydney (Hard Eight) you believed she was a prostitute; and in half of her movies she convinces everyone that she is actually British.
