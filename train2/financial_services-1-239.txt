Bank of America has the worst online banking program. They don't have a reminder when you accidently pay bill amount more than your available balance. This is a big catch to make overdrown fees for them. The pay from bar is so not obvious so you will easily overlook your balance. They design this way that seems to trap human's error for making their overdrawn fees.
