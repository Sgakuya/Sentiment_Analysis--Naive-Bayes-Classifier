Everybody thinks I am weird because I like Matthew Perry! Well they are very weird because they don't. Matthew Perry is an astonishing actor with many talents such as comedy. He makes me laugh when I just heard something sad. In Three To Tango, I couldn't help but laugh because of what he had to do. Some people think, oh he is just one of those everyday, will never be heard from again actors, but that is a lie. It is hard to be blessed with this kind of talent, and so was I. So I look up to him because he is funny, and he is not one of those everyday actors you'll never remember. Of course we'll remember him, he is Chandler Bing, and that is all I have to say. Oh, and if anything happened to him in his life where he could die, I would cry because he is a role model, my role model. Change Matthew, for all of your fans. Don't be a fool, I love you, and so does God.
