I didn't like this book's message, but I should think even the most dedicated right-winger would be offended by this book, because it paints the conservative cause in such a poor light. Olson is a horrible writer, so consumed with hate that she's unable to make a convincing case against Clinton even when one exists -- everything blends into the same rant. It's telling that the author's work has been funded by sketchy characters like Richard Mellon Scaife.
