Imagine a world where everyone stank of piss everywhere. But no where you went you could get away from them. Imagine there were no showers because nobody washed. Imagine a world where they had crappy cars but loud mufflers to show off their crappy cars but yet no where u could go u could get away from it. And you cant even drink the water because you be on the toilet for a week. And while your dehydrated, your ears breaking, your nose dieing, all you want is help. But everywhere you go they all look the same and they all have the same name....Jose. You have to spend millions on just little trinkets and everyone there is sleepy!!!! Evereyones lazy and smokes weed and nothing gets done. Is it hell? No its Mexico.
