I could review this better if I'd read longer. Know that for the last decade, the characters have aged in real time. Long-time readers feel almost like family to them, but unlike in For Better or for Worse, there is an element of absurdity to stave off the soap opera feel. If you ever felt remotely like a misfit in school, follow the adventures of the Other Clique, not all of whom are paranormal.
