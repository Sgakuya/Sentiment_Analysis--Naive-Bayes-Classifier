Oh the horror. There is nothing worse than Bit-o-honey, besides slathering your molers with cement and then closing your mouth. The pain these little bits would cause me. My grandparents always had these in a small bowl on their coffee table and we would run to them like they were gold..I don't know what was wrong with me. They are just TOO HARD. Thankfully, my grandparents' have since switched to Werther's.
