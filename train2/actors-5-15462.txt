Nellie Oleson was the girl everyone loved to hate on Little House on the Prairie -- just goes to show how good Alison was at playing the part. Nellie was probably one of the best comic relief characters I've ever seen on a TV drama. The rivalries between Laura and her on the show were often hilarious, but in reality, the two actresses were very good friends.
