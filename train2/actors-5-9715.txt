Great actress. Young and beautiful. Has starred in some great movies. One of her ancestors was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. She stars in a short video presentation that is shown with the traveling exhibit of the an orignal copy of the Declaration. Not only can she act, but she also appaers to be highly intelligent. I think her best role was n the little regaurded flick BEST LAID PLANS.
