Holy punk, Batman! Although he was tolerable in Facts of Life and alright in the underrated Batman and Robin , he just doesn't have a good personality. He insults a person suffering for a (Currently, we'll cure it soon) incurable disease just because he doesn't agree with his politics. Even worse, he seems almost anti-American in comparing Tony Soprano to George W. Bush. Plus, he's been in lots of bad movies like the vomit-inducing Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and the headache-drama, The Perfect Storm. And, don't even get me started on how bad ER is.
