Not a bad actress, but she is very intolerant and close-minded. She seems to have disdain for American--the country that allows her free speech and the ability to become rich, while there are so many poor and homeless people with nothing. She does, however, have a lovely smile and is nice looking, much prettier than her critics give her credit for. I'm happy that she sticks up for gay rights, but I don't appreciate her anti-American stance.
