Kate is absolutely one of the most talented actresses in today's movies. She is genuinly beautiful woman, very intelligent, outspoken, creative, and amusingly mature actress for her age. You can compare her to likes as Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore. She strikes me as a woman and actress with her daring and honest personality and her really natural beauty. She looks like a woman who can bent man's ego and bring him to his knees. Her eyes are expressive with a flash of feline hunger and at the same time kindness and emotion. She shines as a star not only because of her acting ability, but also because of her movie choices. You can truly tell that she is in the movie because of a tremendous hunger for acting, not for a paycheck. She is a true treasure that people should recognize.
