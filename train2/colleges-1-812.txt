UOP will accept anybody, regardless of their reading/ writing ability etc. Whereas, a traditional or even a community college always has some type of placement exams to see where you stand. UOP is just in it for the money so they will accept anyone. I took some classes there and was appalled at how some of the students in my "class" could not even write a sentence correctly. If you want a degree just to say you have one, and want to pay big bucks for it, this is the place for you. However, if you want any type of actual education, stay away. UOP is a joke!
