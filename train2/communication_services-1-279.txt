Bell Souths policy of Soc Locking the phone you BUY is terrible. Eventho you BUY the phone form BS you can NEVER use it again if it isnt on a BS account. In essence they (Bell South) still own the phone.If you want to change companies of move from the Bell South area you have to buy a new phone. The one you already bought from BS will not work.
