After watching the wedding finale of Friends, I feel that Matthew should try dramatic roles in the future. It seems he enjoys comedic roles but everytime I see him being dramatic, he does so well and is very good. I hope Friends will be on for two more seasons and perhaps Matthew will have time to do two more movies. Servicing Sara with Matthew Liz Hurley is due out soon!
