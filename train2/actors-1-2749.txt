Perhaps I didnt watch the movie Usual Suspects therefore i dun know why he is really that great. But I do see him in other movies like L.A. COnfidential, Outbreak, Se7en, I didnt see his talent differ so much from others and why people really like him that much. I think he is wayyyy too overrated and every moment that I see of him I would really get annoyed.
