Quote - people have time to sit around and obsess about some obscure actor. You have too much time on your hands if you have the TIME to complain about an actor you think is obscure. By the way, what makes him obscure ? Because the Entertainment Tonight tells you he's not? Some of the best actors in the world are not on your TV everyday, that doesn't mean they're still not great actors. And Christian Bale is a GREAT actor!!! American Psycho anyone?
