Cameron Diaz is and always has been my favorite actress. She's a great actress, she's smart, funny, Sexy as hell and I bet she would be just a fun person to be around. Did I mention she was Sexy as hell? The first time i ever saw was in the Mask. When she walked into that bank and did that Bend Over thing, that was it for me. I've loved her since that time. I have a huge poster of that same scene right above my computer. Long legs, a 5-Star figure and also blond, I will love her talent and her looks for as long as I'm Alive
