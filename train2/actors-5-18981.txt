He is annoying and self-absorbed but he gets a five with me for speaking out against Bush. All of the wacko's on this site who call hima traitor need to re-evaluate what makes America a great place. I've said it before and I'll probably say it again- if you call Michael Moore, the Dixie Chicks and Tim Robbins traitors for speaking out against Bush, then you have lost sight of what it means to be American and you don't deserve your right to freedom of speech. Bush is a president, (and a very poor one at that) not a damn monarch with absolute power.
