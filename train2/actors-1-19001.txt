I really can't say whether or not Moore deserved an Oscar or not, but his speech was unforgiveable. We have a fictional President from a fictional election and now we're fighting a fictional war. Hmmm, I don't think it's so fictional, you pompous ass, when our men are coming home in body bags, 60 Marines are MIA, and 7 of our soldiers are POWs. I don't think the real and obvious loss of lives is fiction. I don't think the pain and sorrow is fiction. And I don't think he should have used that opportunity to try to make our men and women in arms feel guilty about their cause. If you want fiction try listening to the lies that Saddam Hussein keeps telling to his own regime.
