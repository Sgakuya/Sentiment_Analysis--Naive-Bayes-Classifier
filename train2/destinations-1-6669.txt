Sorry, but pretty countryside does not a great state make. Eventually you may have to stop the car and do something there. And there's nothing of value to do in West Virginia. Dying state, nothing to do, no nightlife whatsoever, lousy restaurants, no culture to speak of, just Dullsville USA. You want to kill yourself after half a day, just to break the monotony. And let it be known I had to visit WV many, many times (my parents got stuck there and hated every single millisecond they lived there). But no one I have to visit lives there, and I'm happy.
