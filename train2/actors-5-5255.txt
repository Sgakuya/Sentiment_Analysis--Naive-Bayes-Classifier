DeVito is a phenomenal actor- in the TRUE sense, an Actor, he doesn't JUST show up. Seemingly better and better with each new release, with an already rich portfolio of credits, DeVito manages to mesmerize and enchant new audiences and devoted fans. DeVito, to his credit, always seems to fill the part and moreso. His versitility is why he may be considered the modern American equivalent of Anthony Hopkins or Jimmy Stewart... Thanks!! ..... .....
