Our Maine cable company was acquired by Adelphia about 3 years ago. Prices went up almost quarterly while service plummeted. Finally pulled the plug this morning and installed a DISH. When I called to have cable disconnected, NOW they are willing to discuss some pricing alternatives. Too little, too late.
