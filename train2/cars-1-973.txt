Have you ever driven an appliance - sort of like your refridge or washing machine. It does things fairly well but it has no personality! blah blah blah. Front wheel drive - blah interior - blah exterior - got to be for people who just don't care about what they drive. Ever notice how many old Honda's smoke?
