Gross! She makes me barf! She can only play one part as an actress and excuse me, but singing?? Come on!!!!! If I wanted to listen to a computer talk than I would ask my computer a question- I dont want to waste my money on Hilary's CD just to listen to a computer! If you cant sing, dont try to- leavge the carrier open for people with talent! Why do people think actress and singer are the same thing?????
