One of my favorite up and coming actresses, she gives all her roles a delicacy and heart that make her shine. Her acting style is quite reminiscent of Nicole Kidman. The majority of the films she appears in are not blockbusters but terrific B flicks instead. Her work in 21 Grams, for which she received an Oscar nomination was great...as was her roles in Le Divorce and Mulholland Drive. I expect her to definitely have staying power.
