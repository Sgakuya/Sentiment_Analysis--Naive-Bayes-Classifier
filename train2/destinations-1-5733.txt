With the reality of climate change becoming all the more a reality, it might be best to reconsider moving to Florida. Firstly it is not cheap in the most 'livable' areas. It is very difficult too find affordable housing in Miami, Sarasota, Fort Lauderdale, and even Orlando- very pricey, considering the low paying jobs. Crime is high, and there are other 'quality of life' issues that make Florida undesirable. Beware of future cyclonic weather, sea rise, flooding, and climate born diseases.
