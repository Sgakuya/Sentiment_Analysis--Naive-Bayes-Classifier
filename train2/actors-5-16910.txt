I truely hope the writers continue with the Bianca/Lena romance.....with Olga involved in this ground breaking story line I feel it can reach many veiwers who don't understand or are affraid of gay relationships. With her great acting I think it will show love has many different colours and AMC has a gem in Olga Sosnovska.....she is the only thing that keeps me tuned in...
