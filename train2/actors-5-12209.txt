One of the greats in my book. Pehaps she seems eccentric or odd in interviews but she was on broadway for a while...perhaps that had something to do with it. She has an uncanny way of being in a wild role such as War of the Roses or Serial Mom and still seem sexy at the same time. There was a comedy detective movie she was in that was great too..
