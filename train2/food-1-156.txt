Dear Mr. Gay Oats: It is my ultimate displeasure to inform you that your cereal, Honey Bunches of Oats, is the worst cereal ever created. Not only does it give you the sick-in-da-pit-o-growling feeling, it does not fill you. I find myself eating random scraps of plastic after eating your Oats to relieve myself of that displeasurable taste. Please make a new cereal. Luv, Kitten Caboodles
