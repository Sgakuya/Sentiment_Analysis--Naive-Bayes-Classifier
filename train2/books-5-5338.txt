This is the fifth book in Jean M. Auel's EARTH'S CHILDREN series. If you have not read the first four books in the series (Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, Mamoth Hunters, and Plains Of Passage) I recommend you read thisse books before attemtping this novel. Some of the impact of this novel was lost due to the long wait (roughly 15 years!) between the this one and the fourth novel. Ms. Auel definitly does her homework, and the stories all come off as believable. Ms. Auel has a way of leaving you wanting more, and this book is no exception. I read the book almost non-stop right after it came out, and now I can't wait for the sixth book. I have read the entiore series twice since then, and I can't get enough of Ayla and Jondolor!! I have heard these novels described as romance novels set in the stone age, but they are much better than that!
