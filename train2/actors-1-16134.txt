Maurice is one of the most overrated actors in dyatime. He is beyond horrible. His acting tics suck. He mumbles all of his lines and bats his lashes. The only reason he is memorable is because he is on the screen every damn day. He is the reason General Hospital sucks right now. Everything is about his character Sonny. The sooner he leaves the better.
