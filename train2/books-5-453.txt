I really enjoyed Charlotte's Web. It is such a great classic novel for children. It has a good setting, on a farm with animals talking. Wilbur, survives with the help of his spider friend, Charlotte. She ends up writing positive messages in her web, about Wilbur, to prevent anything bad from happening to him. I like to cry for joy in the end; although Charlotte perishes, she brings her masterpiece in this world, hundreds of spiders, and some stay with Wilbur, he takes great care of them, and builds new friendships.
