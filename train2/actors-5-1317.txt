Robert DeNiro is one of the greatest actors of the generation. From such fantastic work as Raging Bull , Taxi Driver , The Godfather Part II , and much, much more, his career is unrivalled in Hollywood. He is absolutely amazing on screen, and while his current roles haven't been the best (Men Of Honor, 15 Minutes, Rocky And Bullwinkle), he is still the king, the greatest actor, and no-one could ever rivall his career. Respect him. He goes to great lengths to portray his character, as everyone knows he gained 60 pounds or something for Raging Bull, learned to speak Sicillian for The Godfather Part II, and took up driving a cab for Taxi Driver. And like I said, his career is unrivalled, even people like Al Pacino haven't done as many good movies as DeNiro. The Godfather Part II, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull, The Mission, GoodFellas, Heat, Angel Heart, Mean Streets, Cape Fear and more. Summary: ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTORS OF THE GENERATION.
