NEGATIVES -->>>> Overcrowded, no jobs, poor paying jobs, bad traffic, Jersey Guidos, New Yorkers, high cost of living, insane home prices, high insurance rates, old people, illegal aliens with no driver's license or insurance, insane rental rates, condo conversions making apartments nearly impossible to find, keeping up with the jones' mentallity, rich snobs & South American playboys, restaurants always packed, grocery stores other retail shops sold out of items/empty shelves....... POSITIVES->>>> Nice weather during Winter months, too hot and humid during the summer months but the positive is less old people, south americans and rich playboys to contend with. Animal, Plant Life, Beaches and the Ocean if you no where to go to avoid the resident morons who think Florida is Long Island. Some good historic sites/areas if you know where to look. Everglades the last place in South Florida you can escape malls, restaurants and crowds, won't be long till it's all paved over for the sake of the thousands of New Yorkers and Jersey Guido Baby Boomers looking to move here! ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Living here you will either be a Have or a Have not. $31/Hour Part-Time sounds like a joke to me, unless you bought a house 10-15 years ago, that level of salary won't buy you squat in this day and age, especially if you r paying your own Health Insurance. Try qualifying for a mortage for a $400K house on $60K/year unless you have a wad of cash to lay down they will laugh at you.
