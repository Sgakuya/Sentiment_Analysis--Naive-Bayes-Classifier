I think De Niro is one of the best five actors of all times. OK, he has chosen sometimes wrong characters and sometimes overact too. But, what can you tell me about films like Mean streets, Godfather: part II, Taxidriver, The deer hunter, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, Jackie Brown, etc. Only for two or three of them he should be included in those five best. I really love the way he acts. When he is on the screen I can t pay attention to anything or anyone else. His movements, the incredible way he looks while he is speaking, the voice. But if you still think he doesn t deserve it, ok, don t give him five starts, but i would give him ten.
