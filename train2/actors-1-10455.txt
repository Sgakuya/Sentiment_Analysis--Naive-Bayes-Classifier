Ya know, I really don't see what people like in her. She has the personality of a wall, the acting isn't great, and her looks are mediocre at best. There were so many others that should have been in the Star Wars movies over her. I would have really liked it if they would have put Britney Spears or maybe even Drew Barrymore in this role...
