This comic strip always reminded me of Charlie Brown. Just like Charlie Brown, Ziggy always seemed to have bad luck, and nothing ever went right for him. People always made fun of him, just like the kids did to Charlie Brown in the Peanuts Comic Strip. I think it teaches kids to be hateful towards other kids for being different, and I just don't care for it. If I had children, they would not be allowed to read such hate. Comics are meant to be fun, or even political. I really don't think they should be used as a depression arena. 'kolby
