This is an atrociously bitter beer that makes its aftereffects feel something like revenge for having been seduced by rumors of its superiority. Put another way: A Bitch Goddess among beers that punishes whomever loves her and insists on secrecy to cover her private cruelties. Peel the label off a bottle sometime and thrust it into the unsuspecting hand of someone you despise. They will accuse you later of slipping them a rude mickey and avenge the deed by breathing on you. Should have been a product placement in Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?
