A great actor. I always thought if I could have a wish, I would like to sit down with Jack and a case of beer and have a schmooze. Not about acting but about the great Laker and Cletic games that he saw live. The confrontation between Magic and Bird has to rate as the greatest of all time.(possible exception Chamberlin, Russel).I always thought Jack would spot unique foibles and characteristics that others would miss.My being a life long Celtics fan, and Jack being a life long Laker fan, it should engender some passionate drinking.
