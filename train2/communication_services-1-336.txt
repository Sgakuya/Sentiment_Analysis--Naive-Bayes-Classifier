I had a two year contract going for about 18 months. I could no longer afford the bill so I had to cancel. I can see why they charged me an early termination fee (not really), but I was at a collection agency with in a couple of weeks, even after I told them it would take me a bit to pay it. I was even sending them small amounts of money and they still sent me. I tried calling them, they just referred me to collections. The collections said to call them. I will never deal with Cellular One again. They are very rude, cold, and uncaring!
