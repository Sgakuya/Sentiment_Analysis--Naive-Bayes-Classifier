Reese is one of my favorite actresses. She's not afraid to take on diverse roles. I loved her in Election (filmed here in Omaha where I live) - she made the neurotic overachiever Tracy Flick someone to root for, something not easy to do! I also liked her in 'Fear, Cruel Intentions and American Psycho, and she was an absolute delight in her latest film Legally Blonde - a very delightful and pleasant surprise. She's on her way up as a true leading lady and already has blossomed into a true woman by marrying Ryan (darn it, I wish I'd snagged him earlier!) and becoming a mother. Good luck Reese!!
