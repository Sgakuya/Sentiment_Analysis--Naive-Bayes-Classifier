I had never heard of Benjamin Bratt until he started going out with Julia Roberts. That is when I noticed this incredible looking man. He is tall, dark and so handsome but not in that generic way. I can't really judge his acting, as I have never watched the tv show he is on, I didn't see Miss Congeniality, or Traffic. I can say that I have seen him in a few interviews and he seems to have a personality to match his good looks, funny, witty and smart.
