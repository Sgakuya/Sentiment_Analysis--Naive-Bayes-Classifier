She doesn't do it all for the money. Her acting presence is so strong. Her characters speak the truth. She isn't afraid to explore other parts of herself in her roles. She brings such life and reality to her characters and in such a believable way. Angelina is so full of life. She is a great person on screen and even more off screen. She is honest to a fault. Her words are so profound. She isn't trying to find out who she really is and doesn't care if she never finds out. Angelina isn't afraid to say what's on her mind. She's not like some other people in show business who are so fake and are trying to hide themselves in lies. I respect her and her great closeness and love for her family so much. She lives her life never regretting anything. I admire The Talented Ms. Jolie so much for her honesty and straightforward attitude. While having such an honest personality, she still maintains being an incredibly intelligent and sweet person. She has the personality, presence, perserverence, and acting power.
