The only reason I am giving wells fargo one star is because the RATEITALL system doesn't let you give less than that. My advise to you: Be extremely careful when dealing with this people. I use to have a mortgage with them.. force me to have an escrow account to handle all tax and insurance expenses related to the financed property. Paid off the mortgage with an outstanding balance fo over 3000, which they promised to give back in an escrow refund check 15 days later.... That was last may. They still come up with bullshet every time I talk to them about my Money. And they will treat you as if you are really stupid....
