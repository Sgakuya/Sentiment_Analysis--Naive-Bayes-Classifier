I thought he was a great actor back when he did Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape. But Leo hasn't done a good movie in years. Titanic sucked! The Beach sucked! Man in the Iron Mask sucked! Of course this is just my opinion. But I just think he should go back to doing low budget indie films. It was in those movies that he gave his good performances.
