Bogart in Casablanca is a very sexy older gent who has very cool lines to say like Of all the gin joints in all the towns (woozy skull lolls into despairing hands) and she has to walk into mine in reference to a stunning and much younger Ingrid Bergman he once loved in Paris. The only drag line in the whole show is the fabulous Ms.B refering to Dooley Wilson as a boy .Bogey's performance in The African Queen is superlatives.He's dry-humor,droll and debonair who never had the benefit of the truth about tobacco. His legend is immutable.
