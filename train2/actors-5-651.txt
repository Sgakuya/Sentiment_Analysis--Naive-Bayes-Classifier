I have always loved watching a Fred Astaire movie. So what if the plots were sometimes paper thin.He was a wonderful dancer.He was so inventive in the dances he performed. I loved it when he danced on the ceiling He made dancing look so effortless { when I know it is a lot of hard work}I remember thinking gosh i wish I could dance like FRed Astaire
