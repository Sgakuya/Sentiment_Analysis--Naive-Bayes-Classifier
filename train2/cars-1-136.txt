I have had many brands from Kawasaki to yamaha and Suizuki. All were trouble free. I have 45 miles on my Artic Cat 650 HI. It is junk!!! Won't shift from 2-4 and back and now wiring harness is burnt up.Dealer says they have to deal with AC in the problems and AC won't return my calls.Don't buy an Artic Cat ATV!
