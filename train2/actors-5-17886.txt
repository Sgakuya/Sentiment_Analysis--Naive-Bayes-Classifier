Words can not describe how talented this woman is! She is beautiful inside and out. She sings, acts, and dance. She is my hero and idol!! I saw her in Hairspray and I just love her to death. She makes me laugh until my stomach hurts. She makes me cry until I have no tears left. She has a wonderful personality onset/onstage and offset/offstage. If anyone disagrees, you are just jealous of this woman who has made it big all at once. She is going to be a legend. I am her number one fan and watch One Life to Live every single day ONLY to watch her. I would go see Hairspray every night just to watch her. She amazes me and I hope I am something like her when I grow up and am successful. She makes me happy and she is the true woman in all of us. She amazes me each day I watch her. I cry and laugh when watching more than I have ever cried and laugh in my entire laugh. I am so glad I found this woman who shows that anything is possible, when you have the guts and believe in yourself. What is even better is that she gets the guy. She has made such a huge influence on me! I HEART YOU KB!!!
