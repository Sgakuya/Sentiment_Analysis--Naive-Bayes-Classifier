LOL this is what people in Arkansas are pround of!!!! if it wasn't for arkansas you would not have no wal-mart, no dillards, no allens canning company, no post cereals, no winchester or daisy rifles... So basicaly, we wouldnt be as fat, we wouldnt have as many guns, and we wouldnt have as much cheap crap that we buy from a store where the cleanest things are the toilets!
