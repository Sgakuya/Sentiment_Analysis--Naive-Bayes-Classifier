So many talented artists seem to flower briefly and then fade away. But Hitchcock had considerable staying power. His early British hits - The Thirty-Nine Steps , The Lady Vanishes - were then followed by his American classics - Notorious , Shadow Of A Doubt and so on, leading to the later period- North By Northwest , Psycho . His inventiveness and skill remained active for so many years.
