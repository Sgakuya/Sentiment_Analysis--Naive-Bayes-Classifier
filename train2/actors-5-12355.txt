First I would like to say congratulations to Halle Berry for becoming the first African American woman to receive the highest Oscar.I always knew that Halle was not just another pretty face, but a beautiful creature on the inside with phenomenal talent and a surging spirit. As an African American woman I would like to see more role miodels for our youth and she is undoubtedly a pride to cherish and remember for years to come.
