*shudders* I've compiled a list of the top ten celebrities that annoy me. Robin Williams is top dog, followed by Adam Sandler and William Shatner. I thought his movies were what repulsed me the most about him, until I saw him in an interview. He must think that he has to be always on. Unfortunately, on involves spouting out complete nonsense and dancing around like he's having multiple seizures. Is he on drugs or something? Robin, please retire.
