A woman I knew in childhood smoked these things constantly. In my mind's eye, I can still see the smoke curling up around her yellowed fingers. Needless to say, she's dead now from what was described as Classic smoker's cancer. It manifested itself first as a brain tumor, but the cancer had actually originated in the lung. The brain tumor was successfully removed, but she died soon afterward from the lung cancer. It was not a pleasant death.
