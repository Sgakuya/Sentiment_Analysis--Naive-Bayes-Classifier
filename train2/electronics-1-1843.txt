If you play vice city fair enough, that is brilliant, otherwise if you considering a new console buy an xbox, i don't like fleecing the pockets of microsoft, but hats of where it's due. Just hope they never try to draft windows onto an xbox, nooooo the pain nooooo the agony nooooo the ps2 is an old system now, if you want an truely old system buy a MEGADRIVE, don't take half measures
