I have attended CTU for the past 8 months in the SE program and have been thoroughly disgusted. I haven't learned anything, but keep getting "A's." The only reason I continued was because I figured in 6 more months I would walk away with an easy degree. But at what cost. I may never use the degree because I'm serving a 6 year enlistment in the Navy. Maybe I'll go officer. But if that were all that I wanted then I could have found a much cheaper institution. If I were to honestly walk away from this school and apply for work, I wouldn't be able to show proficiency enough to be hired. The books that are sent are worthless except for citing them as a bogus citation when you need one. The books are never taught from. It would be best to save a buck, not send them, and allow students to use other resources. Discussion boards are a joke because it is clear how many people just cut/paste/modify the work of others as thier own. Instructors practically hand you the completed assignment. A's are given like candy. One thing to ponder is that 99 percent of all SE curriculums require 3-5 years actual work experience or some kind of background. Because CTU will grant any peon a degree with an A average, they don't hold such a requirement. CTU just wants to be paid. Be wary of any program that seeks to reap the benefit of the max financial aid available. Do they really want to teach you or are they looking for a quick buck.
