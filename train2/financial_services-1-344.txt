This has got to be the worst bank ever.. We have been customers for years and have a great credit history.. All of a sudden they decide to jack our interest rate to 24.99% once we reached a high balance .. we used some of our savings to pay off the entire debt.. we were left with only debt on a Chase card... Then I find out Bank One buys Chase and instantly they jacked the interest rate of our chase card to 24.99% This bank should be stopped and the government needs to step in on this bank! Where is the protection of the government on this type robbery? BANK ONE is a bank run by thieves!
