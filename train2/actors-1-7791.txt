I thought this guy was leaving. He must have realized that he can make more money as a lousy actor in this country; than as one in Canada, or maybe he stayed because he couldn't get his brothers to pack up and go with him. Either way, its great that he's still here because I love being preached to by someone who lives in an insulated hollywood community, says stupid things, and gets paid way too much money to play make believe for a living.
