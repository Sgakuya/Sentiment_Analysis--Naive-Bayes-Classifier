I typically do not enjoy films Spacey appears in. Kpax, Pay It Forward etc... His skill is quite evident however. He is never the reason I dislike those films. Usually it is subject matter or the overall movie itself. Spacey is one of the best actors I have enjoyed watching on the big screen. Definitely one of the top 5 on this list. His range is incredible and he can do excellent drama or comedy. Whatever the role you can expect a fine performance.
