Now this is a great series of books. If you are like me who love to read about scary books but not yet to reading STEPHEN KING, this is a great set of books for you. The Fear Street books is based on a family feud dating back way to the early 60 b.c. date and travels on all the way to the 1900's where there is a street named after the feud where all the evil unleashes all over the street. It is really kinda great to read because not only that is it scary to read, but you can learn history while you read the books as well. My favorite series are THE CHEERLEADERS books. A Ghost from the 1800's lives for more than a century making cheerleaders do something against their wishes........
