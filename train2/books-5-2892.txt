This is an excellent book on the US Army in World War II. I especially liked the format; rather than giving a chronological account, or the account of just one battle or campaign or theater, Ambrose examines various topical areas such as the replacement system, the medical system, etc. It makes great reading, and some of the anecdotes are unforgettable (i.e., the US officer who tried to surrender to two German soldiers, who however insisted that he take them prisoner because there were two of them and one of him, and their two votes to surrender counted more than his single vote). Just a great book.
