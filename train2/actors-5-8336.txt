Everyone comments on The Wizard of Oz and A Star Is Born, which I agree seal her reputation as a film star. But, Judy was much more - she was The World's Greatest Entertainer without competition. To hear and watch her in concert, or talking with Jack Paar, or see her in Judgment At Nuremberg, one knows that Garland was a tremendous talent. Sure, the pills and alcohol did their damage and helped destroy her life, but they didn't destroy her talent. Even listening to her later TV appearances, such as singing (?) the song, It's All For You, you know you are listening to an artist - she makes you feel the emotion of the song with her phrasing and the power behind the final lyrics. No one compares to her - not Streisand, nor her daughter, Liza, and the pop stars of today are a sad joke when compared to the timeless talents of Judy Garland.
