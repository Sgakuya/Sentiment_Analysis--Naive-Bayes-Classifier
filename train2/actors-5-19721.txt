I LOVE LOVE friends...and EVERYONE on the show. i would give him a 4, but who cares if Ross is nerdy? it's his CHARACTER, not him! although he IS my least fav character, it's not his fault how Ross is a little bit of a nerd. he's ACTING as Ross, and doing a great job. He plays ross very well, and his 3 marriages were so funny...although Emily is annoying. HE MAKES THE SHOW WHAT IT IS AND IF ANOTHER ACTOR TOOK HIS PLACE...IT TRULY WOULDN'T BE RIGHT NOR WOULD IT BE THE SAME GOOD 'OL SHOW!
