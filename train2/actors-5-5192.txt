Okay. I'm not going to start calling him Heath like I know him or something, and I'm not going to say I love him because he's hot. I respect him greatly as an actor. I have not seen all of his movies, but from what I've seen he has a great presence on camera. There's something about him that portrays him as real. I know he's young and everything, but I think he's better than most of the more experienced actors out there.
