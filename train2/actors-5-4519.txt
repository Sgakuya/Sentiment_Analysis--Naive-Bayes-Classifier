Elijah Wood is one of the few actors these days with true talent. The naysayers on the board are evidently adolescent boys who are jealous of Mr.Wood's great looks.... Which should have no bearing on how he is rated as an actor. After seeing Fellowship of the Ring , he has moved to the top of my favorite actor's list....and I can tend to be quite picky. He has a great outlook on how he picks the movies he works on, is an intelligent person with a good disposition, and didn't allow himself to get type cast into the teen genre. I hope to see much more of him for many years to come.
