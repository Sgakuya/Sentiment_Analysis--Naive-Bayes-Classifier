This Young Man can be standing equally to Robert de Niro, AlPacino, and many others from the list of fame. THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL / TALENT IN HIM FOR SURE! I bet soon he will be holding oscars for Best Actor! Wishes of more success for you Edward Norton! For sure Brad Pitt is very good, but you stand much further!
