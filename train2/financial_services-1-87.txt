In defense of Krisie, it's not just writing bad checks that is the problem anymore. It's the debit cards, which the banks all heavily promote. They will instantly deduct the amount of the purchase the moment the card is swiped, even though the vendor may not put the charge through for hours or days. Yet when you make a deposit, they take their good old time crediting your account. Currently I am fighting a totally fabricated triple overdraft that never happened, and searching for a new bank. Avoid USBank at all costs!!
