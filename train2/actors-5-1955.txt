Yes! he's fine. He's talented and uncompromising about art. Benny and Joon , What's Eating Gilbert Grape , Don Juan de Marco Edward Scissorhands and Chocolat all display his considerable gifts and natural charm.Perhaps because of the success of Chocolat now he will receive the plum roles and more widespread applause. Bravo Johnny.You're a truly beautiful guy.
