It's in this hell hole state of NC. It will end up a hole soon, it already has one of the highest unemployment rates, and the bank of america (headquarterd in charlotte) is planning on laying off over 4000 people. I think it is safe to say, that the boom that made charlotte one of the fastest growing cities, has slowed, if not stopped. It was overrated as well. Living in Raleigh for a while, i went to Charlotte a lot, the airport sucks, and it just seemed overall bad, thats probably why their football team lost the superbowl, and their basketball team left town!!!!
