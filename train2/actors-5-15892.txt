It's so sad that General Hostpital has chosen to go the route it has in letting talented performers go. Stephen Nichols added a touch of class and dignity to this show with even the few weeks he was back in 2003. To have let him be written out in such a cavallier fashion and not to have seen the deeper potential for his character is not just a sin, but a travesty. We need more actors such as Stephen on Daytime TV. He was charismatic, seductive, handsome and an enigma all rolled into one. He is certainly missed.
