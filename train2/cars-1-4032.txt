Hyundai is a cheap piece of crap that will never come to the quality of Honda, Toyota or even Nissan. Hyundai's are built to a price, and since they're cheap, the material quality is quite low, as is the build quality. The V6 doesn't even have as much power as the 4-cylinders of Toyota and Honda, especially when hooked to a manual. Plus add in the fact the Santa Fe is ugly, and you have an all-around loser. Sure it has a good warranty but, unlike with the Japanese, you'll actually have to use it. A lot.
