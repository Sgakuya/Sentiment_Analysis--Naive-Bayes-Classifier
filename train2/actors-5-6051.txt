Cruise is one of the better actors around and is liked by both men and women. He has matured as an actor, from his days as a high school student in Risky Business to his portrayal of Ron Kovac in Born on the Fourth of July to Jerry Maguire. While I haven't seen all of his movies, I have liked every one of the ones I have seen.
