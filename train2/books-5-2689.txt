This woman's a Goddess. She's just oozing with creativity. Whether you are interested in any kind of cooking; crafts; home how-to projects; pets; plants; decorating, parties, etc. for holidays like Halloween and Christmas -- and I've probably left out a few dozen other things -- she's always coming up with new ideas. She even has magazines out now on Technology and kids' stuff. There's always something new one can learn. And Marc Marrone, the super-knowledgeable pet guy, is always a hoot to watch on her TV shows, with all the different animals he features. I know other guys who also appreciate her many talents; and I recommend her TV show, mags, and books to anyone interested in home and garden creativity, projects, cooking, entertaining, and decorating. She even puts out her own brand of paint, which colors I was never able to find in my local paint stores.
