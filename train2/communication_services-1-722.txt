Like most of the reviewers here I also had poor service with Sprint PCS. As my contract was coming to an end a Sprint customer service rep called me up to ask if I would be renewing my contract. I told him in no uncertain terms that I was one customer they would not be keeping. Just to be spiteful he had my service disconnected and I had to call them on a regular phone to have it restored for the remainder of the contract period. Although what the rep did was illegal, I was so close to the end that I did not bother to pursue it. I'd use two dixie cups and a string before I would ever go back to Sprint.
