David Spade the KING of sarcasm is probably one of the funniest actor/comedian you have ever seen. Not only does he have fantastic movies, he has an awesome T.V. show (which i recommend you to watch).Also he is a writer . After all the things he has been through in his life i think all people should honor and respect him. David Spade is sooooo yummy!!! lol lol jkjk he is really cute but he looks betta with short hair
