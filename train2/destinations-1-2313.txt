Unfortunately, I spent three deployments to the Persian Gulf which always included a port call in Saudi Arabia. Hot, windy, HOT, uncomfortable, AND DID I SAY HOT? It was after my third deployment there that I decided to take advantage of my GI Bill and get my teaching degree. A nice, cool, classroom beats sand anytime...LOL! I did find the Saudi people to be polite and respectful, but always so very serious. They should smile more!
