I think Steve Burton's talent is limitless! One day his time will come to suprise us all. I look foward to all of his scenes and am hoping he will have more emotions to play with...his depth is great! He deserves many more Emmy awards. To call him boring or a bad actor is completely wrong. That smile needs to come out more, it lights up a room!
