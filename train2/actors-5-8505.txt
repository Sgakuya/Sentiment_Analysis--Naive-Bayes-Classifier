Responsible for much of the pizzazz in anything she was cast. Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein would not have been the same without her hilarious presence. She had a great sense of timing and was very adept at putting that little touch of insanity into her characters. Her voice was perfect for comedy and made almost anything she said a riot. I would have liked to have seen her in more films but alas, she was another great talent taken too soon. She will no doubt be remembered fondly for many years... Oh, sweet mystery of life at last I've found thee!
