I agree that this book is absolutely brilliant. Joyce seemed to have invented a completely new language based on English that only he could understand or work with. So I don't believe that anyone who is not an English professor has ever read it through. It is not a book that can be read and understood and appreciated by anyone, it is just too indecipherable. I mean, you could spend an entire week completely decoding and interpreting a single paragraph. I suppose that some people have read it just to say they have, but don't go around telling anyone you've read it because they will not believe you, just I as will not believe you unless you are in pursuit of a Ph.D in English Literature.
