I'VE HEARD SOME TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT UP THERE:HOW EVERYONE IS A SOLVENT ABUSER OR PROPANE HUFFER...IT'S MOSTLY A DRY COMMUNITY AND SO BORING THAT THE KIDS JUST SIT THERE RISKING THERE LIVES PUFFIN ON A PROPANE TANK,I'VE HEARD OF CHICKS TRYING TO SELL THEIR KIDS FOR A CARTON OF CIGARETTES....SO IT ISN'T THE BOOZE ANYMORE
