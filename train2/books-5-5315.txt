What a wonderful book. I was sucked in from the first page and could not put it down. Heavy subject matter - a young girl is raped and killed, but she is the protagonist of the story - from heaven. I got to know her, her family and her friends, all in reaction to this huge, life changing event, and I fell in love with all of them. Do not miss this book.
