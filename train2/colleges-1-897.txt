I am currently enrolled at the DeVry Federal Way campus. In the past, DeVry has had a very good reputation. However, at least for the Federal Way school, I would have to say it is one of the worst. Very few of the teachers have worked in the fields that they are teaching about, and even fewer even have a clue how to teach. One of the teachers, and Economoics instructor, is teaching the small systems class. It's a complete joke! I can't speak for any of the other campuses, but spending over $6,0000 a term at this school is a waste of money. Choose a real school before you attend DeVry.
