Olga is an amazing and talented actress. She has made day time TV a joy to watch. The only bad thing is that AMC is not using her to attract more watchers which I am sure that she could do. She lights up a scene like no one that I have ever seen in a long time. You can feel the emotion that she is putting out through the screen. She is totally committed to her character when performing. And it doesn't hurt that she is beautiful!!
