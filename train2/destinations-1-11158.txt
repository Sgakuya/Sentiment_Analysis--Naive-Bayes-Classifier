It's acceptable if you can find that tiny plot of sand in between the pretentious upper E/W siders, frustrated in their attempt to escape their shoe box apartments for the weekend for the joy of sleeping 20 in a room made for 2, and the bridge and tunnel crowd that's out looking to fornicate with anything that can't run away. In the summer it's like a recurring nightmare, where you dream you've finally alluded all of the people you want to get away from, only to find out they all went to the same travel agent.
