As good, if not better than Da Vinci code (which was outstanding). A&D had some real good plot twists that caught me by surprise (although I should have realized that there was 40 pages to go and SOMETHING had to happen). I also found Brown's mandatory brainy bimbo-cum-heroine in A&D (Italian scientist and Yoga Master [Yowsah!!!] Vittoria Vetra) more intriguing than the Frenchie Da Vinci Code girl. Dan Brown books educate as well as intrigue. I learned much about the Pope and the Papacy. Brown knows the Devil is in the details and he leaves no stone unturned. As with DaVinci Code, I found that this book had the one flaw of Robert Grafton, time and again, literally pulling a needle out of a haystack in solving some arcane medieval equivalent of the New York Time Sunday Crossword puzzle in a matter of seconds. [In fact, it seems like he could pull a needle out of his ass while buried in a giant haystack.] Definitely worth reading.
