Vonnegut has few peers in his ability to communicate a signficant message to millions. Insightful, witty, skilled, moral without being self-rightseous--no easy task--he will be recognized years from now for his ability to reach and touch people, and entertain and engage us at the same time, even when the story underlying it speaks to our weaknesses, cruelty and foolishness. An artist with few equals.
