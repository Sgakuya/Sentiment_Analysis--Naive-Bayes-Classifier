Ive been here for about 8 months now, I moved from montreal last summer after finishing school at concordia university. By all means, i definately came here with an open mind. People who know me here would definately back that up. However 8 months after i am totally sickened by this city It seriously sucks ass.. lol The only good thing about it is the job market, especially for us bilingual people :P Reasons why i hate it: -Cost of living is rediculously high -Crime is abundant -People are real assholes -Motorists are very aggressive.. (i wonder why insurance is soo high ??? ) - and to top it off, assholes cant leave my honda alone... always vandalizing and breaking into it... ( i think other honda owners can relate) Thats just my 2 cents.... I really miss montreal... someone please take me home.... *sniff*
