Diploma mills are bullsh#t for people who don't have the time to invest in the classroom or actual academic research. Research and learning takes time. College credits for life experience? What? I don't care about your experience, I care about your academic work. Only in America (home of some of the worst math and science test scores among industrialized nations) would we invent a place where people get degrees that don't mean a damn thing. What a total joke.
