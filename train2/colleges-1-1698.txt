Academically, the least distinguished of the service academies, which are nothing to write home about anyway. This is a school that enfranchises and supports the sexual harassment and rape of female cadets and then gets its knickers in a twist when the Outside World expects, for good reason, some accountability. If they don't clean up their act in this regard at this killer training ground, the citizens/taxpayers should force the government to close it down.
