Matthew Perry is a great actor and has lots of talent. He's especially great in 'The Whole Nine Yards' and 'Friends'. I also think he deserves someone in his life, and its funny how he really means it that his life is portrayed onto friends (meaning his sense of humor, sarcasm, etc). I feel really bad for him right now with all his painkiller addictions. I hope he comes back to friends soon so he can marry monica.
