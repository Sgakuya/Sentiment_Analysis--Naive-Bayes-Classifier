This book should be read by anyone who wants to know the biography of one of America's greatest presidents. Donald makes Lincoln's story come alive. Not only do you get Lincoln's story, but you also get the circumstances surrounding the times. It almost seems like you are living in the 1800's in frontier Kentucky and Illinois.
