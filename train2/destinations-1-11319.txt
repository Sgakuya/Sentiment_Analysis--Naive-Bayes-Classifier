This is the worst vacation destination ever. The scum of the earth hang out here. I'm a New Yorker, and even *I* was scared to walk on the boardwalk at night. You can tell how classy this place is by the number of people wearing sweatpants. If you wear khakis instead of sweats, the boardwalk scum will harass you because they think you're rich. And the casinos are ugly, ugly, ugly! Donald Trump has no style...you can see it in his buildings and his hairdo. Go to Vegas for a better gambling vacation experience.
