Customer service is horrible. Getting a live rep that actually speaks english and understands how to help you is next to impossible. And when you actually find somebody to speak with they are either inept or powerless. My favorite was when we recived a flyer for unlimited calling (long ditance + local) for $30 a month. What a deal! I asked every question I could think of and finally asked what my monthly charge including all fees and taxes would be. They promised it would be $30. First months bill was $64. Stay away.
