An excellent actor whose performances have yet to once disappoint me. He shows he is quite versatile (from doing Fight Club to Red Dragon to American History X, I mean, those are very different roles). If I knew nothing else of a movie but the fact that he was starring in it, I would give it a chance. (AMENDMENT: Ew. I saw Italian Job , and THAT was the weakest performance by Norton yet. I don't blame him--they didn't give him much to work with, really, it's a shame. To his credit, I heard he wanted to bail out of that movie, anyhow, and I can see why. So, to change my first statement, I'd like to see every movie that Edward Norton stars in EXCEPT Italian Job .)
