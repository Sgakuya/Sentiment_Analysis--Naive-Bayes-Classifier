For those who are commenting one role doesn't make an actor need to look at some of the people they are touting as a godsend to Hollywood. Stallone? His career was launched by one role....and then he made three sequels! Jason Isaacs obviously selects a wide variety of roles which challenge his acting abilities...and have done so quite well...as opposed to merely starring in shoot 'em action pictures. One can always tell a good actor by the multi-dimensional characters they choose to play...as opposed to some fly-by-night duplicate time and time again.
