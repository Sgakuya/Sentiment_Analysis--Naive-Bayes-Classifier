I am in love with everything about this comic strip, and in lust with both Pib and Dru. Pib is free and selfless, innocently sensual and sexy/beautiful in the way only a true ingenue can be, and instantly affectionate and easy to get close to. Dru is hungry sensuality ready to grab and take you - both are extremely attractive. McEldowny gets what makes women sexy and in both Pibgorn and 9 Chickweed Lane he is not afraid to let his female characters be sensual and sexy. Unfortunately, Pibgorn will probably never be a Sunday comic in your typical newspaper because of that, but we can always hope. Oh, and an engaging story line and good character development don't hurt either (I don't get the guy that says it's hard to follow??!!).
