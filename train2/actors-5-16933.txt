Olga takes anything that the writers give her (which hasn't been much) and makes it into a masterpiece. Her eyes and body language are so powerful - she can be standing in the background in a scene with no lines, and still has the ability to steal the scene. This actress has so much talent, that I believe it is only a matter of time before someone in the business sees what she has and gives her the role of a lifetime. Besides that, of course, she's gorgeous, charming, and so real.
