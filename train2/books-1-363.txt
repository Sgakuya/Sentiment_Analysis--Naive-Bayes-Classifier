This book actually has other titles and authors. Some of you may know it as The Trial by Franz Kafka. Jon Carroll of the SF Chron says he knows it as The Gulag Archipelago. I'm waiting for the exciting real life sequel in which the one of the mice comes in with a briefcase full of semiautomatic weapons and takes out the rats who keep moving the cheese.
