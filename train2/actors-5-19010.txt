Michael Moore did great work with Roger and Me in the early '90s and released his new masterpiece Bowling for Columbine in 2002. His atypical documentary format is perfect for producing thought-provoking films. The intelligence and passion that is obviously involved in the Moore experience is obvious with the final product. We need more people like him to present an idea and amplify the message through facts and interviews of people on both sides of the argument.
