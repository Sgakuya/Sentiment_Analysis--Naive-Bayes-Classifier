This is the absolute biggest con-job company in the industrialized world. They make Enron and Tyco look like a charity organization. Do yourself a favor if your not a costumer and RUN! DO NOT go with this company. Their costumer service reps are clueless. All they are trained to do is sell, sell, sell. They will transfer you to 100 other extensions, and the people at those extensions are more confused then the person that transferred you there. Claire the robot, there's a joke! All # options lead to the same place, an hour of music. On 2 occasions I've had costumer reps tell me they suggest I pay a little MORE then my bill is for, this compensates for any over usage they said. I have never heard of such a thing...never.
