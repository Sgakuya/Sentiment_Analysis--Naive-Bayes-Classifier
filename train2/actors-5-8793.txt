She's sweet, adorable, and gorgeous, if anyone deserves a 5/5, it's her. She's worked hard to get to where she is, but she doesn't forget where she comes from, her scenes are mind-blowing, both physically and emotionally, and she never fails to inspire women to be both strong and sensitive. I can't wait to see how far she'll go throughout her career but I'm certain it'll be fantastic!
