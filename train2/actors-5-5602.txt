I love him! He's a great actor, a great dad, and a great guy in general! he is that contradiction all women search for and are told by Oprah that they will never have because it doesn't exist; well Oprah it does and his name is Val Kilmer! He's sweet and sensitive, yet all man, ya know that natural male grace some guys have, he's suave and charming;not to metion great looking. He is what ALL men should strive to be!
