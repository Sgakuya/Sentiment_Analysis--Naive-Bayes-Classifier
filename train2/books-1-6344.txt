This man is a fanatical blow-hard. He is seriuosly a paranoid, delusional man who believes every aspect of the left is inherently evil. If this man were president: every man woman and child would be poor except him; there would be no civil rights; minorities would be expelled from this country...this is his vision of what America should be. I say he is a shame to our great nation, an orator of hate, the only solace that we may have is that hell keeps people eternally after death.
