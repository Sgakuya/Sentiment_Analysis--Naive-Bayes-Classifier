Scorcese is the greatest director of his generation. That said, it's worth keeping in mind that his movies would not be what they are without the contribution of great actors like Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel (both of who debued in Scorcese's Mean Streets!) Scorcese's two best movies-Taxi Driver and Raging Bull-owe their unique emotional force to the writing of Paul Schrader-a truly brilliant scriptwriter (I would rank him #1 if there were a list for scriptwriters) who himself went on to direct The Affliction. PS-I suspected that Martin Scorcese was burned out in the late 90s, but then he makes yet another masterpiece, Gangs of New York! The man is a national treasure.
