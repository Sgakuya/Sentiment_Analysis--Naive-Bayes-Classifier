Kevin Spacey is one of the few remaining men in Hollywood who is a true movie star. Someone who doesn't misuse their fame or talent, but who's goal is to put truly good movies out into the world. And he succeeds, because he is one of the most talented stars ever to grace the screen. I have yet to see him in a role he didn't play perfectly. He is an outstanding actor, and he reminds me of the stars of old.
