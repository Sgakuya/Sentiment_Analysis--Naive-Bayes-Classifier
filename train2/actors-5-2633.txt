I know the guy's kinda skinny, and he's got a big nose, but there's a certain charm about him. I love him. I love the way he acts, I love the way he stands, I love everything about him! He deserves an Oscar. This is an actor that I seriously can't get enough of. I want to see him in as many movies as possible. He's so... cool!
