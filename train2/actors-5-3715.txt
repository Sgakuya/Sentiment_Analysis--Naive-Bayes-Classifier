I've only seen Orlando In Lord of the Rings and Black Hawk Down so far, but I'm impressed with the quality of his work. His portryal of Legolas was well rounded and he captured the quality of the elves perfectly, with movements, voice, etc. He seems to be in very high demand in Hollywood these days, and although that's probably in part due to his gorgeous looks, I really think he has the acting talent to back it up. I'm very excited to see him in Ned Kelly Pirates of the Carbbean The Calcium Kid and Troy . I think he's really going to prove himself to people who think he's just another pretty face
