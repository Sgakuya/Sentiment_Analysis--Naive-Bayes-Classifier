Satellite TV is a complete waste of your time. Not only do you have to buy a reciver for every TV, they suck you in with commitments that you have to stick with or pay up. They signal goes out every time it rains. Local channels cost extra (if you can even get them at all). You don't get vidoe OnDemand like you do with cable. Thier customer support sucks. Trust me, it isn't worth wasting your time, money, and sanity.
