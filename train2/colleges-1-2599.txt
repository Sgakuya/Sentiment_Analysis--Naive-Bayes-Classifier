Very much not worth the money or the hassle. Even less value if you enroll in the college of business. It's the largest college of the university but gets the least space. Although some of the part time teachers are quite good and dedicated the full time faculty are sub-par at best. The student body is cliquish and most seemed to be from the lowest rungs of public schools. Nothing gets accomplished without endless PC bickering if at all. Services are extremely limited when they exist and required classes are offered infrequently and at odd times leading many to take more than 4 years to graduate.
