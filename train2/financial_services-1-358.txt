BankOne is pretty close to the bottom of the barrel, as the Big Banks go. I ended up with BankOne TWICE as other places I banked got gobbled up in acquisitions. More than any other bank, they have TWO main things going against them: First, they are always first to find new ways to charge a fee for any and everything they do. Fee for your statement, fee for your deposit slips, fee for counting the cash, fee this, fee that. They were the first to charge fees for information, even. Second, (at least at the three different branches I used) is poor customer service. Biggest annoyance: Poor staffing. It doesn't take a degree in rocket science to figure out that a lot of people will try to cash their paycheck on Friday, during lunch hour. So WHY send all the tellers to lunch, so there's just one person to help 300 customers? And WHY not empower the customer service people so they can actually ANSWER the questions you finally get to ask-- after an hour in line? Sorry, thumbs down....
