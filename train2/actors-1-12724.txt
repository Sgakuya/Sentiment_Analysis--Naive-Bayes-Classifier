Simply an actress of very little talent and excellent connections. I will not pay money to see any movie featuring Gwyneth, and judging by her box office other moviegoers feel likewise. Yet mysteriously Gwynnie keeps getting excellent parts which should be going to women who can genuninely act, thanks to friends of family such as Harvey Weinstein (whose Miramax spent $15 million on the marketing campaign to buy her an Oscar). Only an American would consider hers a decent English accent.
