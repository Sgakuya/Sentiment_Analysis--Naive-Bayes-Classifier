I was in the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program. I don't believe that it's possible for a graduate program to be less rigorous. I felt absolutely cheated. Also, if you're an undergraduate and love the outdoors, it's probably a great place to be, but if you're a graduate student, not outdoorsy, and can't afford to live in Hanover itself, it's pretty much a wasteland. I regret my experience bitterly.
