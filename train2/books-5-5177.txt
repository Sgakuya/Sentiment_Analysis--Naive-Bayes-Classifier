One the best books by John Irving. The story about the interesting life of a midget who was much bigger than his small stature. So big, in fact, that his speech in the book is always written in CAPITAL LETTERS. It is his story, and the story of his best Friend, and how little OWEN affected the lives of everybody who met him. Recently made into a motion picture under the name SIMON BIRCH. I highly recomend this book for lovers of good literature everywhere. If you have never read any of Irving's work before, this(along with WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP) would be a good place to start.
