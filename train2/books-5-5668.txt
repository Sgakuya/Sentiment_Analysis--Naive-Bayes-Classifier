Hazy shade of winter - neh- neh neh -neh- neh -nah neh. Just kidding. Andrew Mcarthy rules! I used to love this movie when I was a kid, but now it sucks. The book I loved as I do anything by Ellis. I didn't even know about Ellis, or that this was even a book until I read 'American Psycho' several years ago. 'Less Than Zero' is definitely green and raw, but good none the less. In fact, I enjoy that style of writing more. F%ck commas. Go read 'Tribulation Force', haters. Jesus is coming - ooooooooooh. I got off the plane and everybody was gone! Oh my goodness. No he dit-unt.
