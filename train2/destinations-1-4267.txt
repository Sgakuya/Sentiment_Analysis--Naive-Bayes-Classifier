This city give me the creeps. Shopping malls and immaculately groomed steel and glass office buildings line 8 lane highways. It doesn't seem like anyone is ever walking around here...where could they all be? Sadly these are the only things I have ever noticed about this place. (I should mention that the food is good - lots of tex mex and beef)
