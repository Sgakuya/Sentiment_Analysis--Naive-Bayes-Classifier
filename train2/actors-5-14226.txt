I am truly a big fan of Jada's. I am always captivated by each and every character she plays, because she is so passionate about each one. She also has such a wide range of emotions that she can play very well. I especially enjoyed her in Set It Off, where she made me laugh, cry, and feel joy and pain. Jada Pinkett (weep-weep) Smith is a wonderful actress and I look forward to seeing her again in the future.
