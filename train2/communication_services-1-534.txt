The worst customer service I have ever experienced!!! If you ask a question online, they make you call. Once you call, expect to be transferred several times and hold for 10-20 minutes or longer. If you are lucky enough to talk to someone, they give you bad information! Needless to say, I am stuck with my contract for an extra two months because of bad info given to me by a rep regarding Standby mode on my account. The service is okay but very expensive for what you get. You will get a lot more bells whistles with other services at no cost where Nextel will nickel dime you...
