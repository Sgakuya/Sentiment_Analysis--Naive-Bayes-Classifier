Gene, Gene, Gene... now there was a man who could've swept me away... and I'm a lesbian... ha ha. My favorite movie with Gene is Summer Stock with Judy Garland. Truly amazing what this man could do on his feet. Great looking, great singing voice, I miss him. They just don't make 'em like they used to.
