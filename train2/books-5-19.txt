This is a book that will make you cry, laugh, get angry, depressed, happy and all at the same time. It is sometimes slightly graphic, but not so much by today's standards . Mostly it is honest. You feel as though you have visited a time in history that was very hard for everyone the world over and you arrived at the lowest common denominator. You can't imagine that it could get much worse than this, yet there is hope and there is survival. Frank McCourt has a conversational style that immediately engages you giving you the feeling that you are sitting around the fireside with him. I couldn't put it down.
