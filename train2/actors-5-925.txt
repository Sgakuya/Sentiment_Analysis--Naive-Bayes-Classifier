Surely one of the very finest American actors,with a magnificent range of work to his credit.Towering,awesome in the Godfather series-such insight and depth to Michael Corleone's character development.More than held his own opposite the great De Niro in the excellent Heat(their first time together on screen,though of course both were in Godfather2).Astonishing as the sympathetic gay bank-robber in Dog Day Afternoon.Oscar-winner as the embittered,blind ex-military man in Scent of a Woman.Riveting as the intense hippy cop in Serpico.Charismatic gangster in the sumptuous Scarface.Superb,too,in The Insider,Carlito's Way,Sea of Love and Donnie Brasco..Whether playing his roles with hungry conviction or quiet authority,his presence has only rarely been less than magnetic.A living screen legend.
