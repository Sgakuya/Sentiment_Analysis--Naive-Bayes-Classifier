Massachusetts sucks and I left. I can't imagine it's gotten any better, only worse. I've seen all of the museums, been to Cape Cod, been to Cape Ann, been to Boston. Nothing was new just different coats of paint on the same old shitbox. The people are downright rude and unfriendly and too caught up in the "We want to preserve the historical (or is it "hysterical") character of our town" mentality. You can't eat history, you can't get a job (Mass ranks 45 out of 50 in job creation), businesses move out not in, one party rule, taxes and costs go up, the country moves on and Mass is stuck in the past.
