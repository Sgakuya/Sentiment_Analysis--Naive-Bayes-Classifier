This is one of the best novels I have read. It is about a missionary Baptist minister who takes his wife and four daughters to live in Africa. The story is told from the point of view of each of the daugthers. This novel has a political theme - not the type I would usually choose - but it is told on so many levels it keeps you absolutely enthralled. Barbara Kingsolver is an amazing storyteller. Given the subject matter (politics, religion, culture), she did an amazing job of making this novel funny. The characters will make you laugh, anger you, and possibly make you cry. This book is a classic. If you want to read something that goes a little deeper, pick this one up. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed it.
