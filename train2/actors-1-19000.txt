I'm so sick of this bloated jerk. People have been saying that it took courage for him to do what he did but that's bogus. When Moore got up on stage he thought he was going to get a big standing ovation from the Hollywood crowd and for a second I was afraid that he might. However, I was relieved when the majority of the crowd booed his fat ass off the stage. I can accept the fact that Moore takes a lot of liberties when presenting his version of the truth in his documentaries, but his behavior at the awards truely showed him as the exploitive, self serving, ungrateful creep that he is. I'm sure that our soldiers in Iraq right now were thrilled to hear that they are risking their lives for a fictional purpose, fighting a fictitous war, and being led by a fictitious president. For Moore to get up there and still be crying about the election is pathetic. Nobody cares about Gore (and I'm saying this as somebody who voted for him), he had his chance and he blew it, even Clinton called him a loser. Moore's made a ton of money by bashing this country and the least he could do is show an ounce of class and keep his hard on for G.W. to himself while he accepted his little statue.
