Let's see...what do they not carry: Hallmark Channel, Boomerang, Oxygen, WE, Nicktoons, and more! SOme of those stations I don't particularly care about, but I do enjoy Hallmark and Boomerang. Also, the picture quality varies from station to station unless you use composite cables. The local commercials are bad and distracting as well. Thankfully, I'm moving out of Delaware in a couple of months and won't have to put up with this pathetic and overpriced provider any longer...
