Creepy bald sawed-off shrimpy runt whose claim to fame was playing a creepy bald sawed-off shrimpy runt on one of the most overrated pieces of dogcrap ever to run on TV. Now that's acting!!! Interesting that his career has been in freefall since that piece of dogcrap was flushed down the terlet by NBC. Showed that he had nowhere the talent to support his own sitcom, and if you're incapable of doing that, you should go into painting houses for a living.
