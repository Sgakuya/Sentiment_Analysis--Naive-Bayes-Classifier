Isn't this a survey about ACTING. If this guy is such a great actor, than why doesn't the comments here reflect that. All I see here under comments are things like he's a hottie , he's down to earth, so humble , he's just like a drinking buddy , a take home to mom kinda guy. Doesn't ACTing count for anything here. Obviously not, or you would all be giving him a 1 for ACTING, instead of a 5 because he's sooo likeable and sooo hot.
