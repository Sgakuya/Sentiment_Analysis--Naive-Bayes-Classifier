I am very close to having my 30th B-Day in November, and I am CRAZY over Matthew McConaughey!! Mr.McConaughey is the best looking man who has ever graced the movie screens !!! He has beautiful eyes that you can get lost in and simply a PERFECT SMILE and his voice .... OOOOHHH MERCY..I could listen to him talk 24 hours a day!! I melt every time I hear his voice and see that beautiful smile!!! What I would give to meet him in person !!!! I loved EDtv and U571 - Have not seen The Wedding Planner yet, but hope to soon. Keep up the GREAT work Matthew !!! LOVE YA!! P.Addis (MattCrazy) South Carolina
