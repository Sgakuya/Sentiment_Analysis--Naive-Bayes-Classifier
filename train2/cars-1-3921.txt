Another great scam by GM. Take a Tahoe add On-Star and badges - INSTANT CADILLAC! How about something new for a change?? Where's the Cadilac Big Block Engine? Might as well buy the Chevy and spend the extra money on something worthwhile. GM used to be a leading Automobile Company but now they can't even follow good. The word of the day is INOVATION.
