This car is a real value! It's the cheapest Honda of all and it looks the same as the expensive Acura. They probably use the same drawings for the Civic as the Acura only on a smaller scale. Smart people them Japanese Honda folks. Heck they are made in Ohio (now it's an American car)with good old Japanese tooling, transported Japanese suppliers and surprise Japanese Management. I should have rated this car a 5 but I'm feeling bad about the lack of balance in these ratings!
