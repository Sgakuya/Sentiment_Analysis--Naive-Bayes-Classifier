This is one of my favorite books. Haha, I like the comment from GrtflMark......instead of explaining how Al Franken supposedly lied, he resorts to calling him names. Al is very careful to check all of his facts and explain where he got his information. As opposed to Rush who pulls all of his info out of his very large ass. By the way, what is a crock-sucker ? :)
