I don't think this state will ever become anything more than the most back-water state in the union. I spent a year stationed in Mississippi, and I couldn't count the days fast enough until I left. The beaches are filthy (in fact they dump their sewage into the Gulf), people are rude and ignorant, and weather is always hot and muggy. The only reason anyone should be in this state is if you were driving through it to get somewhere more civilized (ie, anywhere other than Mississippi).
