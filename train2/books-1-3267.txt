UGH! I tried and tried to read this book. I would pick it up and think how well reviewed Dean R. Koontz is and I must be missing something. No luck! No matter how many times I tried to get into Fear Nothing, I just couldn't. It just dragged on and on without any real level of suspense, he tried to put some twists in there, I just couldn't get into it. It is one of the few if not ONLY book I have started and had no desire to finish.
