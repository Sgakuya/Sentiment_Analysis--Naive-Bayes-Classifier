Harleys are all about trying to project this tough, outlaw, biker image. Drop 20k at your local Harley dealership and you are in the brotherhood. I love the Harley pose by some of these bikers. You know, the chin up, no smile, I'm bad look. Weak!!! Bad news for you sheeple, many Harley parts are made in Japan. Hello???????
