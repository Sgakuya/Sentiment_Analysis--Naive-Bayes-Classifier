Renee Zellweger does have a sweetness about her on film that can be quite charming, but that's all she has going for her. She has absolutely no skill in portraying a character; she squints and pouts her way through every role she takes, and never fails to be annoying, clingy and whining. I dare anyone who thinks I'm just being a bitch to rent A Price Above Rubies . Renee plays a Hasidic Jew-enough said!
