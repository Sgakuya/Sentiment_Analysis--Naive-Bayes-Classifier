Heath Ledger is such a good actor!! His accent, his smile, and his gestures are all SEXY!! I first saw him in 10 things I hate about you , and I realized he's a good singer as well.(he-he) His new film the patriot along w/ Mel Gibson, heath portrayed the ideal son excellently. He should be nominated for the best supporting actor!
