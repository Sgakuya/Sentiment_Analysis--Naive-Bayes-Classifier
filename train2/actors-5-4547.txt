Amazing, he's amazing. THe guy's talent will never die. And...he's got a pretty big package... lol j/k! Even though he did show his butt and *ahem*...other parts in Wild Things or whatever the movie was. All in all, he's really good. doesn't matter if Hollow Man wasn't as good as it should've been. It survived with Kevin in it, though.
