Michael J. Fox is a wonderful actor. He was the star of a movie that easily became a classic trilogy in American pop culture, Back to the Future. That mid-'80s sci-fi always fascinates me. I also really like how Fox plays Alex P. Keaton on Family Ties, being a right-wing conservative. It's so easy to hate the little kid. Wonderful actor.
