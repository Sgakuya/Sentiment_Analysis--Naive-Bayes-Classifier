It's not Gaarder's fail that not all philosophers were interesting, but he did the best he could out of the not always impressing thoughts he dealt with! This book isn't primarily about philosophy, but how a young girl's life is turned up-side down because of something she is not lord over. The ending is discutable, I have yet to find a person who liked it: Not my sister, not my Chilean lover, definately not me. Beside of that, I really recommend this huge book! :-)
