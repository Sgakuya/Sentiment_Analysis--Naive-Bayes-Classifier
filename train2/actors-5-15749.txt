Ted King is the best actor on GH. Without question. Too bad there are people out there that are so fixated on their agendas that they feel they have to bash an actor to make themselves feel better. Grow up people. Ted King is an awesome actor and deserves to be respected for what he has done on GH as an actor, regardless of what you feel about his character.
