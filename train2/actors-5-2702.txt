This actor is phenomenal. As another review put it, he makes the character he plays so realistic : a crook in Usual Suspect , a shy - full of complexes guy in Pay it forward , an emotionaly disturbed lost family man in American Beauty , a tyranic agent in Swimming with Sharks etc .. You always forget the actor and immerse in the story. One the best current actor. Period.
