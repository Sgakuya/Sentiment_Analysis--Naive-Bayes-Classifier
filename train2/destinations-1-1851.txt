Land of the Free? Not anymore. New Patriot Acts and such have made us no better off than we were under the British rule 200+ years ago. Our Economy is falling apart faster than anyone can believe. Our citizens are materialistic, fat, lazy, stupid, uppity pigs who care about noone but themselves. The cities are all dangerous, police are just as dangerous as criminals. The draft says that once you turn 18 you can be forced to kill for your country without really knowing why but aren't allowed to drink or do just about anything else even rent a car. Our government cares more about oil fields thousands of miles away than it's citizens. And to top it all off our education standards are lower than any other 1st world country by a longshot. Summary: Don't bother vacationing to America, it's horribly overrated as a vacation destination; horribly expensive and the same thing after a week. Don't consider living here either, especially if you are foreign born, gay, or liberal. The people are more close minded than anywhere else on earth, gays and minorities are looked down upon and commonly denied fair treatment and rights. If you want the land of opportunity and the land of the free, go to Canada.
