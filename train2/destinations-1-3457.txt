This is a terrible place, at least as a destination. It should only be visited if seeing the Sox or the Revolution sites, but should otherwise be avoided. It is one of the worst planned cities I've ever seen, with heinous traffic and randomly strewn roads creating a chaotic mess(as opposed to NYC, with organized streets and timed lights created a method to the mayhem) Boston did little to please me, and would please few others as well.
