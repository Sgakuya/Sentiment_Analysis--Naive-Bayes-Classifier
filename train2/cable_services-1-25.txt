Horrible customer service. If your cable goes out it means their computer systems are down too and they can't even fix your system nor credit your account accordingly. This has happened to me 2 times a week. I'm switching to RCN, even though they are a smaller name. I've been told directly by TWC that they have too many subscribers than their capabilities.
