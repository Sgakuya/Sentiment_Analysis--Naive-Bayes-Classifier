Mr. Baldwin, it's time to go. Your career is over and the door is wide open for your exit (stage left). One of the great things about the USA is that you don't need an exit visa to leave! I hope you enjoy your new life somewhere far away. LOOKS LIKE YOUR ABUSED WIFE WON'T BE GOING, SHE CAN'T STAND YOU EITHER.
