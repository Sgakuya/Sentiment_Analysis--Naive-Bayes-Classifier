abdul689 is obviously an overfed moron who WISHES to be a celebrity. Affleck stinks, plain and simple. no one even bothers w/his movies unless they are visual blockbusters. wrote a screenplay--yeah right..bet that's 80% Matt Damon, 20% Affleck. let's not forget the famous friends(kevin smith) who financed the thing and got it produces through Miramax. Also Affleck Damon were already pretty bot actors before Good Wil Humping and any studio wouldve made the film for them. Axlrod might not be famous, but i'll bet he/she has worked harder in life than Affleck has
