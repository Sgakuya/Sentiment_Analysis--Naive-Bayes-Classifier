Mere words cannot describe the power of this wondrous book. McCarthy's writing fluctuates between mystical beauty violent poetry, passages demanding to be reread to fully comprehend the majesty of his prose. This book is definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you can stomach the more brutal side of the old west, it is a literary treasure not to be forgotten.
