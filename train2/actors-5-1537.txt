Few actors can make every character they play believeable, and Freeman is one of them. He always lights up the screen yet does so in a subtle manner. One sign of a great screen actor is the skill of capturing the audience's eye. When I watch films like The Shawshank Redemption or Seven, it is Freeman who demands my attention, yet at the same time he is not obtrusive nor a scene-stealer. A simply great actor all around.
