Definitely without a doubt one of the most hardworking actresses around today. She's got excellent taste in her movie choices as well. From big budget films such as The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Hannibal to independents like The Hours, Magnolia, Boogie Nights and The End of the Affair shes proven herself to be equally adept on either side of the spectrum. I've yet to see a really bad or distasteful movie with Julianne Moore in it. All of her roles are contrasting their never the same. Shes easily going to be one of the greats, she'll simply be known for her outstanding hard work and not her private life.
