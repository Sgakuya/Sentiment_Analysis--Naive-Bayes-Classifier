It's not my type of book, but I still give it a 5. That tells you how great it is. In fact, although it's not my favorite book, it is most likely the greatest book I've ever read. It comes off as a short story, yet it's symbolism and theme are so striking and well-done it's brain-boggling. Any other author could not have written a 5000-page book with as much content as this book. That's how much Fitzgerald put between the lines. It's really a shame that he didn't get all the credit he should have when he was alive.
