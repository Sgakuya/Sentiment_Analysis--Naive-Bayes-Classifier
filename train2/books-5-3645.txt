1984, by Geroge Orwell, definitely deserves its place as number 1 on this list. It was so ahead of its time. Its sortof like the paranoids guide to life. Really a book choc-full-o-propoganda but a fun one. The lovable main charecter is by far imperfect. Very powerful stuff. Orwell once again proved himslef a genius.
