Bank of America simply sucks. I have paid over $600 in NSF charges in the past year due to their practice of clearing checks and debits in order of largest amount to smallest rather than by the date of the transaction. I also just deposited a cashiers check for $10K and I can't get half of it for 9 days...why? So they can make interest off the money that should be in my account. As soon as my funds are available, I'm withdrawing it ALL and moving to another bank. I recommend staying far away from Bank of America.
