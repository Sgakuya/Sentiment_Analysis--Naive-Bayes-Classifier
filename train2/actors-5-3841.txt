Due to his versatility..I have to say, he is an excellent actor. From his comedy in Moonlighting to his more recent movies..he has shown an incredible range. Sixth Sense is the icing on the cake for him. He has proven that he can go from comedy, to tough guy, Action hero to sensitive, deeply emotional drama.
