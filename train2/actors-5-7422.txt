He is a great actor! The Rocky movies alone, all five of them qualify him as a great actor! How many other actors write and star in their own films! It's amazing that he did that and at such a young age, he was only thirty years old! He was also good in the First Blood movies, and Cobra! Now that he married model Jennifer Flavin he is a devoted family man! I hope he wins another oscar one day, this one for acting!
