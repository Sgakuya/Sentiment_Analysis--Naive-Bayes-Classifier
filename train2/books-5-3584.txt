Crime and Punishment, another brilliant novel by Dostoevsky. Heavy critiques on morality and crime. Is there a basis for punishment (self perscribed and institutional)? The relationship between conscience (personal guilt) and instilled morality. A man kills an old lady because he is desperate, poor, miserable. Is he wrong? Intellectualy stimulating and packed with philosophic exploration.
