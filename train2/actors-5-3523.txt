Mr. Cage has great acting ability and versitility and is a pleasure to watch regardless of the role he plays. Most importantly, I also commend him on his attitude towards parenthood, it brings tears to my eyes to know there is a man who can be so busy and also make sure he has time to be a dad. This is his greatest accomplishment, there are many men who fail to see this as important!
