This man is alot like Julia Roberts, very overrated! Bleah. He isn't that good looking, and his acting could do a workover in acting school. Most of his movies only succeed because of good supporting actors or actresses. I really don't recommend his work to anyone. He is also known for his rampant homophobia. He seems to think he is a spokesperson for family values I guess. I didn't know showing your bare ass on the big screen was family values? Hmmm...seems hypocritical ! Total Aussie trash ! Gross out...
