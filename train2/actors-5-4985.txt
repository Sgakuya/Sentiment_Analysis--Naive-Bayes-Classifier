How can anyone criticize an actor by the way he looks? I don't do that, but if I was judging Brad Pitt's looks, I'd have to give him a 6 on a scale of 1 to 5. I am judging his acting, however, and I think it is great. I don't know if you guys have seen Seven Years In Tibet , but it was an inspiring movie, and he did a wonderful job in it. In Meet Joe Black , he certaintly made his character funny and believable. Good Day!
