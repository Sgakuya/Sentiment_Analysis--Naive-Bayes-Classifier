Had the 4.0ltr V6 Auto Supercab 4x4. In 40,000 miles it blew the heads twice, radiator once, intake manifold gasket 4 times, tranny twice, rearend once, steering box twice, had to have the master cylinder replaced and 2 brake jobs done, 1 set of tires ( I HATE FIRESTONES!) and during all of this Ford REFUSED to provide me with a rental.
