Truculently stupid, aggressively dumb. Probably most famous for advocating the stoning of Henry Hyde and the murder of his family. Reportedly promised to move out of the US if George Bush was elected and then would not. Add liar to his resume. Someone did move out and it was his wife. Smart girl left the slob.
