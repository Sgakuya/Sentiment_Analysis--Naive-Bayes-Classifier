I would think he's a living legend. One of the few honorable actors of Hollywood. I've liked so many of his movies, even from the 80's...Money Pit, Bachelor Party, Big, Nothing In Common... Could have done w/out Turner & Hooch, tho...and can't forget about his TV show from the early 80's, Bosom Buddies (not his best work, but you win some, you lose some.) I think he's a great actor and has a great personality. Very versatile actor...
