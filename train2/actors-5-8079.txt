Hands down, Katharine Hepburn is my favorite actress of all time. She has had a remarkable career...stage, screen, television, author. So many others pale in comparison. To this day no one has exceeded her in Oscar nominations and wins. Her range as an actress is extraordinary. I adore her films with Spencer Tracy in particular. No matter how many times I have seen Guess Who's Coming to Dinner I still get teary when Tracy makes his speech towards the end of the movie about the love he feels for Christina. You can see him sharing the same sentiment with Hepburn. She has been a well respected actress to this day and will be for many years to come. I came across a quote from Frank Capra that I feel somes it up, There are women and there are women--and then there is Kate. There are actresses and actresses--then there is Hepburn.
