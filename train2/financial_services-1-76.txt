US BANK AND THE BS THEY FEED YOU! TO THE BANK EMPLOYEES-WE DO READ OUR AGREEMENTS, BUT US BANK IS STILL A CRAP BANK! Overdraft fee's were still being assessed to my account after closing it.After one mistake on my account which I did make-US BANK racked up almost $200 in overdraft charges the 1st time. I said it was my mistake and I would pay it. That wasn't the end of it. To this day, I am still trying to figure out how my account which is now closed finally after a 2 week delay has racked up almost $900 in overdraft/late charges. This is now on my credit report and on top of that-I cant open a new checking account anywhere because US bank labeled it Account Abuse. I have talked to the manager of the location several times and he said that US Bank cant do anything. This is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. After much debate with them, I was getting in debt due to my wife health's issue and I had to file a Chapter 13. This was 7 months after the fact. I would like for US Bank to remove the Account abuse and also at least admit to their mistake. I have never seen a company operate the way they do and their 5 star guarantee is a load of hogwash also. I used their ATM a lot and 90% of the time the envelopes were out or they had some type of issue with the ATM at their drive thru location. The one time I really complained they decided to give me the $5.00 in my deposit. The 4 other times were not given to me. No reason or anything. I am just wanting someone out there to be aware of the issue and I am waiting for the civil suit to start. Thanks for listening
