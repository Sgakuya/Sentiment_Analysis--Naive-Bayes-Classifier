Here is an actor with depth and feeling. Plays roles that constantly change him in looks and voice. Great in whatever he does, Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down, Witness Protection, Sins of the Father and many more. A modern day Spencer Tracy or Paul Muni. His portrayal of Lt.Sam Cole on the TV show Robbery Homicide Division has brought him legions of fans. Even though CBS has cancelled the show. It lives on in the hearts and minds of the many fans of the show. We will never let it die. We are determined to bring the show back on the air via our Save Robbery Homicide Divison campaign. We are still petitioning CBS with letters, faxes and emails. We shall continue to do so until they relent and give us, Tom's fans, what we want.
