I have watched Michael J. Fox on t.v. since I was 5 years old. I recently watched the interview that he did with Dateline on 2/12/01. He is a very compassionate man and I wish him and his family the best. My great-grandma had parkinson's, she was a very strong and humorous lady. Thank you Michael for speaking for so many with PD.
