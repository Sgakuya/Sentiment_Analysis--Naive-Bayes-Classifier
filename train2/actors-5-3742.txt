It is so obvious watching Mr. Oldman on screen that he is one of the greatest. Versatile, dark, villinous, sophisticated... He has it all. Whatever film he graces is a hit and whatever actor/actress he stars with is put to shame. It is a true shame that ne does not get the credit nor the attention he deserves. Tk you for your performances -- all of them -- and I hope to be seeing more of you on screen. You are a true actor...
