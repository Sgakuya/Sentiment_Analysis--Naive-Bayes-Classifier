Perhaps Audrey never acted in some deep dramas or tried to be a sex kitten like some Hollywood actresses at the time, but what she did do fit her perfectly. Audrey was like a little wood nymph -- petite and cute, with those big, brown eyes sparkling with mischief. I loved My Fair Lady and Breakfast at Tiffany's. She wasn't the most glamorous actress in Hollywood, but she made her own kind of impression that has stayed on long after her death.
