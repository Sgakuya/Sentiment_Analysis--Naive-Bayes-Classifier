Barbara Stanwyck was another one of those actresses in the mold of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. A tough broad actress, she really knew how act. She did have some terrible roles, but her acting was always the redeeming element. Her best role was by far Double Indemnity with a young Fred MacMurray. She did really well later in television in Death Valley .
