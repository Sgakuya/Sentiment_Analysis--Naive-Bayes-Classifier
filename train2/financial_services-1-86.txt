Let's talk about preditory, excessive overdraft fees. This bank sets up its overdraft program to produce as many fees as is possible. I had one big check to hit my account and cause me to go negative, because funds I was expecting were late. U.S. Bank put that check through first, which automatically put me negative, and THEN put a bunch of little things through that I had enough money to cover. Instead of one overdraft fee, I got ten. I would have gone the same amount negative with the check going in first, or last, the only difference is the amount of revenue created for U.S. Bank.
