Minneapolis may be great, but the airport isn't! I fly NW, and have to make connections there, since I need a wheelchair, I specified it, and there was one waiting for me, but the gates were too far apart, and the wheel chair gal said she couldn't go that far, and I needed a cart, well, before I made it, I had 3 carts and 2 wheel chairs to get me to the gate. Coming back, it was the same thing, only I got to my gate and they were loading, I almost missed my plane. This upsets me, since I need a wheelchair and hard for me to ride the carts. What is wrong with NW, when you ask for a wheel chair, then do it all the way! Has anyone had this problem?
