The Focus not only looks horrendous but from all the recalls issued it must be a nightmare to own too. Never mind the awards. What good are they once the warranty period is over? There's no way the Focus should be rated higher over the Civic and Corolla. Ford sucks. They messed up the Taurus and the Mustang and the quality issues associated with the Focus and Windstar are pitiful to say the least.
