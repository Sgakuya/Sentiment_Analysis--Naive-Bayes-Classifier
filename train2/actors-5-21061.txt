Pam has a beautiful face and a fantastic body (pardon the understatement). She's a fine actress for the roles she plays. She is a sex symbol, not a character actress--doesn't do Masterpiece Theatre. People should stop insulting her for not being a great actress since she serves her niche--sex symbol. She has amazing breasts and legs and lips--simply perfect. She's knocked unfairly for plastic surgery--so what? Don't women have a right to have control over their bodies? She is who she is. I think she's beautiful and don't care if she is enhanced. I like what I see, and she seems comfortable with herself. Some people hate her--ironic, people being jealous of a successful woman and thinking that she has no brains just because of her incredible beauty. She's much smarter than people think. There's a good mind in that beautiful head of hers. I respect her.
