Cingular has the rudest personnel I have ever seen in any company. If you go by their office here, half of their employees will be doing nothing and you will be told to take a number and wait. Their coverage seems to have deteriorated in the last couple of years. The 60 mile stretch of Interstate 20/59 from Tuscaloosa to Birmingham, Alabama is one of the most heavily traveled routes in the country (far in excess of 100,000 vehicles per day) yet there are glaring gaps in reception. We're going to go with another carrier.
