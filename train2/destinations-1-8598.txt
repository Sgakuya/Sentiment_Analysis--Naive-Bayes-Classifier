Copenhagen dipper for 32 years now. Copenhagen was 39 cents a can when I started. It's up to $5.50 at some places here in Texas. So, I've been looking for a cheaper alternative. First up... Grizzly Fine Cut Natural ($1.89 a can). Vile is too weak of a word. I wouldn't buy another can if the price fell to 3 for a dime. I'd rather dip a cat turd !!
