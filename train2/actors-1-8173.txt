As a Iraqi War veteran I am utterly disgusted that a person like this is chosen as a great Woman I fell she is worse than the ememy I was fighting along with my fellow marines and soldiers. At least they let us know they hated us. She quietly slipps to North Vietnam and collaberates with the enemy. It makes me disgusted I defend trash like her. I'm sorry for all the Vietnam Vets that put up with her ANTI-AMERICAN CRAP!
