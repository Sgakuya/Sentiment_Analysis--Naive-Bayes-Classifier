He was tough, he was ugly, and he had dignity. These are the words John Wayne wanted for his epitath, and that pretty much sums him up. A great actor, a great American and my hero. THE QUIET MAN is my favorite movie. It's a shame that he only won one OSCAR, for TRUE GRIT. All of his movies are classics.
