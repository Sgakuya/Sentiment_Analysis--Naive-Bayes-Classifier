Dostoyevsky does a masterful job of creating a steadily increasing sense of unease in this classic story of the battle between mind and morals. Dostoyevsky succeeds in slowly increasing the tension felt by the reader, upping in the ante in every chapter, until finally, the book's protagonist is snapped by the weight of his guilt.
