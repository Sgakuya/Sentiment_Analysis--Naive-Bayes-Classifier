prime example of non-talent Hollywood. was cute 10 years ago but now, not so much. and cute is all she had. stars in nothing but fluff, and the few heavy films she's been in (gangs of ny) she was a fluff member of the cast. is hanging on to her credibility by dating younger men who are culturally popular. but that does it matter? Diaz can walk off into the sunset. she has made tons of money off of us idiots. she'll probably get a sitcom deal in her 40's.
