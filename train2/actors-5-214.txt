One of the greatest old-timey Hollywood stars. Physically imposing and quite convincing in most of his roles. He did pick some bad scripts, but his performances usually rose above mediocre material. Great job in The Killers, Come Back Little Sheba, The Crimson Pirate, From Here to Enternity, The Swimmer.
