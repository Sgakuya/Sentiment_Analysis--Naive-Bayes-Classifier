I'm not a big Kathie Lee fan, but I don't understand the disdain for this woman. She seems nice enough, but many people can't stand her. She is funny, talented, and can sing well. She seems nice. I feel sorry for her for having a lousy, unfaithful husband. She deserves better. She has a beautiful face and a fantastic body. Yet her husband cheats on her. And she was kind enough to forgive the lecher. There are many guys who would love to be in Frank Gifford's place by being with Kathie Lee. She and Regis did well together on TV. And regardless of whether she bores people by talking about her kids (I love my kids and like talking about them, too), she still doesn't deserve such hatred. Just remember that her TV audience consists largely of stay-at-home-mothers who, obviously, are interested in kids. And her role is limiting. She might not be as exciting as Jamie Lee Curtis, Pamela Anderson, Tom Cruise, and Demi Moore, but they are in movies, while she was a talk show host; it's a very confining and limiting role. If she bores you, ignore her, but don't hate her. I think she's a very talented and extremely gorgeous woman!
