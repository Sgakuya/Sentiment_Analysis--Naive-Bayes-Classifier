Think about it...if you didn't have the view of the bay, and the nice weather, you'd think you were in Wheeler, West Virginia...a badly-overpriced Appalachia. Congested, crowded, no green space (except one large park), grafitti and trash everywhere, strange-looking, down-on-their-luck hoboes and homeless, dreary and depressing row houses. $400,000 condominiums. Rudest locals I've met anywhere in the U.S. Ughhhh! San Francisco is the destination equivalent of the emperor who wore no clothes! Why people are so enamoured with it is beyond me.
