I first noticed Christian back in 1987 when he starred in Empire of the Sun. I was 7 when I watched it (will be 21 in June) and have been a balehead ever since. Christian is a very talented actor and good-looking too. I have seen the majority of his films and have enjoyed them. I would have to say all of the films I have seen are favorites because of Christian's acting and other things. I still have not Heart of the Country, A Murder of Quality, The Secret Agent, and All the Little Animals, but I think his acting is most likely very good in them. I cannot walk to see his new films, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Equilibrium, and Reign of Fire. I suggest watching Empire of the Sun, Newsies, Little Women, Velvet Goldmine, Metroland, and American Psycho if you have never seen any of Christian's films, but any film of his should be seen because of his acting ability. Also, a very excellent website to check out is the Official Christian Bale Web Centre run by Harrison (www.christianbale.org).
