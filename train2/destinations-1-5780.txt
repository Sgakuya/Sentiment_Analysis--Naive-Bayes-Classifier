A top destination spot, great beaches, some friendly people in certain areas. I would never live there though, it is waaaaay to hot and humid during summer, and way too touristy. Florida is a great place to visit, but not to live. UPDATE: I HAD IT AT THREE STARS, NOW ITS GOING DOWN TO ONE!!!! YOU LOSERS MADE GEORGE BUSH THE PRESIDENT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: but please let me add to this smart ass mr political guy, that i am not a liberal, i am bipartisant, also, he is a major hater and has some major issues with listenting to other people's OPINIONS, do you not realise that it is an opinion website, get a life, i don't believe in this whole right wing left wing crap, its such a load!
