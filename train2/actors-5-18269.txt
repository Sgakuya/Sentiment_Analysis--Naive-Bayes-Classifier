I wouldn't say all his movies are great, but to deny Stanley Kubrick's due as one of the greatest directors ever would be to deny the truth. A man who brought realism to the silver screen in many frightening portrayals, Kubrick was THE 'shock and awe' director of all-time. Who can forget the disturbing 'A Clockwork Orange' or the sheer madness in 'Full Metal Jacket'? Kubrick was the shock king of cinemadom.
