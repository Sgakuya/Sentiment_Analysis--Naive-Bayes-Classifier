He is an awesome actor. I've really enjoyed his work since his performance in To Die For with Nicole Kidman. His eyes hold so much expression and he is very believeable in everything he does. I think with his latest movies such as Gladiator and Quills and of course being nominated for an oscar this year, he will finally be noticed for the outstanding actor, I've always known him to be.
