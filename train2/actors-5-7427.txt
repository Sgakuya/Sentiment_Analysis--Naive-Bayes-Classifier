Stallone is great. I love all of his films, they are all brilliant. Anyone who wrote all 5 Rocky films and was choreographer for all the fight scenes has got to be recognised as skilled at the least. I know he looks dumb and sounds it but if you ever watch the Rocky Anthology on DVD he is in an interview and he sounds very intelligent.(i know you probably think aye rite but its true)
