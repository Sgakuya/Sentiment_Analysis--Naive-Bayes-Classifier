Uh, Clifton you must be on crack or thinking about Las Vegas....this is Tulsa and trust me it stinks-i live in this crappy town. Moving out of here next year to North Carolina. Btw-there's not a million people here...more like 393,256 might help looking at your info before making comments like that. You might make people mad if they read your remarks and moved here. One last thing-Taxes too high,pitiful mayor,bad schools,horrible roads. If you come into Tulsa on your way somewhere else? take a detour around this stinking place.
