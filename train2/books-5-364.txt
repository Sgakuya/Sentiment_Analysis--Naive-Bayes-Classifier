I am surprised at Nasha's comment..are you so clueless to think this book is for morons (who) enjoy being downsized at at the mercy of corporate America ? Duh, this delightful tale is not simply about business and corporations..get your head out of the sand and open your mind a bit. This is an easy read that you simply cannot put down until you have finished it. It relates to every person in every aspect of life. It is not simply about careers..it is about family, relationships, life in general. Sure, it is basically common sense, but most people seem to forget to look at life through this simple perspective. No matter what you are experiencing, this is a must read. Moving with change instead of fighting it is a skill that everyone needs to learn and accept.
