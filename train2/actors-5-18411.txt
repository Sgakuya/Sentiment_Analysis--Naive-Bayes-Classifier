Haven't seen but about four of his films, but they are awesome. Hidden Fortress was an inspiration for Star Wars, but it's not Kurosawa's best film. Some would say that Seven Samurai is his best, but I don't agree. The best one is Throne of Blood. Set in feudal Japan, it's a retelling of Shakespeare's Macbeth. It is a haunting piece of film-making.
