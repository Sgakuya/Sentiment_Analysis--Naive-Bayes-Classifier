Whatever to do, don't buy a 1995 Ford Windstar. Failing head gasket after head gasket in its awful 3.8 engine resulting in thousands of dollars in repairs, and Ford Motor Co. will not take responsibility and help the THOUSANDS of people with this costly minivan. Customer Service is NOT job one at Ford after all. See cartrackers.com/forums for more info. Class action lawsuit in the works.
