Arnold is one of the greatest actors in this list, and he should be in the top 10 for sure. He can make you laugh, cry, and when he plays the terminator he can make you scream. It took him 20 years to learn how to act, and he was acting in the 70's with movies like Scavenger Hunt and Hercules and New York. And then the 80's with The Terminator. and the 90's with T2, True Lies, Eraser, and Jingle All The Way.
