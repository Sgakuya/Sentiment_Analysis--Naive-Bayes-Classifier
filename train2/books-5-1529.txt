foxtrot is hilarious and despite the heavy censorship of comic strips and the critical readers,it has been funny for 15 years (April tenth it turned fifteen).it didn't sell out and become about profit like garfield or stop after a short period of time like calvin and hobbes, it gets funnier every strip. each strip is different and therefore the comic appeals to people with different senses of humor.it is so cleverly written and each strip I find myself amazed thinking how did he come up with that- that's so creative! each charachter has a personality people can identify with and it never fails to brighten my day. the drawing is unique, too.
