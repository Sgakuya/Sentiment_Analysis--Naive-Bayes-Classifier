Leonardo DiCaprio marches to the beat of a different drummer---he should not be penalized for doing so! His choices to date have bene unique, thought-provoking and brave. He dares to select a project based on its message and artitic merits, not the revenues at the box office. Is that not the sign of the consummate artist? Those of us who have followed his career applaud his ability to focus on the project, not the grosses. His winning performance in Titanic should secure him the opportunity to seek those projects he truly want to do, not those he feels he needs to do. He lights up the screen with his presence and invites us into the magical world of whatever character he embodies--what more could one ask?
