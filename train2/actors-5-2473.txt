i think this man is one of the most underrated actors in the entire moviemaking industry. i definitely think he should take on some more dramas to show off his talent. he can capture the individual essence of each character and still let his sense of humor show through at the same time. plus the fact that he's one of the very few actors in hollywood who can cry on command. now that's really impressive. he possesses a certain charisma that's very attractive. and i don't hear much about him which is good so my image of him doesn't get spoiled. he could become a classic if he really wanted to...
