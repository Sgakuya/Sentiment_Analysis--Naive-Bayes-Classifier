Although I wasn't impressed w/ the movie Sling Blade, I was impressed w/ ability to act in it. He played a great character in it and he directed the film. I can't imagine the stress that he went through. Lets face it, he is a good actor and what happens behind the scenes or in his personal life, is his own. I truly believe that when you are a celebrity you have no life of your own, but that doesn't mean that I agree w/ it.
