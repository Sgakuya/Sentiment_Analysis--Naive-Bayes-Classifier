Simple collision claim from 2005 is still unresolved as of Feb 2006. They finally assigned an appraisal firm that lowballed the ACV and when I tried to negotiate a slightly more realistic value was told that they would stick by the appraisal and send me a check for part of the claim but would withhold the salvage value amount and sales tax amount until they picked up my car and I sent them proof that I had obtained a replacement vehicle......Take it or leave it attitude. Additionally communication is instantaneous when they want your money but takes a few days if it involves a claim. THis is not a 3rd party claim they are my insurer and frustrating beyond belief.
