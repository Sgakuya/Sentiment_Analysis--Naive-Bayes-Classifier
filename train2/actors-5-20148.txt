I love Courteney! I remember her from Cocoon the Return. I watched the movie when I was a little girl and I absolutely loved her character. She was so cute. Then I got to watch her oldest show when she was 21 (can't remember the name in english, sorry) and she really impressed me! After that I watched all her movies. I loved the "Scream" trilogy because of her at first...and Friends that revealed to the world how talented and funny she is. I also saw "3000 miles to Graceland", she was great in it! She can play any character, she can play all the emotions she wants to play!
