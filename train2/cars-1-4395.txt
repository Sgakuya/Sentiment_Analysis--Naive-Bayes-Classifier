I have a '97 ford windstar and its a sour lemon for sure. My engine light stays on the time, runs like crap, and my speedometer went out at 62,000 miles. They want 500.00 for a new speedometer and 500.00 to fix the engine light problem!!! I only have 68,000 miles on it! I really hate this vehical-I'll NEVER own another Ford of any kind!!!!! Unsatisfied windstar owner!
