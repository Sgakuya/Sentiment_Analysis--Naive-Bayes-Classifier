Ted King has it all -- looks, talent, sex appeal, brains -- plus he is a genuinely nice human being. He has the potential to be the next super star of daytime, given the right storyline. But before that happens I am sure primetime or features will snap him up. He was one of the leading two contenders for the playboy surgeon on Nip/Tuck, which he narrowly lost, so I am sure its just a matter of time before he gets a primtime gig. When that happens I will follow him.
