I actually struggled just finishing one of these beers. Beer is supposed to taste like beer and not like food. Just imagine drinking these all night until you're hammered...it's not possible. If you really like sipping a glass of wine or drinking only an occasional beer, this might be O.K. If not, stick to Pilsner or Lager-type beers.
