i have got to be the biggest audrey hepburn fan ever. I draw so much inspiration from her + she will forever be an icon + the most classy, caring, selfless person ever. She did so much for the world, aside from starring in countless wonderful films. Also I just wanted to point out that the little bit of info on her in the top corner is incorrect. Audrey died in 1993, not 1989.
