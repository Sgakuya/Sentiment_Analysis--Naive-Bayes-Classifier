I can unfortunately say that i HATE this guy. His appearance in any movie marks it as an automatic peice of SH T. aside from Forrest Dump which was mildly ok. And he gets worse and worse and worse. cripes that one where he is abandoned on an island....i have made fire....good god. what has film making turned it. He must be heavily involved in the church of scientology to have ever made it with his pathetic abilities. oops, my bad. hes actually on the board of academy awards. hmm HELLO CALLING ALL GULLIBLE IDIOTS.
