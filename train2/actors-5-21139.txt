Lovely, talented, funny, and sensative. The next big breakout! Contrary to some though, I also like Hillary Duff. I feel comparisons are unnecessary. Hillary has her style, and Christy has hers. I find that Anne Hathaway is something of a cross between Christy's elegance and refinement and Hillary's exuberance and joy.
