Ok, I'm kind of confused, are we rating Ali or Sami? Ali is a n awesome actress.She brings such depth to the character she plays. Some times the storylines are so bad, but ALI lightens up the scene. She has great chemisty with Bryan Datillo. She is dedicated to her fans and visits her website and other LUMI (Lucas and Sami) websites often. I'm proud to call my self a fan.
