My B/F and I own the BOMBardier Quest650 and do NOT recommend it to anyone. Sure it's big and powerful and I guess if you don't mind spending hundreds of dollars fixing the #$%@ thing, then you may like it. I don't think there is an inch of this beast that we have not had to patch, fix, replace or repair. We don't do a lot of off roading with it, it's more of a workhorse for us, but it sure is not what we thought it would. Don't waste your time with this P.O.S.....buy a Honda!!
