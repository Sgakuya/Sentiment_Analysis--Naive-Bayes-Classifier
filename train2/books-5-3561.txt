This book was personally helpful for me by bringing me to the end of my secular existentialist studies, since it led me to see that the end of this philosophy is...and I can't say the rest, because it would ruin the book. Ultimately, this book caused me to turn to God for answers, since I realized existentialism's answers were unsatisfactory. The trial is not a pleasant read, though it is well-written and intellectually provocative.
