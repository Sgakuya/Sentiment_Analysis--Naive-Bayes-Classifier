what do the meanest people in america, the dirtiest air in america, the highest debt in america, the least organized city in america, the highest gas prices in america, the worst traffic (even in places other than la)in america, and the most overrated scenery in America all have in common? They are all part of that shallow, materialistic, tacky state of California.
