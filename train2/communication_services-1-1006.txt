I have 6 mobile phones through verizone and the service on the phones in terrific in every way. They stand behind every product without question! However, I had a pager thorugh them and receieved the worst service I have ever experienced. The pager never recieved a call. I called multiple times and they made attempts to repair the problems but it never worked. I will say that they refunded my money in full and I was happy. If you want a mobile phone go to verizone; if yopu want a pager, go any place else.
