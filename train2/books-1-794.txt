All the books are well written, but the theme is ghastly racist, you have an elite, a ravce of elects that look down on 'ordinary mortals', the lonely, unloved child fantasises he or she is a superior being and low mortals are little more than animalsTeach this to a child and you have created a potential serial killer. This is a bit extreme, but I can't but feel the danger is real. Even worse because the books are well written.
