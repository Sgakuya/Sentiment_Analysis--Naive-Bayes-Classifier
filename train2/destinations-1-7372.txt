Paris reminded me alot of American cities. Surrounded by high rise ghettos. Expensive restaurants - good if you can afford it, There are cheaper restaurants where the food is very greasy and seemed like it was always served with steak fries. Of course people in Chicago, New York are alot friendlier, I don't know, maybe it's just me , but Parisians give me the creeps for some reason. Why did I go here ? We won the trip as a company bonus, 1st prize. 2nd prize was Maui. LOL If I had worked a little less I could have been on a beautiful beach instead of walking around in the drizzle and paying 5 Euro for a cup of coffee to sit outside and watch pigeons crap on the sidewalk.
