Ridiculously expensive food, housing travel, clothes, cars, fuel etc. Overcrowded. Collapsing infrastructure. Soaring crime and anti-social behaviour at home and abroad. Warmongering government. Highest illegitimate birth rates in Europe. Highest youth drug rates in Europe.One of the worst environmental records of any developed nation. Life-sucking welfare system. Dirty, heavily littered, polluted. Degraded countryside. Outdated monarchy. Celebrity obsession gone haywire. Yob culture. Materialistic, Status obsessed, class fixated. US sidekick and top target for al Qaeda. Nice place to live!
