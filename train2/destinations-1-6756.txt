Great place if you have lots of money. Playground for the rich. Lived in North Idaho for 45 years. Beautiful country. Can't even get to lakes any more, all private. California land grab going on now. Native Idahoan's can't afford homes any more. Republican strong hold, and you can see the results. Two classes of people, Rich and those who serve the rich. And it gets much worse. Wish I could say something good but there is nothing. Was my home once, now I wake up and don't even recognize were I live Slowy dying in Idaho
