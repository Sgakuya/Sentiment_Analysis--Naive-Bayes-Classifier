If Phillip Seymour Hoffman looked like Tom Cruise, Orlando Bloom or Jude Law he would be a lot more recognised as an actor and unfortunately a lot more appreciated. But by Hollywood standards hes not leading man material which is an awful shame! He's absolutely brilliant if you catch any of his films as a supporting character in Scent of a Woman with Al Pacino, Boogie Nights as Mark Wahlbergs best friend and that absolute tripe film that he still managed to outshine in Cold Mountain, you will see this actors amazing and outstanding talent.
