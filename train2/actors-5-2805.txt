The more I see of Kevin Spacey, the more I think he may be the best actor in the business. His range is unbelievable - from the disillusioned suburbanite in American Beauty, to the abusive boss in Swimming with Sharks, to the cold blooded killer in Seven - this guy can breathe life into any role. I can't wait to see him more movies.
