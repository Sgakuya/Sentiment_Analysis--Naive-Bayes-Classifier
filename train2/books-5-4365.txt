Loved it. I page turner for me. Though definitely not for everyone itz a great work of art. One of the best I've ever read. And I got a 100 A+ on the test I took on it in the 9th grade. I guess it just reeled me right in. My kind of book. I strongly reccomend it to those who like Adventures and mythological fiction.
