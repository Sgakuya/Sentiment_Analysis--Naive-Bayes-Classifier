KeyBank doesn't process debit/credit transactions over the weekend, so you end up with all of your withdrawls listed as "pending." When it finally does go through, they simply deduct the larger purchases first. This way, if you overdraw your account with the last purchase (the largest dollar amount), they can charge you overdraft fees on each smaller, previous transaction (i.e. $31.75 per $2-10 debit, adding up to over $400 in fees, when only one $120 transaction had actually overdrawn the account). IMHO, a horrible bank unless you have enough money to cushion your account so that overdrafts never occur.
