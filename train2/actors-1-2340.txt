Who likes this guy anyways? He's just some pretty boy actor who couldn't find anything better to do with his life. the only decent movie he ever made was what women want, and even then I only went to see it because Helen Hunt was in it. My mom and I have a running argument of who is cuter, Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford? I excited to say that I won the argument.
