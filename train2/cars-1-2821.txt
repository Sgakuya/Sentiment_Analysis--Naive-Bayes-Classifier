to hell with mustangs, i lost respect for them once they did away with the 5.0's. a ws6 trans am or a camaro ss would blow the doors off of a mustang gt and damn near the much more expensive cobra r. although i will admit that the cobra r is a beautiful machine, for the money 390hp is kind of a rip-off
