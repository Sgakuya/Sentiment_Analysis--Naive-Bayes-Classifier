Madeline Kahn is, no doubt about it, the best actress/person/woman that ever lived. She was a great inspiration to many, including myself. She was a very beautiful comical genius and I was devistated upon hearing about her death. She has forever changed my life and I look forward to finally meeting her...much later.
