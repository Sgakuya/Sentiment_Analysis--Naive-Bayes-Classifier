She was, still is, and will always be the screen goddess of all time. Marilyn was more than a pretty face but unfortunately, the pretty face was the only thing many people wanted to see. They did not see, or perhaps did not want to see all the pain and troubles this woman had to endure throughout her life. It's a pity no one saw that and tried to help her before it was too late. It's also a shame that she did not live long enough to become a serious actress, which is what she wanted, because in the Misfits she gave one of her most brilliant performances ever. The motion picture business has not been the same and will never be the same without this woman. Today we have cheap imitations and wannabe's but they are no competition to Marilyn. No other actress has that Marilyn quality. Which is not such a bad thing because I sure as hell would not like to see Marilyn replaced by disposable talent. It's a shame that she is not with us and can't see how much the world still loves her. Long live Marilyn.
