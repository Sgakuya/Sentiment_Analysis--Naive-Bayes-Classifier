He's a good guy, I can tell. He's just some bad luck with a couple of scripts, but his talent was definetly visible in Good Will Hunting . Don't judge the movies (some which were bad movies...) he's been in, but his acting. All and all, it's good. I gotta give it to him. He's got lots of good things about him and very few bad ones. Keep up the good work, Matt! Good Day!
