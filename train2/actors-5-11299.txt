Yes, Christina Ricci will always be remembered for being Wednesday in The Addams Family, but you can't judge her acting simply because you didn't like her hair dyed blond in Sleepy Hollow, it was also blond for The Opposite Of Sex, the directors of both most probably wanted her to do that. She was absolutely outstanding in The Opposite Of Sex, her voiceover was extremely well done and she worked very well with the rest of the cast to make a witty, heart touching film. I'll always think back to her regarding this film as it goes beyond her acting in The Addams Family, after all, she has grown up since then.
