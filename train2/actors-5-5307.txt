He's very intelligent, hilariously funny, and incredibly talented. He has the rare ability to make you laugh one minute and cry the next. There's a vulnerability to him that makes you care about him as a person, not just an actor. Aside from his acting, I also love his singing voice. There's a soulfulness to his voice that touches me everytime I hear him sing. He plays the piano beautifully as well. Robert is truly exceptional.
