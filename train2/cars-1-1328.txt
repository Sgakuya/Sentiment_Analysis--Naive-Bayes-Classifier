2000 1.8T. Great ride, handling. TERRIBLE reliability. Had problems since it was bought new. Over 5K invested into this hunk of junk! Now we're told it needs a NEW engine + Turbo to the tune of 9K! It has less than 60K on it. Missed the recommended 5k oil change ONCE! VW refuses to back up their 100K engine warranty b/c of this. Back to a Toyota/Honda/Nissan. Will never buy a VW again!
