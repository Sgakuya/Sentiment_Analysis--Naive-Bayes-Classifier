Overpriced, to start. If you are doing one of the meals in a microwave, you usually have to take some part out and put it in a regular/toaster oven. So, not very convenient. And even when you've followed all the directions and waited, they aren't all that tasty. For all of that, you've probably consumed a huge amount of calories and fat. SO not worth it.
