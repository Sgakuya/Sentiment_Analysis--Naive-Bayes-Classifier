What an amazing book! Although somewhat depressing it is also very funny at times. I couldn't help but wish Frankie would have a bit of luck. This book truly makes me appreciate what I have (and makes me feel guilty for all I take for granted). This man went through hardships I couldn't even imagine. This book works so well because the story is told through his eyes as it happened. It is a child's view of a harsh world. It was wonderfully written and greatly entertaining. Read this book.
