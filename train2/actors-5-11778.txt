SHE ROCKS. Angelina is the sexiest, most talented, beautiful, kind, exceptional actress in Hollywood. There's not much more I can say! I can only hope to someday be like her, and it is SUCH a compliment for me when people say i look like her. Thank you mom and dad! seriously, though, her acting is amazing (Girl Interrupted anyone?) and she is such an amzing person in her own right. She's overcome so much, and she's such a great person because of it. I hope I meet her before I die...I hope she knows people like me support her and wish her the best. GO ANGIE!! I'll never stop admiring you. She doesn't scare me at all, she is a force to be reckoned with and just because she went thru some things in her past, they are just that HER PAST and anyway she never hurt anyone, or did anything to deserve the cruel, relentless media cosntantly reminding her of her past. We live in the present you jerks! Get over yourselves and start writing about her accomplishments in the present. UNHCR, refugee donations, etc etc etc. She is GORGEOUS, sexy, sultry, intelligent, talented, honest, straightforward,and every other complimentary adjective I can think of. angie, you are a diamond in the rough. I can't wait to see more of her work, we all have much to look forward to. She's a great mother, (Maddox is SO damn cute) god I admire her so much! 5 fuc*in stars for the best actress in Hollywood.
