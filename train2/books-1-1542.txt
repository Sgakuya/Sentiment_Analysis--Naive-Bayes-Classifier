SO overrated. Boring, gaudy, and tedious; not to mention it seems like the cartoonist is ALWAYS on sabbatical, judging the number of repeats that are printed. And what is up with the faux- social commentary ? Nothing is addressed directly; usually the characters go about it through dumb, indirect plot devices or preachy lessons. Get this strip out of my paper!
