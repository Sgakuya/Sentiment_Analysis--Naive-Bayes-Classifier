What the hel kind of a name is Thunderbird for a college? I almost cracked up when I saw that. Thunderbird as a bird - yes. Thunderbird as a car - it works. Thunderbird as a porn star - sure why not. Thunderbird as a nickname for the biggest homo in your elementary school - definetely. But Thunderbird as the name of a college, and from what you people say, a respected college?? Not too sure about that.
