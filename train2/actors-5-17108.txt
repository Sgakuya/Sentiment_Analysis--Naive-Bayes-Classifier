I never liked the character of Carly until Tamara took over the role. Even with bad writing, she makes Carly worth watching. She's an amazing actress. I've even seen her in the film Fallen Arches, and she shows great range. She'll be able to play other parts unlike other actors and actresses I now. She'll have a bright future.
