Maurice Benard is the top actor on television, daytime or nighttime. He has delivered outstanding performances day after day as Sonny Corinthos on General Hospital. With his smoldering sensual looks and intelligent, thoughtful commitment to his craft, he is the best example of the excellence available among the ranks of daytime television. No one excites or involves me more in their performance. He is amazing.
