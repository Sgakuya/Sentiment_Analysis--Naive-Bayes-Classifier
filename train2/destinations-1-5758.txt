I agree with Gator-Bait, the jobs and pay in Florida SUCK BIG TIME! Some people might be fortunate to find something good, but most will come up empty and find competition for what's available very steep. Things are getting very very expensive, some parts of Florida will be like California on a cost of living scale very soon, although salaries won't be California levels. Yeah they say no personal state income tax on individuals but salaries are lower and jobs are less plentiful. If you want to lower your standard of living and don't mind working a job your way over qualified for to make barely enough money to pay the bills, then by all means move here and enjoy it! The only good thing about some parts of Florida is the weather during the winter and the interesting animal and plant life which is disappearing. Developments and ugly cookie cutter houses built on zero lot lines is the norm, malls and strip malls are overkill and people love to eat out on a daily basis. Probably a great place to live 20 years ago.
