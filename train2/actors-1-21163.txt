Every time I see this kid, I think EAT SOMETHING! I feel so bad for her and I keep mistaking her for one of those poor starving kids in India. But apparently, she believes her body is better than everyone else's and I watched her during an interview. She had to be the meanest snobbiest lady in my side of the hemisphere! I've never seen so much attitude and anger!
