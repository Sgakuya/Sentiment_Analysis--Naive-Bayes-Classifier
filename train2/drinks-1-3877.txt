Jack Daniel's is disgusting. A country that produces and reveres a great whiskey like Wild Turkey but loves the mistake that is Jack Daniels totally puzzles me. It's only Americans who think alcohol has to taste bad and that it's a mark of manhood to force down this paint thinner. You could mix it with liquid gold, it would still be worthless.
