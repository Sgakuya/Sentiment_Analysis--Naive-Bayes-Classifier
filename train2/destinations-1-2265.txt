People question Bush's lack of concern over N. Korea, but these same people would likely slag on Bush no matter what he does. N. Korea is not a threat in the same way that Iraq is. NK threatened nuclear action back during Clinton's presdency, and unfortunately NK was bought off. Now, NK is broke again and makes their threats thinking that the US will pay them off again. sorry, not this time; Bush has called their bluff and NK is being exposed for the powerless dictatorship they are. Supposing NK does have nuclear capability, the US still has less to fear from them than from Iraq. You see, there is a little-known nation called China in North Korea's general vicinity. The Chinese don't like the US very much, but even those Communists can't deny that US dollars from Chinese exports are the only thing keeping China economically afloat. Plus, China HATES Korea; it was only a reluctant China acting as an ally of the Soviets who supported N. Korea back during the Korean War. Korea is held in check by the Chinese; Iraq has no neighboring countries capable of holding them in line through intimidation like Korea does. As much as I despise Communists and the Chinese government, they are the reason N. Korea is a non-issue and I thank China for that.
