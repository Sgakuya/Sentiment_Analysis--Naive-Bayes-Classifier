When I first saw the twist at the end of Primal Fear (You'll know what I mean if you've seen it) I was blown away and I couldn't believe how well he'd pulled it off. I've been a huge fan of his work since then, and I think he's brilliant at tugging at the emotional strings of an audience. He's wonderful at playing a loveable doofus type (Death to Smoochy, Everyone Says I love you), and it's impossible not to warm up to him. Then at the same time, he's so good at being dispicable characters that you just want to murder by the end of the film. There is a lot of variety in his work, and I'm always looking forward to his next diverse role
