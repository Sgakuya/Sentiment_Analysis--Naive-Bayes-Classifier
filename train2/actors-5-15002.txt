Dakota fanning is one of the greatest child actors i've ever seen, she does not try to act like an adult she plays in many child movies and is going to, she said once: how i cry in movies i think of my goldfish that died, and my grandma is mentally ill, and one day someone is her family said they couldn't come to her birthday party because she is shaving her legs, wich i think is a total stupid excuse, she just turned 11 4 days ago and if you actually knew anything about her not just her movies that she acts like a child but not in her movies. And i have seen everysingle one of her movies, she has been reading ever since she was 2 thats how she is so good at saying a hard word that she shoudn't know at her age, she is the most talented person i've ever seen
