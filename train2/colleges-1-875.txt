Phoenix online was a total wast of money. The councilors are never available. The teacher for the first class was unfriendly, unprofessional, and unhelpful. When I signed up for the class I was told the one class would only requir 5-10 hours per week. After the class started I was informed that you need to put in 20+ hours per week. That may not be alot of time to someone with no or parttime job but, when you work 80+ hours aweek that 20 hours is just not available. When UOP wants your money they are overly friendly. However, once they have your wallet they could care less about your needs as a student.
