The way you are going to feel about grinnell depends very much on what type of person you are. If you weren't very popular in high school, felt intimidated by peers, and didn't have that much fun - i'll say go for it! Those kind of people are really happy here because 99% of the student body was very miserable in high school. However, if you had fun in high school, partied, enjoyed life, and liked meeting people - stay away from it. There is really no fun at all and I don't think it's worth sacrifizing the best years of your life for knowledge that you can get somewhere else.
