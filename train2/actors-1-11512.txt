Cher is just one more self-absorbed, self- indulgent, overrated, has-been celebrity. It's time that she packed and left the country, but hey, when have people like her kept their promises? On second thought Cher, you can stay, but in the future you need to keep your political pronouncements (sorry about the long word, but you can look it up)to yourself and not use your celebrity standing to boost Hollywood political wackiness. CHER'S POLITICS CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM HER ACTING CAREER. SHE USES HER NAME TO PROMOTE HER POLITICAL VIEWS, SO THEREFORE SHE IS OPEN TO CRITICISM. BY THE WAY IN REFERENCE TO HER ACTING, WHAT HAS SHE DONE LATELY BESIDES THE PERFORMANCE AT SONNY'S FUNERAL?
