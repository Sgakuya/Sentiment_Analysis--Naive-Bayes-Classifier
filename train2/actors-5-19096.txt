Jason was excellent in The Agency as Agent A.B. Stiles and I'm furious at CBS for cancelling such a great show that had so much to offer. I will miss the interaction between Stiles and his on screen partner Terri Lowell (Paige Truco. I watched him on PBS in re-runs of Monarch of the Glenn and loved that Irish accent. I hope he will be in another series soon. Saturday nights will never be the same again.
