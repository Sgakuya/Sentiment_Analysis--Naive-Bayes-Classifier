My favorite movie creator, he didn't really direct all the Star Wars films, only the first one of the original series. However, those films have given me so much pleasure and fun over the years that he deserves my highest praise. He also created the Indiana Jones character, which is lost on a lot of people. SPIELBERG DID NOT CREATE INDIANA JONES---GEORGE LUCAS DID!!!
