I am the original owner of a '98 Grand Cherokee Laredo. It ran great for the first 60,000 miles, but ironically, as soon as the warranty ran out, all hell broke loose. For starters, my doorlocks and dome lights started going on and off randomly while driving, then I went to get out of the drivers side and when I pulled the door handle, it cracked off in my hands, I have leaks in the oil system, and the transmission/transfer case. Now, the newest problem is, the electronics system, when I drive, all of the guages, the radio, power windows, doorlocks, etc. flicker on and off. I got the battery and alternator checked out and they are fine. I will never buy another Jeep vehichle, it seems they built their reputation on the great vehicles they built in the 80's but since then, they suck. In fact, I will never buy another American made car, American quality has got to be the worst in the business. My next purchase will be German or Japanese, where they still care about building a quality product.
