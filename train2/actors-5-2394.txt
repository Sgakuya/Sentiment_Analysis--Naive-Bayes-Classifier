No one is perfect, but if there's anyone out there whose acting is close to perfect, it's Mel Gibson. He shows his great talent when he goes from one character to a totally different one. He was amazing in The Patriot , inspiring in Braveheart , and awesome in What Women Want . Whenever there's a movie out and I don't know if I want to go see it, I just have to see if Mel Gibson is in it to be completely sure. He's a terrific producer! I respect, as well as admire him.
