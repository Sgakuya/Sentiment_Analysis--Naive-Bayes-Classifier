While I think there's something a little dishonest in the story-telling of It's A Wonderful Life and some of Capra's other films, there's no questioning that it is wonderful storytelling. It's my opinion that a century from now, much of what is aestetically hip today will largely be forgotten and students will revel in those bits of 20th century American culture that were quintessentially AMERICAN. In this scenario, I'm betting that Norman Rockwell, the Beach Boys, and Frank Capra will see their stocks rise in coming decades.
