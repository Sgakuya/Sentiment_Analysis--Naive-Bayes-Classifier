We also had to replace the transmission, head gaskets, many sensors, and a bunch of minor repairs. I must agree with just about everyone else on Ford's lack of concern. The way I see it if they knew the was a problem with both the head gaskets and transmissions the should fix everyone's van! Not just the few who made in under 60,000 miles. It's almost as if they knew they would hold out untill at least 60,001 miles. Never again will I buy a Ford nor will any of my family.
