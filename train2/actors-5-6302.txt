Phillippe is a great actor that I truly respect. Here's a guy that trekked 3 hours from his native Delaware to NYC for auditions. Didn't rely on being a Baldwin or a Sheen. He became an actor the hard way; by taking risks, getting lucky, and paying his dues. Ryan gets offered to do big bucks commerical films but turned them down. (Ever since I know what you did last summer, which was his first break) Instead, he goes after independant films that he really believes in. He turned down a role in the Patriot which would launch Heath Ledger into stardom. He also turned down a role as Annakin Skywalker in Star Wars because of the age diffrence between himself and Natalie Portman... Gee Whiz! How many actors in Hollywood would have done that???
