I just don't get it guys. I have been dippin Copehnagen for over 15 years. I recently switched to Copehnagen Black (Bourbon Flavor). I put around 7-8 drops of wild turkey in each tin for that extra flavor. WHY DO YOU GUYS WANT TO DIP CANDY? Apple, berry, vanilla, cherry, mint...I just don't get it. REAL MEN and REAL HARD-CORE DIPPERS dip COPENHAGEN. You will NEVER see Copenhagen Berry, Copenhagen Cherry...the makers of Cope know the deal...REAL MEN WANT COPENHAGEN!!!!
