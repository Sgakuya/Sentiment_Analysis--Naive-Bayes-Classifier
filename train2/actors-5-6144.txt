I fell in love with Kevin when I saw him in Field of Dreams, my all time favorite movie. I love his style. He's quiet and reserved but just beneath lies passion and drive. I live not too far from where he filmed Post Man (Metaline Falls). I wish I could of met him. I hope he wanders this way again. I thought Dances with Wolves was awesome and I have watched all his movies regardless if critics thought it was a flop or not. I have enjoyed them all.
