Awesome book. There are scenes that come to me out of the blue and scare the wits out of me. I can not go into port-o-johns anymore for fear of some sweet treat waiting there for me. It's been a few years since I last read it and I still have nightmares about the aftermath of a plague or war with mass death and destruction.
