I developed a crush on Jodie Foster after watching the movie Little Man Tate , in which she play an over caring mother. I also found that not only she is beautiful, she also has the ability to express her emotions in movies she stars in and im looking forward to watching more of her movies, she needs to star in more light hearted dramas.
