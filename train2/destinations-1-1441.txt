Paris - absolutely filthy. The people - obnoxiously rude. The food - wonderful. Overall, the country stinks (and I thought this long before the recent war). Don't waste your time, energy or money...go to the UK instead, or even the Czech Republic...beautiful country, it's capital of Prague is simply magnificent and is the only major eastern european city to escape any damage during WWII.
