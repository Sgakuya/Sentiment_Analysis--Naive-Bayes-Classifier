Hard to choose between Grant and Stewart as to which would be my favourite all-time classic actor, although Grant is probably JUST in front, since he looked so much like my grandfather who I loved to bits. Grant was charismatic, classy and a true gentleman, unfortunately, they don't make them like him any more!
