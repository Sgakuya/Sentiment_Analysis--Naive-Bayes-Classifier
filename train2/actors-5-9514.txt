I think she is a terrific actress, she is believable in every role she plays.thank goodness someone out there could see she had more ability than The Flying Nun, She was wonderful in Sybil. Places in the Heart , I think she did a great job in her recent role in ER as a manic depressive woman. She is one of those actors that I forget she is acting when she does a role.
