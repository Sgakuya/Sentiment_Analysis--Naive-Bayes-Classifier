Horrible experience! The learning groups mentioned by others are a nightmare if you end up with other members who show up at the 11th hour asking what they should do to contribute to a project that's been in the works for 4 weeks. I had unresponsive teachers including one who praised participants for the wallpaper they used in their postings but ignored the content. Extreme negative reviews of two classes including contact info to discuss were ignored by the administration. In my view the sole purpose of this institution is to collect (exorbitant) tuition.
