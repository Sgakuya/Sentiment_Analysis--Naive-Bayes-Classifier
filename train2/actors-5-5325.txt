Robert is an amazing person! I believe he is the greatest actor of our generation and he is a fabulouse singer as well along with heaps of other talents he has. I really do believe he will get over his addiction, it will take a while obviously sence he has been on them for 30 years (Started when he was six) but he will definatly get there. I believe if you want things bad enough you will get it and Robert wants to stop with the drugs more then ANYTHING so don't diss him, he is doing the best he can!
