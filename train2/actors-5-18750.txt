I cannot believe these ratings. I am not American, and there are o alot of things that disturb me about McDonalds USA. However, there are geniuses unique only to America and these people make America great, not the army, the economy or whatever. People like Jimi Hendrix, De Niro, and you get the picture.Oliver Stone is definitely in this category. It's these people that stop America from being the laughing stock of Europe or Asia in terms of arts or entertaining. Why in Gods name would you rate 1 of your national treasures like that is beyond my understanding. This guy is simply breathtaking, he sometimes is not that convincing, but nobody's perfect. 5 stars minimum!
