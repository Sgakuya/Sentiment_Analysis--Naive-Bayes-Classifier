While this book is far from autobiographical, it does contain many elements of Vonnegut's life. Specifically the Bombing of Dresden as seen throught the eyes of a POW. This novel tells the strange story of Billy Pilgrim, who has become unstuck in time. He travels back and forth thru his life reliving the major points, from his childhood, and time spent as a POW in WWII, to being captured for an alien Zoo on the planet Traflagadore. It is an inresting read, and one of Vonnegut's best works. The explaination of the Subtitle or The Children's Crusade is explained in the introduction. I highly recommend this book.
