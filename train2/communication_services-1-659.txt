My Mom made a mistake of sending in the payment late and our service was cut off, then called them to let them know that the funds were already sent. They said fine and that they would cut the service back on. Three days later they cut it off again with another suspension fee of not the 35.00 that they had told us it would be (the first time.) Our bill came to not 35 for each time, but since we have 3 lines - 3 TIMES 35 = 105 x 2 = 210.00!!!!! I called to reason with them, BUT IT IS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO REASON EVEN THOUGH THEY MESSED UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
