Ted King is just not working for me. I'm not sure how I should feel about alky. The character is pyscho and a stalker. alcazar has spent the past few months following Carly around like some sort of lapdog waiting to lap up her bath water. Ted king hasn't tried to inject any sort of emotion into Lorenzo. Ted King is failing at showing me why on gods green earth I should like his character. Its said when adults can deal with rejection of their favorite Character and take it for what it is an opinion. I don't like Ted Kings acting it sucks deal with it and move on.
