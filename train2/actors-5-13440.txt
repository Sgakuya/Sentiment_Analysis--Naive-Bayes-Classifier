I think Juliette has been fantastic in all the film I have seen her in (Kalifornia, Strange Days, Natural Born Killers etc...). She does seem to be typecasted as the fragile girl with the wild side to her, but for a reason - she's good at it. She is fantastic at singing as well - see her in Strange Days and you'll see what I mean.
