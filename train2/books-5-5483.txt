Not much is known about the early life of Jesus, the Messiah. Other than a short incident in a temple at the age of 11, the bible is silent on the matter. As the new millinium approaches, the powers that be decided that the time was right to change this. They send an angel of the Lord, Raziel, to ressurect Levi bar Alphaeus, who is called Biff (the ancient isrealite slang word for a slap upside the head!), childhood friend of the Messiah, so he can write his gospel and tell the tale. Too bad he is such an A**hole (in the words of Raziel)! What follows is a brilliant piece of comedy that will tickle your funny bone. It is irreverant, illogical, and one hell of a great read. Sure to offend even the least pious among us, and produce laugh out loud reactions. Christopher Moore stakes his claim as the greatest humour author of our age.
