The Fountainhead can hardly be classified as a novel. Its characters are one dimensional, its storyline is strained and unrealistic, and its conflicts are predictable. It is however, a powerful political statement which outlines Rand's radical worldview of individualism. Prepare yourself to be offended prior to reading this book. The worst villains of Rand's world are the social workers - those who do nothing to forward mankind's progress, and who justify the existance of non-achievers. Religion also has no place in this world, as it teaches that man is small and powerless against a higher being. According to Rand, society is advanced by individuals who live to work, and whose personal achievement is their religion. There is no place for charity, there is no place for God, and there is nothing greater than the achievement of man. Beneath all the rhetoric and politics, there are some truly interesting ideas here - whether or not you agree with them.
