THE most amazing and talented woman in film history, PERIOD. Not only that, but all that this woman does for charities...she donate countless amounts of money and time to them. Also, she is genuinely one of the nicest people I have EVER met. (I met her on April 29th, after a play she did in Brooklyn) she was more thna happy to sign an autograph, take a picture and talk to me!!) MERYL STREEP...she is THE greatest!:)
