This is an interesting story for a few reasons. It is one of those books a person can read just once and get the story, but if read and looked into a bit more, another whole meaning comes out of it. It actually has a very strong political message in it. The actions of the children express a story sense of survival of the fittest . It kind of outlines the realities of the way a government works.
