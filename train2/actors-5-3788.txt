I thkin he has one of the best personalities for an actor. I really adore his cute and nice side in the kid and it is sooooo cute!!! He can be sooo nice and have the cutest smile and he seems liek teh guy I'd love to have with me all my life!! I wanna marry him!!! ;) :drool: But!! you would not wanna forget about his tough side like in the movie Armageddon !!! He was rough and tough and he also has an edge like most actors.. I've seen him recently be tough in a movie but I can't quite recall what it was but man he was tough!! I also loved him in the fifth element!!! now that's one movie we all should love!! It's on a par with The Matrix and Moulin Rouge on my list!!! He was sooo awesome it could not possibly fit on this reivew and into my time frame!!! I love his all around great personality.He's funny, Nice,Awesome,Tough, and oh sooo cute!!! He's MY MAN!!! :) :love: :drool: :hug:
