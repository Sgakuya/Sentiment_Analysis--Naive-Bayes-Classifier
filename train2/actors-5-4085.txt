What a great actor. I have always been a big fan of this man. He was great in the Lilies of the Field as a handyman who helped build a chapel for a group of nuns. I loved the movie To Sir With Love about a teacher who taught a group of rough kids to have survival skills for after graduation.I liked the movie Guess Who's coming to Dinner too. He is just a versatile actor. who is good in any role he does.
