A country filled with smelly, arrogant, back-stabbing, snail-eating, cowards with absurd mustaches and unusual amounts of body hair, who have contributed nothing to today's society except for Pepe Le Pew the horny skunk. These people were supposed to be our allies. We've saved their sorry asses on countless occasions and they can't even show us the slightest bit of support. And what's worse is that they try to convince other nations to betray us. Well, I say screw 'em. We need France as an ally about as much as we need Sadam Hussein.
