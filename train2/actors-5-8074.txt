I have seen her in a lot of movies. She does a good job in almost every role she does. She is another actress who has played a lot of strong roles. Which was great since a lot of her movies were in the 30s,40s, 50s. and 60s,I liked her in Little Women, Adams Rib, Guess Whos coming to dinner. She did well in movies with Cary Grant, and Spencer Tracy.Just a good all around actress.
