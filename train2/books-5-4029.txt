Great book. Not the most important book of the century. Not even Orwell's most important book -- my favorite is 'Homage to Catalonia,' which I think hits harder than any of his fiction. Because it's true, and he writes it straight, with limited satire and restrained humor. He goes a little over the top in 'Animal Farm' and '1984.'
