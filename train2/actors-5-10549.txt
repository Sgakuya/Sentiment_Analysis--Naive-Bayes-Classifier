A cute, vibrant actress who is so OSCAR worthy that it is almost scary...Drew Barrymore touches the hearts of so many people when they watch her on screen that it brings tears to my eyes. Her talent overflows into the movie theatre everytime I see her on the big screen. (ok, ok that might be a little dramatic, but she is damn good!) A living legend with endless talent...and a very good role model. I wish her so much luck in the future...
