this is mature stephen king. it's just a ghost story. from the beginning, there is something running just beneath the surface of this book, and the reader, i think, senses it, but i like how King doesn't give everything away all at once. He gives a hint here and there and it is a confusing book, at times, but very satisfying. Great for a summer in the sun book, especially if you have a cabin on a lake ;)
