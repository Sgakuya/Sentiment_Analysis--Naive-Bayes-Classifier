To me, Eckel strikes a proper balance between an introduction geared towards new users, and going into enough depth so that once you've gotten into the book, you can accomplish relatively sophisticated tasks. Similar in structure to his very popular i Thinking in C++ /i . I especially like the fact that he addresses issues beyond the merely technical -- he infuses his account with a sense that programmers have a responsibility to ply their trade with care.
