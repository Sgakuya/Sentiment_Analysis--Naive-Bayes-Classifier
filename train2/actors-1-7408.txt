What a liberal jackass. He seems to be suffering from the delusion that he is some kind of a politician. Sure, he can protest and get arrested, but so can the rest of us. I read today that he was campaiging with Janet Reno in California, for her gubenatorial race. What a joke. Hey Martin, just because you portray a president, it doesn't make you one. You've got a long, long way to go. Time to retire.
