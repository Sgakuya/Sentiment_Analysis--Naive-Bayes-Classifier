I agree that NY is overrated. I think it is a fun place to visit, but living there is a whole other thing. It seems that the city is too commercial, and I am sick of every single movie taking place in NY. There is more to the country you know. I personnaly like Boston better than NY, it has a lot more character and charm than NY. And the people seem nicer. The NY population seem arrogant and pompous. Im not saying all of them are that way, but the few Ive met have. Overall, nice vacation spot. But thats all.
