NexHELL is the worst phone company on the face of the planet. I called customer service and was on the phone with them for over and hour and Talked to 11 different people. They transfered me to Corporate and corporate transfered me back. I HATE nextel if there is anything I wish I never did, Nextel is number one on the list. My phone doesn't work anywhere, even outside. I can't call my own voicemail to retrieve messages ,and my friends keep telling me that some chinese man is on my message. I hate them and am stuck for ever. DO NOT GET CAUGHT IN NEXTEL HELL
