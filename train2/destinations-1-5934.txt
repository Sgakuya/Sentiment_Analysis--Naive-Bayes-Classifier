The state has much natural beauty- recreational options are endless- unless you like to sun bathe- or play golf six months of the year-look elsewhere then. Too knee jerk republican-considering the giant amount of federal aid this state recieves. Last frontier-perhaps, but the people are more dependent on the Federal dole then any blue state. What a joke.
