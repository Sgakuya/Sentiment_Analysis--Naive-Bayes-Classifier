I came here 4 years ago for my job and was very excited, but it soon faded. This city has smog, horrible traffic, and unfriendly people. Southern Hospitality is surface-deep at best. And the weather sucks...not only are summers oppressive but winters are surprisingly cold, damp, and chilly. I've never had any trouble making friends in any of the places I've lived but after 4 years, haven't met a single decent person here. Unless you like pretentious, uppity, stuffy, snotty, material-obsessed, SUV driving yuppies or homeless street thugs selling crack, avoid this city like the plague. The second I can get out of this job, I'm packing up and moving back to New Orleans, New York, or California.
