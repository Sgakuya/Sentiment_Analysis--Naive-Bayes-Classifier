I think that Heath has great potential for becoming another Tom Cruise, not that I'm comparing them, each actor is different in their own special way and the Heath acts is quite special, it's a different sort of and I have never seen a comparisan, not even close to the way he is on the screen. He has this amazing stage presence and it is so amazing the way he can be dramatic, funnny, tough looking but kind and tons more so it's quite obvious that he is my favorite actor there isn't as much young talent as there was in my parents time, in other words, a long time ago (sorry Mom and Dad) but Heath defintly is a gem and could become even more well known then Tom Cruise and Bruce Willis even before the peak of his career. He is so cool, i just know that I would keel over if he even said hi to me I hope that he will keep on acting for many years to come.
