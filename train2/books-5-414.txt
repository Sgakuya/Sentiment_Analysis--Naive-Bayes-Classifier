Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is only the first in a great series. I read them first when I was about 12 but have read them many times since and find something new each time around. The books have numerous layers, offering something for everyone. My favourite was probably Voyage of the Dawn Treader, but The Last Battle had some very powerful writing.
