You'll have to pardon me if I go a little overboard here, but this woman is simply stunning. It's hard to tell if her acting ability really deserves five stars, because when I'm watching her I'm too distracted to really concentrate. As soon as she comes on the screen and starts talking in that amazing accent, I start feeling a little woozy. If a movie calls for a character so alluring that she completely destroys the judgment and rationality of the men around her, I think Ms. Marceau is your best bet. Wow.
