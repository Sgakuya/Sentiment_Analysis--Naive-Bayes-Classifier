I think Matthew Mcconaughey is sooo sexy!!!!! i want him so bad! i have 98 pics of him saved and i 'm still lookin for more! he is also my background on my screen. the first time i saw him was in dazed and confused and i didn't think he was all that good looking cept for his body! but then i saw previews for the wedding planner and i've been hooked ever since then!! mmmmm i love him!! but i don't understand why he shaves his head cause i think his best feature is his gorgeous blonde curly hair!I think his acting is great as well! he is very talented!
