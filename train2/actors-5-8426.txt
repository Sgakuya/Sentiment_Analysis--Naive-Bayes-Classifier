Umm...the most beautiful woman to ever grace this Earth. Beauty on the inside, beauty on the outside. Her ghost is chasing me, you know. It seems whenever I turn on the t.v. there's some biography about her, more and more I've seen pictures of her on news websites and such that wouldn't usually have pictures of her. I'm flattered. But then again, her lousy husband Dimaggio wasn't the most attractive guy, either. Marilyn Monroe is lovable and beautiful.
