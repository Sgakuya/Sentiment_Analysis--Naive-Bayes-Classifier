This was the first book that I read of Stephen Kings. It blew me away! If you have not read this book you are missing out on so much! The characters are so well developed. Carrie White is a character that will always stick with me. One word to sum this book up: MASTERPICE! I would also like to add that I admire Stephen King as a writer--not as a person, and DEFINETLY not as a Red Sox Fan!
