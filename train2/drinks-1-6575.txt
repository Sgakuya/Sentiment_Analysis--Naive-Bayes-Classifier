This is the worst soda made Oh wait, no, DIET Moxie is. Honestly, this is incredibly bad. I bring it to the office after a trip just to show people how bad soda can be. You have to be a true New Englander to love it. It is an acquired taste. Yeah, right. This is bad. Where is the poison label?? AVOID THIS EXCEPT AS PAINT REMOVER!
