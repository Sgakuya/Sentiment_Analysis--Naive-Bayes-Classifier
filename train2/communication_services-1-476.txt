AFTER HAVING OVER 2 YEARS OF GOOD SERVICE, WE GOT A BILL FOR $550.00, BECAUSE THEY TOOK OUR FAMILY PLAN OF 5 PHONES AND PUT THEM ON SEPARATE PLANS, THEREFORE WE WERE OVERCHARGED $408.00. WE MADE MANY ATTEMPS TO GET THIS CORRECTED, BUT HAD NO LUCK. THEY SUSPENDED OUR SERVICE 3 MONTHS IN A ROW, THEN CHARGED US $1000.00 ($200.00 PER PHONE) BECAUSE EARLY DISCONNECT PENALTY, TRUTH IS, WE DIDN'T DISCONNECT! WE JUST WANTED OUR CREDIT!
