This is a great fable about how easy it is for evil to dominate us when we even momentarily turn back from the upward path. The gimmick of the potion that allows the end result of such irresponsibility to be clearly seen, i.e., Mr Hyde, is contrived but the point is the moral not the method. A fabulous tale!
