He is great and plays such over the top characters, but sometimes I can't help but feel I'm just watching Al Pacino, as opposed to the character that was written into the script. Maybe thatt's the price of fame and a little typecasting. But he's given some terrific committed performances, like the Devil's Advocate, Scent of a Woman, Dog Day Afternoon.
