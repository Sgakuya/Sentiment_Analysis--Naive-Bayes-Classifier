I have only tried the FF parliaments, and I hated them. They were way too strong. I think they are even stronger than Camels. If you like really really strong cigarettes, you should try these. I am normally a lights smoker, so maybe I'd like the lights if I tried them. The recessed filter is cool, but makes them even stronger. On a certain occasion which I won't mention, my friends and I smoke these cause they are SO strong.
