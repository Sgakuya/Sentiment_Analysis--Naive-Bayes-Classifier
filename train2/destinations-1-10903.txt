I've been to them all and once you have been to Kings Island then you will never ever again say that Disney World is a better amusement park. A bigger AMUSEMENT PARK yes but a better one ? NO ! Kings Island has more RIDES than anyother amusement park. Disney has more THEME ATTRACTIONS than anyother park but pales in comparison to both Kings Island and Cedar Point when it comes down to rides.
