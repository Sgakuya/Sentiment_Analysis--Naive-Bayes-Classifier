Kevin Spacey has pretty much always been in my top 5 and I really don't see him leaving his post anytime soon. Why I believe he is a great actor....because in the majority of all his films, I try to picture someone else in the part and just cannot do it. I mean when he loathes someone, he truly and whole-heartedly loathes them. If he wants you to have a miserable life, you will definitely be in misery. Yes, American Beauty wasn't conventional but I loved him in it and couldn't help but love the movie. One minute he is tongue-tied and drooling over a teenager and the next he black-mailing his boss with all of the confidence of a made man. And no one, absolutely no one else on the face of this earth could be Verbal Kint.
