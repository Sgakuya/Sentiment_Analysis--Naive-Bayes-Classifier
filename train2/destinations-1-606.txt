Sucks. After visiting Jamaica, I was willing to join politics just to one day have a position where I could blow it up. The only thing that country produced worth a damn is Bob Marley. I don't like the city, the country, or the s**tty people there. The government needs to do something about shutting down the itinerants and indigents on the streets.
