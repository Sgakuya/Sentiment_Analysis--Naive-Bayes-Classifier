Denzel is one of the greatest actors of our time. His performances are always powerful and dedicated. I would never miss any of his movies they are truly works of art. I respect and admire Denzel for his honesty and integrity, the lengths he obviously goes to, to care for his family - which appears to be a rare value many of the high profile, high risk actors have today. God bless Denzel and his loved ones. With love and blessings!
