Sean Connery has been around since the 60's film-wise and is still going strong. He'll always be known as the best Bond (lets face it, he is a very cool cat) but has done other great things like The Hill and Indiana Jones The Last Crusade (Sean Connery Harrison Ford - what a great combination!) Who cares how old he is, he's talented, extremely goodlooking and has the most sexiest voice ever.
