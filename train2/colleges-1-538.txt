This school is very expensive for out-of-state students and the class ratio is horrible. UM College Park has over 25,000 students. If you are looking to just sit in your class and hear the professors "yap" than this is the college for you, but if you want interaction with your professors, I suggest a smaller school. UM College Park is a complete waste of my time and money. Just my two cents. Of course, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
