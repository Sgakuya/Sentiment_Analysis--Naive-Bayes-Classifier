I see a lot of terrible ratings for this school. Unfortunately, not many of the terrible raters left comments. Probably because they were so sick of the school, they didn't dare bring back the memories. This school is a joke, a total sleeper school. Challenging classes? Maybe at the elementary school two streets north of campus. Campus? Oh! That's what that's supposed to be? It was usually a bedroom to about 15 bums. That might be an exaggeration, sometimes you couldn't tell the difference between student and bum. Unless you're an art freak, you will hate this place. And if you're a guy, it'll be easier for you to get a man than a woman.
