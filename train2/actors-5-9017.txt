Who care about her politics! I'm a conservative and I think she is the finest actress alive. For example, In HBO's Angels in America there was a scene with a little old rabbi giving a eulogy at a funeral. When I read the credits and saw that the little old rabbi was none other than Meryl Streep! Well you could have knocked me over with a feather. She was so convincing! She's the best bar none.
