Megan Mullary is the star of Will & Grace. She does a very good job in playing Ditzy Karen. I love her crazy relationship with Jack and her fights with Rosario the maid. My favorite moment is when Karen made out with her arch-rival's dad. To liddlebopeep: Hello! Megan's annoying voice is an act. She has a nice voice in real life
