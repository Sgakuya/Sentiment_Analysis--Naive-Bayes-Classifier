It is really a shame to see this actress rated so low (75th currently). At least half of those ahead of her are not only half as talented but many of them are half as beautiful. Several of the actresses ahead of Dunaway are great as well but there are not 74 actresses currently doing movies today that are better. I cannot imagine there are 20 on this list that are better or have the vast body of work on their resume. An Academy Award winner and three time nominee. An Emmy winner and has her name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The dumbing down of america continues...
