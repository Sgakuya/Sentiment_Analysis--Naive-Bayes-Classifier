These people have no idea about customer service whatsoever. Every time I've called them, it's a different story, a different policy, a different suggestion. I have received nothing but the run-around from these people. Grab a clue already! They are the worst cellular company on the market today and I would never recommend my friends or family to them. I'm regretting even giving them a one-star rating.
