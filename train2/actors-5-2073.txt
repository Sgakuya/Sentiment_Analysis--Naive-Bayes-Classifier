This is one tremendous actor. He is completely wonderful at what he does. I was so scared after seeing his performance in Silence of the Lambs that I checked under my bed and behind the shower curtain for a week---just to make sure he wasn't there. Okay, I'm crazy, but if an actor can make you do that, then he must be great!
