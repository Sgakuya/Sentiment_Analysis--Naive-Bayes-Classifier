Fee this fee that....they have more fee's than the IRS. And god forbid you ever have an overdraft...the snowball effect is horriable...then lets talk about excessive check holds....they held funds on my Tax return check for 7 days...what goverment checks are no good....then there was the deposit that they lost...thank god I had the reciept...and that produced over 400 in overdraft fees and bounced checks and it took me 3 weeks to get them to credit my account back and to send letters to the people I had written checks to...I at least want to be kissed if I am going to be screwed.
