I don't know why everyone is making such a big deal about the sex scene in Monsters Ball between herself and Billy Bob. Heath Ledgers character shot himself to death in his own home in front of his Grandfather and his Father and no-one made a big deal out of that and to me that was horrific. Whenever a sex scene comes on we get all embarressed, but we can sit through a violent death on screen where someone can blow there brains out and not say a word or bat an eyelid. I have nothing but absolute and utter respect for this woman. She did a good job and she knows what shes doing.
