A great Steinbeck book, Steinbeck captures the human spirit yet again. This book is very good and very sad, as it follows a family kicked out of the Dust Bowl looking for new hope in California. Their path meets a lot of resistance and the characters are portrayed wonderfully. Steinbeck throws in some symbolic chapters every once in a while that don't relate to the story at all. The book's end leaves something amiss.
