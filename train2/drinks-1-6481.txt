I've never tried drinking anti-freeze, but I imagine that it would taste exactly like Tab. Tab has a very strong chemical odor and flavor, and the aftertaste is horrendous. I suppose it's still available because older people who started drinking it in the '60s (and never moved on to the superior diet colas of modern times) create a demand for it. Come to think of it, I haven't seen anyone drink Tab in at least 25 years. That says something, don't you think?
