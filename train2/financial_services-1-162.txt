Initially my experience with Citizens Bank (Boston) was fairly positive- lots of locations, on the SUM network, etc, but after banking there for about a month, they managed to lose a $1200 deposit of mine. This led to endless games of phone tag with their various offices and many trips in to my local branch (where I invariably had to wait for extensive periods of time). This lasted ofr over a month before they finally realized the error and credited my account with the $1200, but after an experience like that, I immediately closed my account. Even after everything I'd been through, the woman who processed closing my account was still rather rude and told me that I was being unreasonble because it was just a mistake and mistakes happen everywhere . Worst bank I've ever banked with. Since leaving Citizens about a year ago I've been with Wainwright and I've had nothing but good experiences.
