This guy is a mystery to me. I guess you really have to understand his humor to like him. I don't like his humor at all. He is pretty much the same kind of person in every movie, same emotions, same facial expressions...everything. And it's so sad. He was in some promising movies (Truman Show, Bruce Almighty etc)and I enjoyed everything in the movie but him. I don't like him as an actor or as a person. He is way too much in love with himself.
