He projected a combination of thoughtfulness, intelligence, integrity and modesty in his roles better than most actors. His apparent coldness at times resulted from the seriousness of moral purpose he portrayed. Interestingly, while he may never have been a top box-office star, he gradually became recognized as one of America's greatest and most durable actors, with roles which would eventually become legendary in The Grapes of Wrath, The Ox-Bow Incident, My Darling Clementine, Mister Roberts, 12 Angry Men and Fail Safe, among the best. He was also magnificent in one of his rare negative roles, as a sadistic, cold-eyed villain in Once Upon a Time in the West.
