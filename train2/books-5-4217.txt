JD Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is one of the heights of great literature. Through the turmoil of Holden Caulfield, the reader inadvertently gains a broader, deeper understanding of himself. This is the novel which turned me on the all literature and first inspired me to live a better life, which is quite a feat for a couple hundred pieces of paper to accomplish.
