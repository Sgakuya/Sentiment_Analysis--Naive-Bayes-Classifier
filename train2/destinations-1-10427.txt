I use to smoke Newports, and got bronchitis every 6 months. I could've timed it from when I started smoking Newports to when I stopped, I kidd you not, every six months on the dot. I do smoke menthols (although I'm trying to quit), and am a light smoker (5-6 cigarettes a day). Personally, I wouldn't give any cigarette brand five stars - but I avoid Newports like the plague.
