I don't even think I've ever had one of these but I don't want to after having seen way to many of their moronic dubbed commercials. Aw shucks I sat on a freshly painted white bench in my nice new navy suit! Wait I'll just pop a Mentos into my mouth and then lie down on the bench and turn this suit into a pinstripe I wish I could laugh at these commercials if only I believed they were trying to be ridiculous. I think I rather eat good old rock candy.
