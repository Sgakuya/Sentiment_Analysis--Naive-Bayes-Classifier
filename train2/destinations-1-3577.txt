If you in the suburbs of any city and enjoy it than you will love Minneapolis/St.Paul. Unlike Denver and Cleveland which feel more urban, Minneapolis/St.Paul feels like a suburb, they have cookie-cutter low-quality brand-new homes right in the downtown of Minneapolis (LOL). Minneapolis is perhaps, the most boring big city in America. Minneapolis is very unfriendly, if you dont fit the middle-class, soccer-mom stereotype dont go to conservative Minneapolis. All and all, the economy is fairly good, the crime is lower than most big cities, but be prepared to be bored.
