When I first heard about Ellen Degeneres dating Anne Heche, I thought: "Anne who?" She was a nobody before she met Ellen. And as they both tell the story, Anne approached Ellen at the Oscar party they met at, not the other way around. I suppose Steve Martin wasn't enough in the media and/or refused to give her a career boost. I'll bet it was her idea for Ellen to come out on TV, as well. Hey, did anybody notice back then that, on all the photos where she was featured next to Ellen "just as her girl-friend" it was Anne who was the first to stick her face towards the camera and pull a huge phoney grin? Some photos even look like she actually shoved Ellen a bit aside so she could be more in the center of the photos. I have two words for people like Anne Heche: Hypocritical Bitch. She never was lesbian, it just served her purposes. Just go to the IMDB website and have a look at the lousy jobs she had before meeting Ellen, and what kind of jobs she got *after* her public (her choice, I'M sure) affair with Ellen. Anne Heche is a lousy actress and a conniving, heartless bitch. Boycott her movies - mean people should not be encouraged.
