There is no comparison between Jess Walton and Brenda Dickson, the original Jill. Brenda had it all, she was sexy, yet vulnerable. She could portray a myriad of emotions. Jess reminds me of a man in drag and maintains the same affect day after day in tired style. The character development of Jill came to a screeching halt when Jess took over the part. Even Deborah Adair would have been better. There are still many people out there that remember Brenda Dickson and still hope that someday she'll return to the part that was written for her.
