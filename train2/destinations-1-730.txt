In addition to fearing for my life, I had a terrible time in Panama City 15 years ago. There wasn't much to do there, and I was concerned about safety the entire time. Money was stolen from my hotel room, and a friend of mine was robbed twice on the street. At one point, a kind policeman approached and recommended that we leave the area because it was unsafe for tourists. Seeing the Panama Canal was interesting, but it certainly wasn't worth the anxiety.
