i wasn't really aware of tommy lee jones until i saw the fugitive when he just blew me away with him performance. then i couldn't get enough with his stream of roles that came afterward, especially the vain lawer in the client and the ruthless bad guy in under seige. and can't forget of course how he kept a straight face all the way through men in black.
