I am one of the many victims of faulty 3.8 liter engine. I incurred a bill of $4,000.00 to replace the engine completely and Im not happy. My car had less than 70,000 miles on it and with no fore warning it went. Ford is well aware of this defective engine and has done nothing to assist Windstar owners. Its about time Ford realizes their mistake and takes corrective action to help all of the owners who are at a major loss.
