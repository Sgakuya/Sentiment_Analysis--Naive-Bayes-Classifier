Finally, i think, she's landed herself in a role that is very testing towards her abilities. I think one can expect a lot from 'Chicago'. If Nicole Kidman can do Moulin Rouge, Catherine can definitely do Chicago. I've heard that the trailer can make you swoon!! She was damn good in The Mask Of Zorro, Traffic, and America's Sweethearts. The Haunting, Entrapment, and The Phantom (which was disgusting, by the way) didn't add much to her repertoire. I think soon we'll see her winning an Oscar. She's definitely capable, but needs a good, character role. Hopefully Chicago will be the one movie to take her to the top!
