I think if certain people really understood acting or the character of Jason, they would understand Steve's expressions and personality. Steve Burton is a fantastic actor who easily became the new Jason..who is a heck of a lot more exciting than Jason was before the accident. I dont know what u people consider to be good acting. But just remember, actors only get nominated for Emmys if they are truly talented...and Steve is one of them! So get a clue please!
