My family has owned some junk, but this is certainly the most expensive. We've had our 99 for about a year and have had to change spark plug wires twice. I've had my other car for 5 years and never had to do that. The guy at the dealership said that's normal with these. Huh? If Chrysler wanted to build a piece of crap, they sure did a good job.
