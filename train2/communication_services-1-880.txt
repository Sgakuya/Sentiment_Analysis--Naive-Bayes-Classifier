AVOID THIS COMPANY. At first it was great with plan one with 10cents a minute offpeak and 12 cents peak. However they changed their plan just recently to 10cents per day charge. They also completely changed their plan2 to 39cents a day charge with 7.9cents everywhere. PLANNING ON FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE FCC. Since you can't check your call balance they seem to be skimming or charging more than they should
