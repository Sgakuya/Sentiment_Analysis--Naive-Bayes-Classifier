I think Leonardo is a wonderful actor who can make you feel like you are right there with him in any of his movie scenes. His acting in BasketBall Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape is just superb. He's an actor who can make you laugh with him or cry with him and just feel all of the emotions he's able to portray.
