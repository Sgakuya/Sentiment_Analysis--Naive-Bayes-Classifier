Bought a 1995 Windstar, brand new, from Dealer. Replaced transmission at 67,000 miles, only three years old but warranty up. Replaced head gaskets 11/99 at 84,000 miles. Power windows and locks failed or failing. Replaced brakes and starter, ALREADY! I have never been so disappointed in a vehicle, EVER! Unfortunately, it is now paid for, and I can not afford to get a new vehicle at this time. Thought it would last longer then 5 years. We made a big mistake purchasing this vehicle and Ford is making a larger one by not paying for the defected materials put into this van.
