The life of Paul Erdos has largely escaped many of the people who are deeply interested in pure mathematics, especially number theory. Paul Erdos was a mathematician unlike most others. He did very important work not only in the early part of his life, but also the later stages. His love for mathematics and apathetic behavior towards social graces are all vividly portrayed in this book. It's a really great book to have.
