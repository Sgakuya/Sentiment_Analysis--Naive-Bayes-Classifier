A beautiful, magnificent, brave actress willing to defy Hollywood conventions and yet still emerge as an icon. Titanic has its share of critics, but I think she's the best thing in it. See her as well in Heavenly Creatures (shattering), Sense Sensibility (exquisite), and Hideous Kinky (disturbing). She's in a class all her own.
