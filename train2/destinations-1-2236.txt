We Australians can't really point the finger at anyone for playing political football with people's lives. We do it with sea-borne refugees. But I am watching the humanitarian disaster unfold in Zimbabwe with disgust. The government of that country plays political football with it's own people - six million of them. Policies of rapid de-colonialisation never work. And quite apart from the injury and injustice done to white-skinned former-citizens of Zimabwe, now millions more black-skinned people are going to die of starvation or in wars partly caused by the already critical food shortages. This is international political correctness at its gruesome best.
