Indiana is place for the stupid, hicks, people born without taste buds, ugly women, anti-woman, anti-minority except Hispanic and Slovic. The weather is mixture of the north pole and louisana, has no technology, everybody is divorced with kids, no clubs just barrs, country music, dead trees, mutant weeds, algae ponds, fishing and shooting. the total opposite of the beautiful West Coast.
