Have been trying to get billing problem resolved for 6 months, starting the month after subscribing. Customer service is rude and unresponsive. Forget about asking to talk to a customer service manager. Was able to get a apology after a call to corporate office, but the problem continues. They have been adding calls to our bill since July, for a number we have never called. For 6 months, they send an incorrect bill, refuse to pay, and they adjust the bill amount for the error. Then we repeat this process again the next month. Instead of finding and resolving the root cause, they have changed the phone number and replaced the phone itself. This is not a cloned phone problem. Last conversation the support rep. said this problem was happening with several accounts. If that is the case, why would anyone subscribe to their service. We have asked to be released from the 2 year contract and cancel the service, but no luck so far. STAY AWAY FROM CELLULAR ONE AND DOBSON CELLULAR! LET ME REPEAT, STAY AWAY FROM CELLULAR ONE AND DOBSON CELLULAR.
