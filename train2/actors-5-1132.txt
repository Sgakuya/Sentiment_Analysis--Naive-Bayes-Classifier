He is a GRAND actor! He is my ABSOLUTE favorite actor. He makes all of his movies come to life. In fact, he is my role model. He was born from a city close to mine, and went through the same life I did. He never failed to make his movies excellent, and I DEFINETLY DO NOT see how anyone can say he is a bad actor (or am I hearing more jealous people out there?) He really did a fantastic job in Cast Away, and I think he deserved that Oscar more than that butthead Russel Crowe. (although he already won too many awards or it) He is also a good voice actor as well.
