Everyone (well, except the Greenbush twins) did an absolutely great job on Little House on the Prairie, but one person stood out among the rest, and that was Melissa Sue Anderson, who played the role of Mary Ingalls. She excelled at the deeply emotional scenes, and did an especially beautiful job playing Mary after the character went blind. Now that's talent for you.
