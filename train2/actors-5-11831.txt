This woman is an entertainer! She was awesome in Girl, Interrupted, and won the Oscar rightfully so. She was mesmerizing in her performance as a sociopath. What's even cooler about her is the way she acts in real life- HELLO! First, she's kissing her brother on the mouth at the Golden Globes and Oscars, then professes her love for the brother onstage in front of millions- weeeeeoooo!! Then she goes and marries Billy Bob Thornton. These two could win the award for Weirdest Couple. I heard they signed their wedding contract in blood, and that they keep a human skull in their living room. I wonder if Angie's dear ol' brother is jealous of Billy Bob. Then I look at Jon Voight and think, how can such a normal man be part of such a family of oddballs. But hey, it's Hollywood and it's fun!
