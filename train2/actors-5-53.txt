James Stewart mastered his everyman roles with a rare brilliance. His lines never sounded rehearsed. In real life he was known as a genuinely nice person. My stepfather, a airplane mechanic in California at the time, remembered Stewart, whose plane he worked on from time to time, as polite and personable and never condescending to the workers. My favorite Jimmy Stewart films are Harvey and Mr. Hobb's Vacation.
