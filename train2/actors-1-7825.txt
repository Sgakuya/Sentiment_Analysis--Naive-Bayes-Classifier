Once not too bad looking, Mr. Baldwin has grown jowly and fat over the years. Unfortunately for him he also is on the low end of the acting ability scale. Don't believe me? Just catch his recent act in Pearl Harbor - what a one-dimensional cartoon! The above reasons, combined with his convoluted political opinions that he never seems to grow tired of hacking up at every opportunity (described so well and amusingly by abichar1882) give me no other honest alternative than to give him a very well earned one star. He now joins the likes of Ted Kennedy for having outlived his usefulness .
