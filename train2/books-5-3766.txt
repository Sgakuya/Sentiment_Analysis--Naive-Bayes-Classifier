As a foreigner, I found it to be a beautiful and chilling introduction to the culture and racism of southern american states. It is a masterpiece of character development as well as idiomatic dialogue. 8 years after I read it, this was the book that tore my younger sister away from the TV for the first time, a fact that speaks for itself. A child of the MTV generation was engaged by the story, decades after the time of its setting.
