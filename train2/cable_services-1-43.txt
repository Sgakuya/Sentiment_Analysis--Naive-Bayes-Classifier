The installer did not show after I sat and waited for 3 hours. When I called customer service they assured me that he did and I somehow missed him. ?!? Here is my favorite part, "Because you missed your appointment we will need to re-schedule." So...um...I'm going to miss another day of work for this. The biggest problem - I don't really have a choice.
