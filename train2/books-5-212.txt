I have read this book many times and it is excellent in showing us the many sides to this wonderful lady who left us so suddenly. Many people only list negative things about her, but she also had positives. She was a great actress, and she loved her children. She couldn't help the problems she had, she was influenced and almost forced into these problems. This book was a very good read.
