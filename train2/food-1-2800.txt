Something about these candy bars seems incredibly cheaply made (and not just because it's forever associated with those bumbling contestants on The Apprentice). It sounds like it should be good, but it's just flavorless and gross. Really looks like the Mars co., like many other packaged-food manufacturers, is cutting some corners.
