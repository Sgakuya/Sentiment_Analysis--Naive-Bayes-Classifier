Kevin Spacey has thrilled us all from day one with his versatility. But his most impressive talent is his ability to remove himself from himself and convince us that he's *not* Kevin Spacey, that there *is* no Kevin Spacey. He chooses characters into which he fits like a hand in a glove (oh, I just set myself up for an O.J. joke, there, didn't I?), and he not only *plays* that character, he *becomes* that character, doing whatever it takes (a dorky haircut, intense physical training) to keep us from thinking of him as Kevin Spacey, and force us to believe that he is whoever he is.
