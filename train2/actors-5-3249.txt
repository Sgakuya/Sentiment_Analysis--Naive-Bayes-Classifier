As someone said previously Willem Dafoe is underated and often overlooked. He is one of Hollywoods finest actors.I have seen him in so many films and he is always on the money . He really makes you empathize with his character and he delivers. He's been in so many great movies and in so many great roles. From Virgil Cole in Flight of the Intruder to Bob Crane's associate, John Carpenter, in Auto Focus and everything else. Willem Dafoe makes any film more interesting. He was also great in a futuristic techno movie little masterpiece called The New Rose Hotel.
