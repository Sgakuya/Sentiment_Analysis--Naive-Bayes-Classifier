I thought this book was really over rated. I live in buddhist/hindu country and mr. hesse really did not get the idea at all. The writing is simple and yet it feels like Herman is trying to hard, which really defeats the moral of the novel. This book was only popular with hippies in the 70's, and i have no idea why any one would read it today. no... i take that back. read i, and find out for yourself exactly how boring and prosiac this book really is.
