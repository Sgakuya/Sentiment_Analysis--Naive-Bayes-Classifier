Well that AFI award that Tom Hanks is getting i think that Robin Williams should be getting it not that Tom isnt a good actor but Robin is awesome ! kinda gave everyone a shock in Insomnia. No one is use to you playing a role of a killer and it was awesome to say the least! hes an awesome actor and i love everyone of his movies! AWESOME ..... Amy !
