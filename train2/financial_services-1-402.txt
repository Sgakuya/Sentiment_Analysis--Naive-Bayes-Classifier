 Effective 12-31-2002, Clients...who maintain a balance of less than 25,000 will be charged a $25 per quarter fee. After 15 years, loyal customer through bust and boom, and several dollars short of 25k, I'm being charged a penalty! YOU SUCK, Mr. Reilly. Quick as I can, I'm fleeing with my Transfer Form and quickly depositing to a less, money-sucking broker.
