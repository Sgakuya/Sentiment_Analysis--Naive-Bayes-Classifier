Susan Flannery is one of the greatest actresses ever! Watched her in the film Towering Inferno for which she won the Golden Globe. She was gorgeous on her appearances in Dallas. Saw her on occasion in Days of Our Lives and now as Stephanie on B B. She is a strong, beautiful lady who can play any role to perfection. B B is fortunate to have her. Hope she gets another Emmy this year.
