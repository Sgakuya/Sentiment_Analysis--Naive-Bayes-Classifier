2000 elantra gls not impressed the brakes needed resurfacing at 6000 miles it shifted in a strange and slightly unpredictable maner. The seats on longer drives and especialy the front passenger's seat were uncomfortable compaired to my '01 toyota corolla. then on 9/9/02 I came out in the am to the CFD extinguishing an interior electrical fire. The center colum, steering wheel. dash board, shifter leaver, hvac and radio were all melted. The dealership had replaced the radio in Jan and is refusing my warranty claim now. Greatest warranty Ha!
