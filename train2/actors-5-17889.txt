I love Kathy, she's so cute! She is certainly the most talented of all the younger performers on OLTL. I wish she would give Michael a chance, though...if not, there's always me!--but I digress. Hopefully we'll see bigger and better things from this girl in the future. I wish her all the luck in the world!
