Puerto Vallarta Getaway Club Resort: I would never return to this hell hole. This place was a huge disappointment. To say that it was not what I expected would be a huge understatement. It was worse than I could ever imagine. It’s a one star hotel that somehow mysteriously got a 4 star rating. Everything about this place was horrible. The rooms were disgustingly dirty and we were forced to move four times. The beach was filthy and rocky. The food wasn’t exactly delicious either. We were bored to death at this resort, since they didn’t bother with entertainment. My vacation was ruined and I would never return to this resort even if they paid me.
