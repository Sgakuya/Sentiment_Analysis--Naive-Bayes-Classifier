Kathleen Turner is a wonderful actress who is maturing with grace. She has not been given the proper respect that her colleagues receive and Hollywood has not been kind to her. But she continues to shine in the better movies she has acted in and hopefully one day, she will get her name on the walk of fame and an Oscar. Turner is a standout in Romancing the Stone, War of the Roses, and Virgin Suicides.
