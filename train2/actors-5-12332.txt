Halle Berry is a great actress and she is beautiful as well. Just like what another rateitall member Music4Life said, when you have so much going for you people will try to judge .What woman wouldn't want to be Mrs. Berry? Beautiful with tons of money and not to mention men literally throwing themselves at you. She may have done roles that aren't completely upstanding. Unless you're an actor/actress you may not know that sometimes you have to take roles just for a little exposure to boost your career. Of course within good reason though. The most beautiful women get so much critism! Halle is the bomb!
