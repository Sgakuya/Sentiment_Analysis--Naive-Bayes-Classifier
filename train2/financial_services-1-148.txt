Anywhere else BUT citibank. They locked my SAVINGS accounts due to inactivity, and now that I need to make an urgent payment while travelling abroad, its been three days already and they still can't figure out why my savings account is locked...the supervisor even told me that it should take anywhere between 3-5 days!!!!!!
