When you come to St Louis... come with low expectations. Then you won't be so dissappointed, like I was. The good thing about STL is that it is cheap to live here - but there's a reason for that. The place is boring, after you have gone to the park, zoo, city museum, botanical garden, and science center, there is nothing left to do... you basically have finished STL. The locals aren't too bad.. although, I wish they were a little less brain dead. The driving is appalling.. for a people who have no where near the traffic of a real city. Watch out for the lack of turn signals and the notorious left turns people take at 4-way red-light intersections.. Culture? ha.. well, other than 1904 World's Fair, which they will mention again and again and again until your ears bleed, there's not much culture here. I was really dissappointed in the midwest becuase of STL, but luckily, Chicago (5 hours drive away) is a good escape and has redeemed the midwest in my opinion. Can't wait to finish my degree and get out of here.. STL is OK for about 2 years.. beyond that, you really just are desperate to leave.
