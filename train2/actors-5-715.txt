I will admit that my knowledge of Anthony Perkins is solely from his role in Psycho, and normally I wouldn't comment on an actor whose work I have such a limited knowledge of. But he so impressed me in Psycho! His smile at the end of the film haunted my dreams for years, and still chills me whenever I see it!
