I echo the comments of Eraser1997. When MCI restructured their rate plans, they automatically assigned me to the highest cost plan which had me paying $0.25/min for all of my calls. More recently I found a $25 phone call to a cell number that I don't know to an area where I don't know anyone. The rep I talked to called the number and said that the voice mail box did not identify the holder of the number. Which was a lie. The phone no. was no longer in service, which she conveniently neglected to tell me. Bottomline, they refuse to reimburse me for the call. I plan to change long distance providers.
