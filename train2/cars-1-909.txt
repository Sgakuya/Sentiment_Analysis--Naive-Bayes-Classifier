My 2000 Kawasaki 1100 has had nothing but problems since the first month I put the unit in the water. I might first mention that I am 67 years old, do not race and have been boating for 25 years. The first year we operated the ski for about 25 hours due to the fact that it had a series of overheating problems and 2 factory recalls. I might mention that I bought the ski in the spring of 91 as a leftover. The second year, after a total of 4 months and 50 hours of operation the engine came unglued. This is a total time on the ski of 50 hours. Since it was out of warranty KW said they would not pay for the repair, but would pay for parts. This cost me $860 for labor and the rest of the boating season. For some reason the #1 cylinder went to full lean and caused the engine to detonate. At no time was there any indication of a problem on the engine monitoring system. Since KW would not reveal to me or the mechanic what caused the problem, I now have a ski that I would hesitate to take out on any open water. The dealer was supportive, but because of this problem and two other blown 1100 engines in his shop, he will no longer sell or service this ski. DO NOT BUY THIS JET SKI!
