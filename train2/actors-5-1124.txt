I say Tom Hanks is truly one of the greatest. To get a glimpse of his amazing talent, I recommend Forrest Gump (1994 release, best picture, best actor), Big (1988, nominated best actor), Saving Private Ryan (1998, best picture, nominated best actor), Philadelphia (1993, not my favorite, but nevertheless, best actor), Sleepless in Seattle (1992, sweet romantic comedy), Apollo 13 (1993, I cry every time :P ), Cast Away (2000, nominated best actor)... and lots and lots to come.
