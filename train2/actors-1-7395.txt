In every movie, this man plays himself i.e. Unredeemable Wimp. Anyone who think that his protrayal of a special ops soldier in the Apocalypse Now was true to life was smoking the same weed that this spindly little girly boy was during the shooting of this movie. He's a junky and a dimwitted sanctimonious reformed drunk. p.s. I don't care what his politics are. He is a dope and he has just as much right as any other dope has to have his voice heard.
