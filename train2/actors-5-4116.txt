I think I like his smile the most. It's evil, boyish, charming and sweetly sincere all at once. I just like the talent that seems to casually come out with an easy air of confidence and shyness. But mostly he's just a very well rounded actor that makes me believe I'm where he is, seeing and hearing everything around him. That's talent! Also he's tall, Ilike them tall.
