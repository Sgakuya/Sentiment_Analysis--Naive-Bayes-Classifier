If you can endure the sensation of chewing on pine needles, then this cereal might work for you. However, you should be warned about the flavor. In my opinion, it tastes like a combination of cardboard and sawdust. The only thing going for Nabisco's Shredded Wheat is the way you get to crush it into small pieces before eating it- something I'm much more in the mood to do after I've finished it!
