I don't know if there is a person on this earth who is more informed about the Battle of Stalingrad. I really enjoyed two of Beevor's books, The Fall of Berlin and Stalingrad. I think that a few books should be added to this list, The Guns of August by Barbara Tuchman, maybe The Art of War by Sun Tzu. My opinion is that this list is littered with Ambrose, far too many Amborse books on here.
