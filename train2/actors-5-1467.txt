Jack is one of my most favorite actors of all time! The Shining is one of my favorite movies as well. I love his expressions! He makes me laugh out loud every time he smirks or goes ballisitic on someone. He is an overall excellent actor, and you can tell by his long line of extensive accomplishements he is as well.
