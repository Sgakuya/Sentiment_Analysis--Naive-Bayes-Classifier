I'm in the middle of a Harrison Ford film fest, and wonder if anyone knows of a major video rental chain that carries any or all of his earlier stuff? I'm particularly obsessed with finding what I believe is his debut film, Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round, as the title is intruiging, regardless of who's in the movie! Is that the film in which HF plays a bellboy at a hotel and is only on screen for something like 40 seconds - just long enough to tell Mr. Somebody or Other that he has a telegram at the desk? If anybody has any answers or ideas to share, could you please e-mail me at t.tasso@juno.com? Thanks! PS - I LIKE Regarding Henry - I think it's kind of a sweet movie.
