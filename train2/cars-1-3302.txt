I purchased my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo brand new about 4 months ago. I have had more problems out it than any other car before. 1st it was an improperly installed tie-rod end bushing. Then a defective shim kit. My suv is at the dealership now for the same reason it was last week as well. The passenger side speakers quit working and there is a rubbing noise coming from the steering wheel when I turn. The service in the Memphis Tennessee area is terrible. I dont not recommend anyone to ever buy a Jeep vehicle. I know I wont ever do it again. I am now in the process of trying to get rid of it so I can purchase a Toyota 4Runner.
