Reese is definitely the best actress right now. Whether you like her or not she's a proven A-List Actress. This decade she has almost single-handedly saved and carried films that were sure to be flops ( The Legally Blonde films, Sweet Home Alabama). She's paid her dues and her credibility has been good even before the surprise 2001 hit Legally Blonde (which she was nominated her 2nd Golden Globe). Her past films haven't been box-office draws, but have had great performances, 1999's Golden globe winning performance Election, the broken lover in the soapy Cruel Intentions, the materilistic slutty girl in Pleasentville, the vulnerable girlfriend in Fear, and one of my favorites the misunderstood juvenile delinquent in the independent film Freeway, also has notable roles in Man in the Moon, and Disney's A far off place which is her first film she carried at 15. She's only 27 and none of her peers or older actresses can seem to carry a descent performance whether in good or bad films on a consistent basis and some of these actresses haven't lived up to their big paychecks. Reese is no doubt in my mind the best in the business and she seems to only get better.
