She's out there and in your face. She's not afraid to do anything. She's true to herself. I think she's great. I really respect her. Her acting is excellant as she add's flare to all her roles. Girl, Interrupted was amazing! It's no wonder she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Keep it up Angelina, you go girl!
