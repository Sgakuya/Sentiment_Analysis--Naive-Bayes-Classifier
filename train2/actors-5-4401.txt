Mr. Isaacs is a very talented actor, as most British actors are IMHO. ;D The majority, if not all, of his movies, show he has a tight grasp on the craft (of acting), much unlike most of the 'hotties' that are being spawned today w/no true acting talent. The Patriot should have been a 'launchpad' for his career, as far as in America. Can't wait for future projects...well deserving of a 5!
