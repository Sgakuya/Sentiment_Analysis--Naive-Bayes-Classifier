I absolutely adore Matthew Perry. He is one of the most talented and gorgeous actors ever. I would love to meet him someday and tell him all of this. They couldn't have found anyone who could take his place as Chandler, it must have been written with him in mind. He's so hilarious. I love him. He seems like he would have the greatest personality if you met him. Even after the troubles he's gone through, he still knows how to make us laugh. To add, He's never looked better. If he ever reads this I hope he knows that all his fans are behind him 100% and we are proud of all that he has accomplished. He is the greatest inspiration to me. I hope on day to become an actress as well. '@' Sheila
