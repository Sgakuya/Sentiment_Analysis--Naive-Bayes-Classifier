i just don't find it funny... you can identify with the charachters and everything but it's just cute and not funny. also, people only like it because it lasted fifty years, it's like garfield... people like it because it's cute but not a good comic strip. it dosn't deserve to be above foxtrot. i suppose it was funny for it's time. definitely it is a classic, but not a good one.
