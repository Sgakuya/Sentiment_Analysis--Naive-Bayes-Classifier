As a student of clemson I cant say enough bad things about it. It is full of 5th generation rednecks that forget they lost the civil war. It alsmost seems as though everyone that is a local is brainwashed, i feel sorry that everyone is so narrow minded. Dont get me started on boat shoes, camo and the North Face. Im considering dropping out and creating a store on campus that specializes in those three items. If this school ever wants to be a nationally recognized school it needs to start accepting more out of state students to raise test scores and lower ignorance.
