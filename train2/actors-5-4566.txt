Jim is my all time favourite comedian/actor. Not y favourite actor in general, but comedy wise,he's got the title. I just saw A Series of Unfortunate Events, and while it wasn't his best performance, it was still hilarious. Probaly my favourite movie of his would be The Grinch, and I know it's corny, but I still laugh every time!
