Visiting family in Louisiana, my family and I always had to drive through this really underwhelming state. What I saw were 50's-era highways beaten to hell and accompanying trash everywhere. Although the state helped give rise to some meteoric figures, I'm not so forgiving about Jimmy Buffett. Oxford seems like an alright town, but I wouldn't know as I haven't visited, but the pervading atmosphere is one of the Deep South, which isn't my favorite region. Facts and figures speak for themselves, and Mississippi is a big embarrassment though they're making some strides.
