As a fellow Aussie, all I can say is Hugh is a great upcoming Australian actor. He's 100 times better an actor than that pain in the butt, Russell Crowe, and at least 3000 times better looking. I predict Hugh's gonna go far. Though I wish he could lose the Yank accent in the movies he's made - your Aussie accent is a breath of fresh air!
