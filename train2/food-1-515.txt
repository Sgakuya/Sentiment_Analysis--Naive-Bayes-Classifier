The worst of the marshmallow cereals. At least with count Chocula they coughed up a few cents to add some cocoa. Not this crap, just flavorless puffs of some mystery ceral grain and those hard, chalky boulders that once may have been marshmallow. Alos, not that I really care but how do you think people would react if it was an embarrassing Hispanic or Jewish stereotype selling this cereal. There'd be bloodshed, that's what. Guess it's okay if it's an Irish stereotype, they don't matter....
