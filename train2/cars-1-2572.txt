Its too expensive, its ugly, and chances are, with its compression ratio, it wont last more than 50,000 miles without needing a new engine, or transmission....those would only cost...oh, $100,000 USD...and its top speed is 233, for the person who said its well over 250. just like lambroghini and ferarri, if McLAren knew that you were going to drive an F1 more than 50 miles a year...they wouldnt sell you one. whats the point of owning a million dollar machine if you can't drive it?
