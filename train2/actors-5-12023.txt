I have never seen Winona Ryder do a terrible job at acting. I have always thought she was very talented. I would say my favorite movie of hers was HEATHERS co-starring Christian Slater in the 80's. Really good cult hit. The only movie I can think of right now that I could not stand that she starred in was REALITY BITES. I hated the movie, but I tolerated it only because of her. I honestly don't think the movie would have made it to theatres without her.(and of course the great Janeane Garefalo She can definately make a dull movie into something more fun.)
