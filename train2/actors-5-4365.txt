Really shouldn't give him 5 stars, cause his roles are basically the same: a rich city guy involved in some sort of corruption or sleaze, but he does it so well, and his movies are so entertaining that I must give him the highest rating. My favorite movie of all time is Wall St, due in no small part to his award winning performance.
