When I lived in Chi I had the misfortune of being forced to drive through this state on my way to and from VA. I had uniformly bad experiences but one sticks out. I stop at a truckstop hours from Kentucky. They've rack after rack of rebel flag decals; now whatever that flag might mean down south it only means one thing two hours from the Mason-Dixon line. (Also, the clan took over the state government in the 30's and currently has it's headquarters in Terra Haute). Then the woman at the counter was rude as heck to me. Everyone in this state is rude as far as I can tell, the landscape is boring, and the food stinks. On top of the casual bigotry there's Indianans pretty unwholesome obsession with college sports to the exception of everything else; need I mention the University of Indiana and Bobby Knight? Win or not they wouldn't tolerate him for ten seconds down at Chapel Hill. It's like someone magnified everything I don't like about the South and took away everything I love about the place. Not the armpit of the midwest, no Indiana is the armpit of the nation.
