Vonnegut's view of WWII captures the little ironies and odd situations of war perfectly. His tone is free from nationalism or patriotics, and instead tells the stories of individual people in truly bizarre situations. His characters have very little power over their lives, and thus are mostly wide-eyed observers and passive participants in the war.
