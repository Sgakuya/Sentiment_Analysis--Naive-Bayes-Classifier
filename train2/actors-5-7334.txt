I have watched all of Vin's movies and I think he has the talent to go very far in films. It's had to soar like an eagle when you are surrounded by turkeys. In other words, it's the script that makes or breaks an actor. Of course, I should qualify this by saying that I love sci-fi. He's not a cutesy guy like Affleck or Pitt, but I still think he's too cool!!!! He stays out of the limelight, unlike so many actors. It's hard for us fans to find new info on him. You're still COOL Vin.
