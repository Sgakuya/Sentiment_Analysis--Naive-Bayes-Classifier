Jim Carrey is a master of comedy. I have to admit he has had afew bad apples, but he has had a range of original characters. How the Grinch Stole Christmas should be really good, as I also love Dr. Suess, and with Jim Carrey it should be a hit! Carrey is capable with making us cry not from laughing but of being serious, but I think he should stick to being funny, because that's where people really want to see in movies. We want to laugh, so go, Jimmy, go!
