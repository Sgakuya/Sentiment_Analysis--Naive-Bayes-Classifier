Is this site for Cuervo employees or people born without tastebuds? Cuervo alone is responsible for tequila's bad reputation for giving people horrible hangovers and making people sick. It is THE WORST possible tequila you can drink! I drink the cheapest rail tequila before I will put that crap in my body. Real gold tequila is aged in oak barrels for years, and white tequila (my favorite) is aged in stainless steel tanks but Cuervo doesn't even bother to age the stuff...they just add caramel coloring and ship it to the stores. If everyone's first experience with tequila had been with Patron instead of Cuervo, tequila would be more popular than beer today! Go to a good tequila bar and sample the good stuff people and use the Cuervo for what it's meant for...to unclog your toilet!
