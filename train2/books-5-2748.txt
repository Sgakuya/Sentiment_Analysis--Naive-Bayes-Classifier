To date, this book is the most comprehensive reading material on soul. Some of the ideas are beyond what I am conscious of at present, but allow for comtemplation and meditation about the new ideas. I recommend this as a cover-to-cover read and not a skip around . It's best to allow this author to develop ideas and build on them. I will read everything Zukav has written.
