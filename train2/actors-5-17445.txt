I've been watching DOOL since I was like two and from the very beginning Marlena was my favorite. I thought she was gorgeous and I loved her and JOhn together. 16 years later I still feel the same way. She is my fav on DOOL and the only reason I watch. She brings so much to the show and her character. She is def one of the best on daytime, along with Robin Christopher!
