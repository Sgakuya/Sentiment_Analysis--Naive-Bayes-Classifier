Ah Christina...Great as Charlize's whiney lesbian girlfriend in Monster, she is a talented actress that inhabits the roles she plays, and I'm sure there is much more to come. Always remember her as Wynona's cute little sister in Mermaids, running around with the pumpkin on her head. Needs to forget about Hollywoods image obsession and just let her lovely self shine.
