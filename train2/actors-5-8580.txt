Natalie Wood is one of my favorite actresses next to Debbie Reynolds, Vivien Leigh and June Allyson. I remember when she died Thanksgiving weekend of 1981. So very sad and tragic. She was so beautiful and talented. I really love Splendor in the Grass, West Side Story, Gypsy and Rebel Without a Cause.
