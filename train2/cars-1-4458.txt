My 95 Windstar has 83,000 miles on it. The head gasket, timing chain cover gasket and radiator have gone bad. In addition my oil pan rusted through. This vehicle has been fully maintained. The worst part is that I can't sell it because all dealers avoid the Ford 4.3 engine and I'm just not the type of guy who would unload this van to an innocent person. I finally realized that this engine is going to die no matter what I do and am driving it until it goes. In the mean time I have to save up for another engine. I trust JASPER engines to build my next one right.
