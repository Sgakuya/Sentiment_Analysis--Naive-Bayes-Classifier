Natalia Livingston is an awesome Emily. She is the only Emily for me. She exudes class and maturity and I love watching her on my screen. I hope she stays around for a long time, because General Hospital wouldn't be the same without her. Also, her and Tyler Christopher are just amazing together. Gooo Natty!!
