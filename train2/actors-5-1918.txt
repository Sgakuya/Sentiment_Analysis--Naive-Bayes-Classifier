I loved him ever since I saw him in 21 Jump Street on the FOX network years and years ago. He is a great actor that knows how to bring such great emotion in every character he plays. The fact that he actually made EDWARD SCISSORHANDS into a good movie speaks for itself. No one else could have made that movie worth watching. Of course he had the help of Winona Ryder, another great performer. I think Johnny Depp is a living legend already. I can't wait for his next movie.
