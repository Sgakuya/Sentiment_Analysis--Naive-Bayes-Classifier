very, very underated actor due to the fact he has played in alot of david lynch movies (some good some bad) one of them being the very underated dune(awsome movie) however for me he will always be agent dale cooper from twin peaks.(great show) the movie the hidden was also a good preformance. also check out his guest host preformance on saturday night live the sprockets skit and send up version of twin peaks are very funny. great actor.
