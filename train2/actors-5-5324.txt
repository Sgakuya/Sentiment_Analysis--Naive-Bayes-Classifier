RDJ is an amazingly talented actor, musician and artist. Anything that happens in his personal life has no bearing on his professional talents. We are lucky to have been able to enjoy his performances thus far and I personally cannot wait to see more of him in the future. My thought and prayers are with him for a successful recovery!
