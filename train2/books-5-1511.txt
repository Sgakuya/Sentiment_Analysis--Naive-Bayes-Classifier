The all-time classic. Peanuts characters are so familiar they've been burned into our collective unconscious. Snoopy is clearly the best comic dog ever created. He bosses Charlie Brown around, plays baseball, writes novels, flies WWI fighter planes, hangs out with a gay bird, plays hockey, steals Linus' blanket, and sneaks smooches from Peppermint Patty. Not bad for a beagle.
