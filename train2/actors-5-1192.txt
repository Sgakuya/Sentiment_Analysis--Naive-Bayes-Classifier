A singular and standout talent! There are only two movies that my father and I managed to see together...Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan. I can only say that in all my life I have never seen my father become so moved by the acting talents of any one person. As an actor and father himself, Tom Hanks is simply outstanding!
