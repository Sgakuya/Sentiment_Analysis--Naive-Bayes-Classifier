Gweneth's movie Duets has confirmed what I've know all along-that she can't act. Her past films all had heavy marketing behind them and Harvey Wienstein, and she hid behind a british accent. But she can only act in privilaged roles that resmble her upbringing. She made a fool of herself in her daddy's movie by stereotyping and condescending the role of a lower class woman, and not only is she a terrible actress but she should be ashamed of herself for perpetuating the stereotype that a woman without money and social standing is a cheesy, pathetic slut.
