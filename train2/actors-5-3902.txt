I must say I am madly in love with Matt Damon. He is a great actor, and writer and he is very creative. One of my favorite things about Matt Damon is that he is SMART! He went to Harvard and was a few credits (two i think) from getting his degree when he dropped out to be an actor. He is a great actor, and he does not play the same people in each movie! Unless you think he plays a crazy poor little boy who takes over someone elses life (Talented Mr. Ripley) in every movie!
