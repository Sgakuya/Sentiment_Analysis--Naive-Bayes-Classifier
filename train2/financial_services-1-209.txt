I too have experienced the joy of BOA sitting on a lower amount checks to then pay the higher amount. Then trampeling you with $31 NSF. When dealing with their customer service department I have even less luck. Recently I had a larger check clear two days after two previous transactions had already posted, they then back charged me for these two transaction and the current. $99 fee. I've tried e-mail and the 800 # with no luck, although they we're polite enough to tell me about other services they offer. I don't like the one I have, why would I want another one. Sad, as I had BOA many years ago in AZ and never had problems. Now in Chicago they have gone sour.
