I'll spare you all from my usual rhapsodic waxing...but I'd give him a six and a half if I could. He is the greatest actor of the twentieth century in my opinion. If more people had seen a wider scope of his work instead of the usual ones (Casablanca, Arsenic & Old Lace, The Maltese Falcon, and a handful of blah ones from later in his career) he would receive the respect he deserves. I only wish his more obscure films were available for everyone to see. Also, may I add that I agree with Jezebel_Haddo that Peter Lorre is, indeed, one of the sexiest men who ever walked the earth! Mmm-hmm, you heard me.
