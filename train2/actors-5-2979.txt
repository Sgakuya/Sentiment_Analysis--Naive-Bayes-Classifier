Sean Connery is by far one of my favorite actors. He has grown even hotter with age, not that he wasn't gorgeous in the Bond films... and for a few of you that say he has no acting talent, I reccomend you to see First Knight and Finding Forrester, both of which are great. The fact that my favorite accent in the world is Scottish, he is even more attractive to me. But he is almost 73, you say... so he is, and damn sexy at that.
