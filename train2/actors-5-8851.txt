Sandra Bullock is one actress that it doesn't seem as if she's acting. She does many of her roles in her movies like its natural. I really enjoyed While you were sleeping and Miss Congeniality. In 2001, American Comedy Award awarded her as the funniest lead actress in a motion picture. She is a very entertaining actress.
