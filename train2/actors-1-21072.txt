A sad, sad story. An ordinary, very pretty small-town girl from Canada heads to the States to make it big. Unfortunately, her lack of character and talent make her victim of unscrupulous producers and he own lack of self-respect. As a result, this pretty girl transforms herself (through the wonders of surgery) into a freakish silocone and saline based manniquin that quickly becomes the punchline for every two-bit stand up comic. Her stunning lack of talent means her only recourse is to depend solely on her noteriety and penchant for attracting sleazy rock stars. A tragic joke and a coutionary tale for all those young girls with aspirations for stardom.
