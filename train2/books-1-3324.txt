This story is either a great success, or a great failure, depending on your perspective. From the perspective of the quality of story, it's a major success. I thoroughly enjoyed the character development and the story telling, all the way up until he quit writing it. However, from the business perspective, it was a dismal failure. Stephen King assured us (his loyal readers) that as long as we kept paying for the story, he would keep writing it, and he did not keep that promise. For no reason that he's seen fit to print, or commit to his web-site, he quit writing the plant, and he's never really said why. If the numbers of paying customers to non-paying customers fell below his established ratio, he's forgiven, and I understand. However, he's never SAID that, and so we are left to suppose that he A) ran out of story idea, which I find hard to imagine or b) got bored with the story and decided to give it up. Either way, his biggest error was not telling us. An explanation! The story was great! The character development, and the plot development left nothing to be desired. However, it is unfinished, and we do not know why. I would NOT recommend reading this story until it's been finished.
