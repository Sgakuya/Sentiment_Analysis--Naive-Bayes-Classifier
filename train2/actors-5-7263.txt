Billy Crudup is the Al Pacino of our time. You can compare the eccentric oddness of FH in Jesus' son to that of Pacino's performance as the aimless junkie Sonny in The Panic in Neddle Park. In Waking the Dead Crudup's final breakdown rant reminds me of the intensity Pacino displays in Dog Day Afternoon. Both of these actors inhabit there charcters so fully they themselves become unrecognizable. Crudups performances are a constant reminder of the art that is film, he takes chances, rejects vanity and convention all to service the need of the characters and the films they inhabit.
