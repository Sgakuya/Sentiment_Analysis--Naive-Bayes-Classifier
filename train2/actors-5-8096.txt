Even though Bette excelled at playing bitches, she was also quite good at playing more sympathetic characters in movies like Marked Woman, Now, Voyager, and The Great Lie. She had such intensity and had more range than most actresses of her time. Definitely the best dramatic and entertaining actress of her time. Who can forget Margo Channing in All About Eve? Fasten your seatbelts, it's gonna be a bumpy night!
