This book works on so many levels. Not only does it explore the complex relationships that form with romance, it examines Franz' struggle with his own identity in context with society. Kundera writes so well about identies and how people form their own. It is facsinating to see Tomas and Tereza form their own identities in light of their relationship and how Sabina influences it. Being an avid fan of Tolstoy, I also love the irony of the dog's name, Karenin.
