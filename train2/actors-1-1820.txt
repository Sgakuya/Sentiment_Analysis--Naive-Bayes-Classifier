Ok actor, but his off-camera schtick turns me off. He is another weirdo, anti-American idiot that probably has no good reason for his beliefs. He strikes me as the weird, gothy type of kid that tried to make people hate him in high school. He is kind of arrogant in a way, and he conveys this in his movies. He takes roles to stroke his massive ego, not to act. I'm not a big fan, watch for this guy to evaporate pretty soon in Hollywood, I doubt his act will last for long.
