Thank goodness we had actresses like Katherine Hepburn who used their own integrity. In her time women had to wear skirts and dresses, instead when bullied by studio bosses she opted for her own choice of clothing such as trousers(pants). Such demonstrations of insistance showed her independence and that women should and would be respected on and off screen and not just treated as sexual objects. She's one of the most respected actresses to date and oozed everything of a true screen icon.
