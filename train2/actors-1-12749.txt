i really don t like her!! and its probably because of the movies she plays - she doesn t seem to be able to choose a decent one! the only one i really liked until now was EMMA, in this one i think she did a good job. As for the others, god! she needs some advice on how to choose a good character and get rid of those stupid poor me roles that she s been doing so far.
