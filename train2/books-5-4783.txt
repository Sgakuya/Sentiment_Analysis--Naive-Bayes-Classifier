A great book. How I love Hemingway, let me count the ways... this is a book about war, and the relationships between people who are caught up in events which is so much bigger than they are. Hemingway can say so much, and imply so much, with so few words, and he is at his best in this heartbreaking book. I think the vivid scene of the retreat from Caporetto is the highlight.
