 I got sprint 6 months ago I signed up for 2000 Min plan $149 after 4 months of BAD service. The phone won't work from my house in a metropolitain city I was told they don't say the phones will work INSIDE. The most of my minutes I used was about 500 in one month. I switched back to AT T (great customer service). When I called to cancel my service I was told there was a $150 cancelation fee which I knew about but they say the don't prorate so for the 20 minutes I used the phone this month it will be $149 for a total of $299 to cancel my service with them. There customer service people are rude and don't care what is the right thing to do!
