I can't even believe that they still make this garbage. Not only is the taste and texture disgusting..the whole color scheme is harsh and unappealing. The pink, white and black pellets of too sweet candy shell covering the nasty black licorice flavor are the worst invention EVER. The gaudy purple box doesn't do anything for me either. All in all this is the worst candy ever made.
