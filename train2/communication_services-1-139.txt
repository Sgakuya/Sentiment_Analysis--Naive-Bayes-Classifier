"We're not hanging up on you, sir, our phoens are just dropping some of our calls." - Vonage 2 weeks, no device, no update about why I haven't received my advice. 6 calls later, I discovered they placed my order incorrectly (I ordered over the phone), and that they need me to cancel my order and try again. OH WAIT! No, they can send me what I asked for! Hours waiting on the phone, being hung up on, and all the agitation and frustration and they will grant me the ability to get what I had initially asked for! GREAT! See this review on every site I can place it. Vonage is bad rubbish, may it live short and crumble.
