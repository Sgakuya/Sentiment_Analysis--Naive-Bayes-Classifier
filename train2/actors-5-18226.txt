Natalia Livingston has brought such beauty, grace and emotion to the character of Emily on General Hospital. It is hard to believe this role is her first acting job! I can't imagine anyone else in the role! She has proven over and over that she can handle any emotional scene. She has truly made Emily her own. I think she is one of the best recasts GH has ever had!
