Breezed by Lucy & Desi/Before The Laughter yesterday.The laughter was at that talking baboon Benard's acting.It is no surprise that he landed back on soaps after doing such a joke of a part like that.I was a great fan of Desi Arnaz and I find it truly sad that they chose such an untalented clown like Benard to portray him.
