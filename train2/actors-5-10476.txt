While Ms Portman is undeniably pretty, that is not the reason that I admire her. It is refreshing to see a young actress who is more concerned with education than acting, and who won't pose naked in degrading pictures, which is accepted as the norm. She is an excellent actress, and outshone by miles her co-star Hayden Christensen in episode 2. While I am a fan of all her films, my favourite must be Leon, it was exceptional.Good luck to her.
