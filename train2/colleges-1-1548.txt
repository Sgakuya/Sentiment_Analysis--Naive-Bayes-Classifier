It seems odd to even place an institution of higher learning in West Virginia - the state that leads the Nation in fewest teeth per capita (an actual fact, check it out). Seriously though, this school is below average at best academically, Morgantown is a sorry excuse for a college town, and the only thing students pride themselves on is getting wasted. A truly lame school.
