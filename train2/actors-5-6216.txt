If you looked at his career outside of The Green Mile, you could say his acting ability wasn't all that special. He seemed to play the same character each time. However, his performance in The Green Mile was truly incredible. He showed such emotion and was the best part of the movie. It's amazing that he was able to go back to work each day as his role must have been mentally exhausting. I have also seen him interviewed and he is truly excited by his success and thankful to those who have helped him get to where he is. After his performance in The Green Mile, I expect big things from him.
