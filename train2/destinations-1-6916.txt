Bordering on third world- somewhat primitive- a state held captive by the past and its continued bigotry of anyone not white, straight and christian. A poor educational attainment of its populace (along with a lowly educational system) are responsible for this states low standing- along with resistance to change and progressive ideas. A good place to live? NOPE- also not a place I would go with a license plate from a state in New England- need I say more?
