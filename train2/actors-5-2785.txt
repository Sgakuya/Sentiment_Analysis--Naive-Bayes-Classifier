Kevin Spacey-- An actor of tremendous charm and range. His comedic timing is impeccable, but he is just as capable of portraying serious (and creepy) roles with incredible depth. His talent can actually carry a mediocre movie along with it, and not many actors can claim that. He is also an excellent singer. Oh my, I could say so many things about the effect Mr. Spacey has on me, but how helpful would that be? It's probably best for me to stick to his phenomenal acting ability and not get going on his eyes, his dimples, his smile, his body, his-- Oh gee, here I go again!
