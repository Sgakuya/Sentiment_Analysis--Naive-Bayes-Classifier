Cher's comments about the possible election of George W Bush are ludicrous. She wants everyone to remember the regan/bush years when everyone had no jobs or money? I would bet a whole year's salary that SHE did not suffer with a lack of job or money. How dare she speak for the regular joe? All these celebrities are concerned with one thing, and one thing only: that the election of a republican, or the possibility of a war will deter our attention from them and their shows, music, concerts or movies. They are concerned about their pocket books, and that's it. They have no real opinions or views.
