I LOVE Janeane. I'll watch any movie if it has her in it (provided she's not in it for only two seconds!) I actually don't own any of her movies, considering that I'm broke as a dropped egg, but I've seen several on cable TV, including TTACAD, Minus Man, The Matchmaker, Romy and Michele's H.S. Reunion (Heather Mooney epitomizes all that I endeavor to be), Steal This Movie, Kiki's Delivery Service, Titan A.E. and Dogma.
