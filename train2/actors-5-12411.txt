One of the most under-rated Black-Actresses of our time. A woman whose talent is not respected or recognised enough. She was seriously robbed of an Oscar in 1994 for her role in Tina What's Love Got to do With It . Her concentration on screen is amazing as she gives her all and it shows through her performance. Every single spoken word or even un-spoken word is delivered in such a sincere manner with the utmost honesty. Every single role shes ever played whether supporting or leading has been fulfilled with this womans gracious presence and never failing to deliver and give her character not only a voice, but true realism and life.
