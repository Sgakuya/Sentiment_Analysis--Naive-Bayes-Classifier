An absolute hack. He has about three good performances, I assume by accident, but most of the time this scenary chewing Welshman is unbelievably bad. Watch Exorcist II or the Assassination of Trotsky or Cleopatra or just about anything else, and then come back here and make a case that he could act. Should be one thousandth on this list, if he's lucky.
