By far the worst banking experience i have ever had. As others have said they will hit you with $1 or $2 charges that just so happen to not show up until they say you have overdrawn and rape you with a 5 dollar a day overdraft charge. I have used a lot of banks and have never had a per day charge. Basiclly they are in the business of robbery disquised as a bank. I am in the process of trying to cancel my account after they decided to rape me like this for the 4th month in a row. if you have other banks in your town GO THERE!!! And as far as Mr. high and mighty trying to defend the bank he probally works for learn to spell and use punucation before trying to blast people that have been robbed by these crooks.
