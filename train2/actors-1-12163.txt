One of the worst actors in the world! Sure, most people probably think she's good looking and think that adds to her acting and her roles, but her role playing of characters are exactly the same. Even in Go , Disturbing Behaviour she's trying to play a weird, different character to her Dawson's Creek-Joey but her character of Joey always shines through. She cannot portray any other character successfully without resorting to Joey Potter coming through. Very bad characterisation and ability to take on different roles. Also, to add to the replies written. Everyone is praising her for her beauty. That doesn't make you a good actor necessarily.
