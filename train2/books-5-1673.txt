Hilarious. Dilbert absolutely nails the absurdity of corporate life. It's almost depressing to know that the experiences and situations Scott Adams writes about are so universal that a majority of people who work in the business world can relate to them. I mean, should Catbert, the Evil HR Director be such a familiar figure that we recognize him immediately? If we're going to have business archetypes, shouldn't they be things like Wise Old Man and The Hero instead of Pointy-Haired Boss and Wally ?
