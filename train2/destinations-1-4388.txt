This place is hell on earth and I want to get out!! Been living here for 4 year and can pretty much say its an ok place to visit put don't even think about staying. From the exnewyorkers (I'am one so I can judge) who are 100 times more hospitable back home to the native rednecks on down to the cubans,haitians s.america latino pop. everybody hates everybody. Lets not even talk about the weather.Chasing Palmetto bugs the size of your fist while they are flying overhead should qualify as an olympic sport down here.This place is the pits they should cut it off from the mainland and let it float off into oblivion.
