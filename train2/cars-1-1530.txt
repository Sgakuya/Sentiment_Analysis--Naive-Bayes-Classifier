I can't believe this car. Driving one reminds me of 15 year old Escorts. I give the Saturn Dealers a 5 Star rating for being able to sell such a feeble car. Atta Boy Saturn Dealers! I think Saturn dealers could sell Yugo's (a step below a Saturn SL at zero stars). GM should sell Saturn to Ford or Chrysler who with their Engineering and Styling capabilities could take this franchise to the top.
