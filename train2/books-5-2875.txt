Read the book five years ago. Thought it was excellent and would make a great movie. Saw the movie, thought it was in my top 5 of all time. Bought the movie on cd. And read the book again earlier this year just to see how close the movie and book stories matched. I would recommend both to anyone who likes a riveting gut-wrenching war story.
