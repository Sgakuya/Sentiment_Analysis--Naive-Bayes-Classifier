First glance it's alomost like you're in an American city... gleaming skyscrapers, ritzy shopping malls, traffic, white suburbs, black ghettos, and lots of guns. There are no attractions here per say, it's far from the national parks, mountains, not on the coast. It's just a big sprawling ugly city built in the middle of the desert.
