Adam Sandler is one hilarious man. He's done great but more than anything, humorous roles in the Wedding Singer, Happy Gilmore, SNL, etc. My favorite thing he did on SNL was the Red-Hooded Sweatshirt song. I especially loved his Opera Man performance at the Concert for New York several weeks after the attacks. He provides excellent comedy in his Channukah songs, too. He even made his own CD They're All Gonna Laugh at You. Sandler is quite possibly the funniest man alive.
