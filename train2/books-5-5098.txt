This is one of my favourite books. At its heart is the conviction that Man has a right to his own life and happiness on this Earth. I love this book to death, and it is so much more empowering than all of that anti- hero drivel that is floating around bookstores today. Long live logic, Ayn Rand's legacy and the ego.
