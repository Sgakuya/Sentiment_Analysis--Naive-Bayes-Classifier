Rob Reiner has always been one of my favorite directors. He's so versatile as a director. He directed the compelling dramas A Few Good Men and Ghosts of Mississippi . Then he moved on to the comedy, This is Spinal Tap . Then we've got the children's movie, The Princess Bride . The romantic comedies, When Harry Met Sally and The American President . Let's not forget the chilling film, Misery starring Kathy Bates. Rob Reiner has easily proved himself to be a fine director, and a versatile one at that, in my eyes.
