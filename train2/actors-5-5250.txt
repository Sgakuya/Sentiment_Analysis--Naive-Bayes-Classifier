Danny DeVito is a wonderful actor who deserves to be so much higher up on this list. Every single one of DeVito's roles have been so believable because od DeVito's amazing acting skills. He's so versatile he can play just about any sort of role. His performance in Jack the Bear as the single father whose children are terrified by the next door neighbor (played wonderfully by Gary Sinise). He was also quite impressive in Rennaisance Man , which was probably his great performance in my view. He showed his comedic side in Twins and as the voice of Rocks the dog in Look Who's Talking Now . Batman Returns , Matilda and Mars Attacks were all great performances by this amazingly talented actor.
