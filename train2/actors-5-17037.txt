Nancy Lee Grahn, is one of the finest actresses of the daytime Genre. I give her kudos for her great work ethic, because after the travesty her character has been dealt by the shoddy writing team of Guza and Pratt, I'd be on the unemployment line myself. She plays Alexis as venerable, independent, devoted, and yet fragile all rolled into one complex character and I feel the characters emotions because of Nancy's brilliant Portrayal.
