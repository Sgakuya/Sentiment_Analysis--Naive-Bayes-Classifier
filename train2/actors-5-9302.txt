I loved her in 'Misery;' I loved her in 'Dolores Claiborne;' and in many other movies. She is my favorite actress. She may not be beautiful and skinny (like some may prefer), but she is the best of the best when it comes to acting and that's all that really matters. I wish she could play in more S. King adaptations - she alone has the ability to make them into masterpieces.
