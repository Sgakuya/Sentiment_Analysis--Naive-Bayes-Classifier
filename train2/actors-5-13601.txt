I love Jen for so many reasons! 1. Friends is the BEST show to ever air! It's so funny and unique, no show will ever replace it, and no actress can replace Jen as Rachel. 2. She's pretty and her hair is gorgeous. Who doesn't wanna look like Jen?!3. She has a great body! 4. She has so much talent, after all she's done 8+ years in Friends, and still going strong! 5. She looks great even as she gets older! 6. She married Brad;). 7. She get's to work with 5 of the coolest people in America! I can go on and on about Jen...overall, a great actress and the prettiest girl in the world!
