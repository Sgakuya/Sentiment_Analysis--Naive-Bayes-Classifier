Philips products are second rate. I had a t.v. go out in seven months for no reason, and I had a fairly expensive DVD player of theirs that quit playing the newer movies, again for no apparent reason. I contacted their customer service on two different occasions, and they lied to me both times. I turned them in to the Better Business Bureau, to no avail. They will not stand by their products. This is supposed to be America, but I felt like I was in Communist Russia after getting that kind of screwing.
