If I gave the director of Apocalypse Now and The Godfather anything less than five stars, I'd be afraid that a lightning bolt would strike me down the next time I walked outside. I'd probably deserve it. Have you ever seen the documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now ? It really gives you an appreciation for how hard Coppola worked on the film and how much of himself he put into it. He had all kinds of problems getting it made, and he had to put up a lot of his own money. But he had a vision, and he was gutsy and stubborn enough to steamroll over every obstacle in his way. And with The Godfather, Coppola added a second masterpiece to his resume, cementing his reputation as a genius. Sure, he also directed unremarkable pictures like Peggy Sue Got Married, but so what? The guy is a legend.
