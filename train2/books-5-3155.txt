This is a masterpiece of horror, on a par with the film and probably better. This story of a young girl being posessed by a demon is well known due to the movie of the same name, but this book had been a HUGE bestseller prior to the movie being made. It's no wonder: I read this story over ten years ago and after seeing the movie, yet I still remember how white my knuckles were while reading this superior novel. Blatty was never able to duplicate this triumph, and other novels I've tried to read from him were average at best (I can only think of one, Legion - a very weak sequel)
