Helen Hunt is very talented. I've seen many of her movies, including some of her older ones (loved Girls Just Want To Have Fun...). She was so great as Jamie Buchman in Mad About You! Also, she brought to life roles in As Good and Pay it Forward. Her acting seems real as does she, unlike a lot of actresses today!
