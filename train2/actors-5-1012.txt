He is a phenomenal actor who has a really broad range! He is good at both comedy and Drama! He definitely deserved the two oscars that he won! Whenever I'm down I always watch one of his comedies either Big, Turner and Hooch, A League of Their own, Sleepless in Seattle or You've Got Mail! I'll laugh and laugh and feel much better afterward! He was also great in Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and Apollo 13!
