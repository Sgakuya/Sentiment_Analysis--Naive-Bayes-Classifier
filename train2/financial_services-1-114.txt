Unfortunately with Wells Fargo, they have more problems than just their outrageous overdraft fees. To start from the beginning, I had a free student checking account with them under my father's account. They 'accidentally' charged a monthly fee that caused several of my purchases to overdraw, resulting in almost $100 in overdraft fees. Fortunately the problem was resolved but not after a nasty battle with the bank tellers just to see a manager. I closed the account a year ago when I moved out of the area (to where there are no Wells Fargo branches close to me) only to find out that there is yet another $37 in fees. They said that since Paypal pinged my account, it reopened the account! Meaning that someone could steal account numbers and if transactions on these closed accounts were echoed back to the bank, the account would reopen to honor the charges. (So I hear from one Wells Fargo employee.. I tend to get conflicting stories). I have yet to speak to someone who can explain to me why the account was reopened and why I am being charged. Second, I am in a tiff with Wells Fargo Auto Finance. I have my original loan contract stating the monthly payments, etc. Come to find out on my credit report that Wells Fargo closed my first loan out and redid another loan with a higher payoff amount and an increased monthly payment! All of this was done without notification to me or my co-signer and I am currently seeking a lawyer to investigate this. I chanced upon this site doing a little research on Wells Fargo as I have encountered many individuals who have had nothing but problems with them and their rude staff. My biggest problem is that the only physical Wells Fargo branch in this area does not have access to my loan information (to which I do not understand why) and the only way to see a copy of my purported loan contract with Wells Fargo, other than playing fax and phone tag, is to go to Philadelphia, where apparently they have access to my auto loan info! Absurd.
