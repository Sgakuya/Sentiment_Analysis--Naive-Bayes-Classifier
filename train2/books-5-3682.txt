I was born in a Communist country, and this prophetic book describes perefectly- in allegory and chilling fact- the conditions of life in a totalitarian regime. The theme of mass mind-control is especially treated with precision and powerful rhetoric. A must-read for all would-be Communists in Berkeley and elsewhere, so they might become careful of what they wish for.
