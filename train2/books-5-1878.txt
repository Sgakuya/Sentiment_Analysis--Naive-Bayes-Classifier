I've been collecting the Love Is... comic panel since 1993, which is when I first found out about it, I love it! Wish they'd bring back more merchandise to the US, but other than that, (to me), this is the best comic out there. (Oh I'd love to see it done in color in the US, as it is done in some other countries, even if only for the Sunday paper. Just a thought.) Collecting the Love Is... panel can be a great hobby it can also be quite addicting, especially once you find the merchandise that IS out there. Thanks Kim for this gift, thanks even more to her son, Stefano, who has kept it going since she passed away in 1997. :-) Love is patient, Love is kind...Love never ends 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 I hope the Love Is... panel never ends! :-D (Side note: The Love Is... panel was scheduled to no longer be a feature of the 'Los Angeles Times' effective April 20, 1995. However, due to the high volume of letters phone calls the Times received from the Love Is... fans out there, such as my father myself, they decided to continue to run it in their paper. Thanks to all who wrote or phoned in to the Times to keep it alive!) :-D
