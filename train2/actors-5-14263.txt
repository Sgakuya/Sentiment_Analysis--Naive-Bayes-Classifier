I love Melanie & her films. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Working Girl because she was great in that movie. Her eyes were very expressive & she looked adorable (I find the baby voice & throat clearing endearing & real). She gives an excellent performance in all her films. Yes she played the hooker with a heart of gold in Milk Money, but she really gave that character her all. She also played a cop in A Stranger Among Us. She can do it all! Thriller/suspense (Pacific Heights), drama (Lolita), comedy (Two Much, Cecil B. Demented), & she appeared on Broadway in Chicago. Granted, she has gotten carried away with the plastic surgery, & she needs to stop! What was so appealing about her early on (Body Double, Something Wild, Working Girl) was that she was pretty with flaws & sexy without a gym bod. I will continue to watch & enjoy all the films she's in.
