Sandra Bullock is not an actress. she cant even do a dramatic role. she just falls down or gets hit in the head for a cheap and stupid laugh. she has no charm or likeability. i hate how she goes around acting like she is so down-to-earth and normal when she isnt. i even heard her say im the worst celeb . puh-leez, she owns four houses, almost never leaves them and almost never signs autographs. she is concieted, stuck-up, and untalented.
