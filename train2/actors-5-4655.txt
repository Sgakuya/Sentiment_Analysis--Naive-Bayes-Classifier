I like him very much, not just because he's a very talented comedian, but also because bhe's a very talented actor. His comedy is just a disguise for the great actor he is. He's the only one who can grab you to the screen while he's making an insane effort to say that a pen is blue (in Liar liar liar). In other words, he's fantastic.
