Piece of junk. Had good dealer service but, I got to know them on a first name basis. Power engine-great. Body will rust in unexpected places and suspension will cost you your first born plus your left arm. Resale value will probably be about half of what you still owe. But Japanese, they don't use labor unions (maximum pay and best working conditions for minimum work), and they still put pride into anything they make, Cameras, electronics, machinery etc.
