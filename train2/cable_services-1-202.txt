Terrible customer service. No or low signal for 28 out of 31 days. I wanted to cancel the service after 2 weeks because on being on terminal hold (multiple times) and no/low signal, but was talked into staying until a rep could come out and see if it's faulty equipment or not. So the install guys come out (after missing the first appt. and then coming out a week late, he just showed up!) They say the equipment is fine and that they are uninstalling Voom equipment alot these days for the same reason (they install direct tv and dish network as well) So I called back to cancel my service (this was in June). I still get billed every month since I cancelled by service, and every month I call to let them know this and every month they say it's a clitch in the system and will be corrected (I just got my Aug bill yesterday) And remeber when I wanted to cancel after two weeks? But stayed on to have a tech look @ the equip? They charged me an extra month of service because I stayed on 4 days after the billing cycle was made.Even though I did not have service! The only reason I stayed on past the billing cycle (and why isn't the billing cycle the same as a month?)was because the rep asked me to give then another chance...... So I will finish writing this letter and call them up one more time and see if they correct the billing problem..... P L E A S E STAY AWAY FROM THIS SERVICE!!! P.s. I don't live in the boondocks, I live in the Tampa/Clearwater area of Florida and my neighbors have other satellite service and they don't lose their signal.
