First of all, I will say that Halle IS gorgeous! She also knows how to look like a movie star---a very stylish dresser. But, she has turned me off with this Academy award speech. To find out that she is so much about the deprived black woman cause is very disappointing.--and just as I was beginning to appreciate her acting. The academy chose her as best actress ,,,not best black, biracial, or multiracial. She mentioned something about a door being opened to african americans,,,well,,,no--its been open. She simply is the one to walk through it. And, she seems to forget she IS half white. Her white mother raised her, her black father has no relationship with her. I am sure that if I were Halle,,and chose to only acknowledge my white roots, I would be labeled a racist!!--so think about THAT!
