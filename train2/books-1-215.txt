Wow, another research paper, excuse me, book on Thomas Jefferson. As though Jefferson's Fisher documented actions leave something to be discovered about this most well-lit figure in our National tradition. The author pretends however, to expand the trove of human knowledge, but fails to add anything except to his own ego. The one says it all.
