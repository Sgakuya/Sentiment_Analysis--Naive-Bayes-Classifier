I recently purchased a jeep grand cherokee overland with the new quadre drive system. We have had our first snowfall and had great difficulty coming to a stop or even staying straight on the road. The rear end seams too light and fishtales. I am driving extremely cautious and slow in snowy weather as I am not sure that my vehicle will stop. My husband took it for a test run in bad weather and experienced the same thing. I have had an all-wheel drive vehicle before and found it fabulous. The Jeep just doesn't compare. I am also finding it a nuisance to have oil changed so often. I have driven volvo's for many years and always felt safe when driving and was sure that I could stop. It is only 3 months old and have had problems with not having any exterior lights and a few other annoyances that are starting to irk me.
