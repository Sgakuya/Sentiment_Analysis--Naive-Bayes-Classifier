Hi All, I have had a 99 GC Laredo 57K miles. While the vehicle was under waranty, it was in the shop more often than my 91 Mazda. Too many electrical problems. No there's is a new wave of leakages (differential and/or transfer case). To Add on to my woes, the rubber lining that prevents wind noise is deriorating soon. Its a crappy vehicle, never buying another Jeep product :(
