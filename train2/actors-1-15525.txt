Mischa Barton is the worst actress in the world. I LOVE the OC, but her character totally ruins the show for me!She delivers her lines with absalutely no emotion...her voice + accent are annoying, and all her lines sound over-rehearsed and monotonous. she's a terrible actress and completely ruins the show and the other characters. Its too bad they cast her as Marissa when there are hundreds of other actresses that can do a much better job! I don't know what they were thinking.. i never thought she was attractive and the fact that she's totally talent-less just makes her that much more unappealing!
