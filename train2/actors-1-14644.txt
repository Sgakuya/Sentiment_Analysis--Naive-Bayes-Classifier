Yuk!! Cow is it possible for this horrific creature to have scammed her way to the top of the Holywood heap with almoost no talent whatsoever, riding the backs of other, moore talented people (Kurt Cobain, Hole's other band members, etc). She was a goldbricking groupie back in London in the early 80's, when she tried to infiltrate groups like The Clash, and managed to get herself cast in Straight To Hell and Sid and Nancy. She shoulda played Nancy, 'cause her and Nancy Spungen were a lot alike. Vile and just plain icky. :=8P
