Every now and then something for charity or just a good thing will be in the paper (in the back usally) about Cher. She is the kind of person who does things not for the thanks but just to help out, but that wont sell papers. She is a wonderful performer with a great heart. I have been a fan of hers from the 70's, that doesnt mean I think she is perfect I just think she is more under rated than she should be. All things concidered I had to give her 5 stars.
