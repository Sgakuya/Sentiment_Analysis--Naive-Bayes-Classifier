As second owners, we find ourselves reliving the nightmares of the first owner! Transmissions replaced once under warranty, with us at 68,000. Head gasket replaced once under secret warranty at 58,000 and again by us at 69,000. Timing belt cover leaks too. HOWEVER, maybe all the complaining is having an effect-Ford Cust Serv. authorized an extended warranty that will replace our whole engine for $500. Now, if they'll only take the thing in on a trade!
