This Latino has NO respect for Jennifer Lopez. The only movie she was in that I liked was Selena, and she was kind of playing herself, so I don't know how much stock you can put into this. Also, she openly admitted on a radio show that she does not give any money to any charities but then tries to represent Latinos. Look- if you try to represent, you have to give BACK to the community ( don't you have enough money?) and until you do, please SPARE me your Jenny from the Block Nonsense. No talent , arrogance, and falsely claims to represent Latinos. 1 star for me.
