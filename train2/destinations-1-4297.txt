Went to LA on a connecting flight. Just from the edgy people I met on the flight and in the airport, I believe every bad thing rateitall people have said on this site. I truly feel for people that got caught up in this cesspool. Well, I guess if you're from LA and live in the rich parts, this place is great for you. But for real human beings that aren't from here, stay away. I had too many stereotypes of LA flying in, and too many of them were coming true, from the way my seatmates acted, to the final landing approach...through about 1 mile of smog. I used to live somewhere with terrible people, and this place was just giving me similar vibes. I value one complainer over 10 ravers anyday...and oddly enough, most of the reviewers here hate this place. Bad sign! You have been warned!
