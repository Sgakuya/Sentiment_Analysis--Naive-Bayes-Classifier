Considering this states ongoing battle against 'science' in evolution, and some anti gay church from Kansas spreading hate against gays in New England (they made a special trip to Mass. from Kansas)- it seems to prove that this state is about 100 years OR MORE in the past. Sorry to say this state seems to have a large amount of intolerance and ignorance sprinkled with hypocrisy. Backward and dumb.
