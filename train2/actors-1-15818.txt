He is a complete and total waste of air time. He couldn't act his way out of a very wet paper bag. He has no chemistry with any of the female cast members. He is still and knows little if no emotion. He does convey any kind of connection with the audience. All he is is a pretty face and good hair. Actors like him are a dime a dozen in Hollywood.
