My absolute FAVORITE Mom!!! I say this because I can't seem to find any of her earlier work (where I'll bet she was even more muffiny). Best nose on TV (seriously), and was always hamstrung by wardrobe. Languishes in made-for-TV stuff, but at least doesn't have to put up with that wingnut Hypocrite Cameron anymore.
