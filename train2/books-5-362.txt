This is a book that provokes the mind, the simple story is linked to your life if you make a link to it. Like Sam pointed out, it's not merely about careers or business, it doesn't follow a permanent flow, interpreting it differs from person to person. Reading the discussion part might be either leading or misleading but nonetheless the book has a core that is inevitably effective and it indeed was for me. It's about living life!
