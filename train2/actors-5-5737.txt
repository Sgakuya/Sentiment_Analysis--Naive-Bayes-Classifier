It is such a shame that most people flock around the pretty boys while completely overlooking or under-appreciating REAL talent. I cann ot believe that people have become so blind to what true acting ability is. Mr. Curry has to be one of the most clever actors on screen. Completely self-possessed, all others fade in comparison. Anyway, who needs those pretty boys when you have someone like Mr. Curry with his charm and eloquence!
