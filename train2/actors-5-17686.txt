I have to say through the years of soap watching, particulary days, that Alison has to be one of the most talented and gifted actresses I have ever seen! Coming from someone who has battled weight my whole life, watching her lose all that and keep her sunny disposition is an inspiration. She is beautiful! And a terrific actress! She will go far with her talent I just know it! She needs better story lines on days though. Who cares about the Dimeras? Sami is good and we love to watch her!
