Doritos taste disgusting! Unfortunately, many people tend to assume that everyone likes them, but they turn my stomach. To be fair, I haven't tasted all of them and the Nacho Doritos are edible if a person is desperate for a snack of any kind. I'll take cheese curls, Fritos, or even plain potato chips as an alternative to Doritos any day.
