While Jason Isaacs has most recently gained attention with his role as Colonel Tavington in The Patriot, it's the more subtle roles and performances that I have found impressive. He is a wonderfully versatile actor who has a knack of using every word and motion to further embellish his characters but never appearing over-the-top which would be easy to do given the horrendously villanous roles he's had to fill. But at the same time, he's just as capable of becoming a character who is incredibly vulnerable or caring for example and just as believable. Incredible talent I'm glad to have finally noticed.
