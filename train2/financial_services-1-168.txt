This has been the worst business i have ever had to deal with with NSF AND USF fees out the butt and a service department that is an insult to the word service, I hate this bank. The in branch services (ie the tellers and other morons) are the slowest i have ever had to deal with. Today I am going down to threaten them to try and get my account zeroed out and then i'm going to close it.
