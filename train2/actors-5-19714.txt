i think that david is a terrific actor-and if his caracter is a nerd is not his fault he is just acting but if some people don't really like him it's maybe because hi is doing a great job whit the ross caracter-and he is not that ugly it's justa that haircut. the bad thing about ross it's that at the begining of the tv show he was this inteligent paleontologist and them the creators damage his caracter making him look stupid when he really should be the main male caracter of FRIENDS as jennifer aniston is the main female caracter.
