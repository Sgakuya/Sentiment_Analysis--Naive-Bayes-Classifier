I just finished reading GWTW for the 2nd time. I was enthralled and could not put it down. I was particularly titillated by the description of the drunken Rhett sweeping Scarlett up the stairs for some hard core euphemisms. I had no sympathy for Scarlett at the end. She got what she deserved for being so mean to poor Rhett. As for Ashley Wilkes, why would she be so intent on milquetoast like him? There is a sequal, Scarlett , but I refuse to read it since it was not written by Margaret Mitchell. I prefer to think of the story as she intended it. Not all tales have a happy ending. If you think the movie is great, read the book.
