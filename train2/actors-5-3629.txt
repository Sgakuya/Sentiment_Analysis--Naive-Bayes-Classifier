I feel that Alan Rickman is one of the best actors that I've seen in years. In these days were all you have to be is young and thin to get you face plastered all over the place it is good to see someone who not only looks like they can act, but can act and do it well. And what a beautiful,expressive face. Keep up the wonderful work Mr. Rickman. Do more romantic work.
