I never would have thought this girl who started with such films as Buffy the Vampire Slayer would some day be a two time Oscar winner. It just goes to show you, you can't judge a person too harshly at the beginning of their career, they just might become the next Hilary Swank. I am happy for her, she deserves this recognition. She was wonderful in just about every role after Buffy.
