I did test drive this vehicle and was not impressed. I thought the fit and finish was poor. I had a 1998 Jeep GC (my wife's) coming off lease that was the truck from hell. Trany problems, front brake pads changed every 6,000 miles, rear end problems and on and on...... I then find out there are many other owners with the same problems. Problems that Jeep refuses to correct. I can't tell you how much time I wasted arguing to get repairs under warranty done, time waiting for parts and time for the repairs to be corrected. Never again. As for the Liberty, it had the same 'feel' to it as the GC. Cheap. I decided on the Toyota Highlander. From the extensive homework I've done it should be a great vehicle. I love the look and feel of this truck and it's priced very reasonable.
