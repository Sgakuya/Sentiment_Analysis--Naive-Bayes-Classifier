I know dumb bags who go to Yale, just because one or both of their parents went there. It's all about legacy. By the way, take a look at the Bush's family. Little Curious George Jr. (the dumb monster in the oval office) got into Yale with an 1130 on his SAT! What a miracle! Also if you're heading there as a new student, tell your parents to buy you a bullet proof vest. It's worst the investment!
