Nashville loves this local girl-turned-superstar! She's given us plenty of reason, what with her ability to open a film, stay married, and raise a seemingly happy, well-adjusted child. Sounds more Southern than Southern CA Hollywood style, huh:)? Be sure and catch her in the welcoming video on the Declaration Of Independence Road Trip. Beautiful job.
