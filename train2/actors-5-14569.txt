Patricia Arquette deserves bigger, better roles. She was excellent in Beyond Rangoon, Stigmata, Hi-Lo Country, True Romance, Bringing Out The Dead, Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent. You can't blame the disastrous Lost Highway on her, that was all David Lynch there. She's talented, underrated and stunningly beautiful.
