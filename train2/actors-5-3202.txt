Mr. Russell Crowe is the best actor I have seen in years. His acting ability mesmerizes even the most distracted movie-goer. He is like a chameleon swiftly changing from one character to another. I wish Mr. Russell Crowe the best in the world and may he continues to delight us with his astonishing performances.
