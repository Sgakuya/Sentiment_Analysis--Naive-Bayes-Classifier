Possibly the best book ever written, Mr. James Clavell begins his amzing Asian Saga. With 1,152 pages, it will keep the reader interested for a long time. Not a single word should be left out, however. The story follows John Blackthorne, an English pilot of the Dutch ship ERASMUS. A storm attacks the ships and sends Blackthorne, along with his crew of sick and dying Dutchmen and Britons, whirling towards fuedal Japan. There, he is caught between two warlords, Toronaga and Ishido. His first thought of the Japans as a vulgar, bastard breeding territory of men who do not value life soon becomes a vision of a superior culture to his own.....and he realizes that it is the Japans that make sense, not himself or his country. Before you pick up this highly reccomended book, prepare yourself to be sent back to fuedal Japan, a trip that will leave an everlasting mark on your way of viewing all culture.
