Peanuts is a classic. I grew up reading the Peanuts strips.they are kind of a nostalgia to me. I also watched the specials on tv. Charlie Brown Christmas, and It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown are shows my kids now watch and enjoy. I loved reading about Snoopy's adventures and his wild imagination. And Poor Charlie Brown, who always seemed to have to bad luck. I know I could relate to Charlie Brown.I am glad that my kids are now Peanuts fans.
