It be's my favrit book this day...Many writers are observant. David Sedaris is special because he is observant and funny. Granted, I've heard nothing but acclaim for his work (both as author orator) before I'd read any of it. But now, having experienced it, I concur wholeheartedly and feel that he deserves all the kudos. Get the audio versions of his books too while you're at it. They are an added dimension that shouldn't be excluded when experiencing all that is David Sedaris.
