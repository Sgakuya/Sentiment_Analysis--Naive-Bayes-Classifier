When I was a teenager I went to see Trading Places at our local mall. From that day I have been a fan, but lately (she was still hot in Eraser) she hasn't been in much (I dont count that Freaky Friday B.S.). Good luck Jamie, and please, PLEASE don't mess yourself up with plastic surgery, and don't ever, EVER get fake boobs. That will ruin your natural beauty.
