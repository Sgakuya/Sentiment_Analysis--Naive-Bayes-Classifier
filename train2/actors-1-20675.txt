I don't have anything against Ellen her self it is what she represents, I'm a Christian and I know God didn't make us like that. She has a soul and God loves her just like He does me. I've been a viewer of WHNT all my life , I'm 37 now. Everyday that is the only channel I watch except when her show comes I turn it off. I had rather see the NEWS first at 4:30.
