As an owner of Jeep products since 1992...I must have received at least 25 recalls. Do yourself a favour and buy Ford or GM . I have a 2002 Ford Explorer now and it is GREAT. The Jeep looks nice to others as you drive it back and forth to the dealer for repairs. Thats where I put on all the mileage on my Jeeps.
