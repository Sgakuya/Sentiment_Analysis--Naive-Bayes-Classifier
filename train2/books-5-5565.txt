cliche time - Don't confuse the art with the artist. Wonderful read. People that think it's sick are sick themselves. My library won't carry this book because it offended christians. My question is: what drew christians to read this book in the first place, and why do they care if I read it? You see, I'm not a sick freak that can be influenced by a book to murder......like SOME PEOPLE! It's entertainment, ding bats. Shut up and stay out of my library. So bitter. You can't allow yourselves to enjoy it, so I shouldn't either? Go reserve the 'Left Behind' series at your library, if you wanna call it that, and stay the HECK out of my preferences. I don't have $30 bucks to read every book I want to.
