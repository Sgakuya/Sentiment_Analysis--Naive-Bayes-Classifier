I want to comment on the 'telus plant' who boldly said to others having issues with telus to 'get a life'. Well what can one say. You either have money to burn or dont understand the dynamics of unidirectional corporate capitalization. If your not happy to find out that the company you are so attached to is not GIVING ITS WORTH IN CA$H...perhaps YOU need to get a life and stay off the road of those trying to make it better for others! kiss :)
