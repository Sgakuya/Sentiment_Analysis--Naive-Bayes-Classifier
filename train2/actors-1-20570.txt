I think this chick is a victim of circumstance. Somehow someone was diluted into thinking she had some talent or beauty, and gave her work. I feel bad for her- someday she's going to be asked to act her way out of a paper bag and she won't be able to do it. As for that thing she does with her head when she talks, yeah, i agree, she needs to get that checked out. i would also suggest a breast reduction, for health reasons, of course. Wouldn't want her to get a bad back and have to stop working! (yeah right). So, basically i think her looks are highly overrated and her acting makes me sleepy. She giggles too much- a sure sign of a low IQ. Hope you find this helpful! :)
