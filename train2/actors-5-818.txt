Ahh, Sexy Rexy as he was often referred to I could feel his charisma penetrate the screen even before I turned twelve. It was undeniable. My favorite Harrison movie was The Ghost and Mrs. Muir a lonely young widow falls in love with the ghost of a sea captain who once owned her home. What a wonderful gothically romantic idea in the first place and it was Harrison that made it both believable and memorable. I enjoyed him as Henry Higgins and in several other roles and always thought of him as maybe not one of the top 10, but a very good actor. I have heard tales that in real life he was kind of a stinker to work and live with and had several failed marriages and ticked off colleagues to prove it.
