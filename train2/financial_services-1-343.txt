Bank one sets up their debit card to get you. They kept approving me for debit charges knowing that I had insufficient funds. They gladly charged me twenty nine dollar nsf fees for less than ten dollar items. I begged the bank manager for help, wouldn't budge. Then the district manager did totally blew me off. I called him four times leaving messages to please call me. I finally called and chose zero enough times to get an administrative assistant to answer the phone. They would not adjust one single charge. They have no heart. This is the new bank one. This is a bank that has no heart.
