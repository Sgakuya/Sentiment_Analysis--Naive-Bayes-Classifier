I'm pretty new to the freeware distribution. I started doctorate studies and for this I had to learn a little more about Linux. At first, I had a real hard time to understand the system. So I took the RUNNING LINUX and it gave me alot of help. This book is absolutely captivating. I cannot keep myself away from it. It gives me alot of useful tips. Thank you so much for writing such a book. I beleive that everyone that want to start with Linux should read this book.
