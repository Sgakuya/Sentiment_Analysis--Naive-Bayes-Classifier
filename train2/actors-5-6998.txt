I think that Wes is the most talented young actor today, and I am very glad to see him breaking through in a more serious movie (compared to high school movies) Im sure he will become a very well-known actor, and his performance in American Beauty was spectacular. He made you feel like you were right there in the movie with him. I love his work and plan to see all the movies he makes. Congrats Wes, keep up the EXCELLENT work! -Sara
