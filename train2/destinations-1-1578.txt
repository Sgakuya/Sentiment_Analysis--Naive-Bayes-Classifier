Long, dreary winter days and not enough sunshine are not high on my list. Lillehammer and the Olympics not withstanding, I can't get too whipped up about a nation that is shaped like a spoon. Expensive to live in. For all its professed tolerance, there has been a dramatic increase in non-white, non-Christians into Scandinavia, and the cracks of its tolerant facade are starting to show through. Witness Svee-den, Feen-lont and Dayne-a-mark.
