They may say that their service gives you permission to speak freely,, but that's B.S. because their service is so crappy, you CAN'T TALK AT ALL. I have never been able to have an entire conversation without someone hanging up because they can only hear every other word I'm saying. THIS IS THE WORST CELL PHONE SERVICE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.
