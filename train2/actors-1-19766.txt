He would be a good actor if he didn't do All these stupid ass kiddie films! He only like made 3 films that were of REAL SUBSTANCE! He is very bland in his acting. He will never be taken seriously. He's annoying with his LIFE IS PERFECT NONSENSE. He goes off making films that ALWAYS HAS A HAPPY ENDING! The perfect world movies! Maybe if he started acting whenn he was 18, maybe he would taken seriously! JTT, get a spine!
