Salma Hayek is one of the most beautiful girls in hollywood. Sure she can't speak perfect english, but can you speak perfect spanish?. At least she studies and understand so that makes her bilingual, that is more than alot of people I know. Anyway she is a great actress in Mexico, English is just not her primary language... imagine if it was... good bye to the rest, hello the best.
