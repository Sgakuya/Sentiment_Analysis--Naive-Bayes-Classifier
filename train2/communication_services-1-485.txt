In 2001, I made the final payment on my cell phone and then closed the account. I then received a letter from a collection agency telling me that I owed Alltel $977.00. I have spent the last 2 1/2 years being told that they are sorry and will have it removed completely from my credit reports. I have been told over and over again that the problem will be corrected only to dicover that it still remains on all three credit reports. I have obtained legal counsel and am now currently suing for damages.
