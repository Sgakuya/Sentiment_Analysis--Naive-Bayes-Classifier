The Lone Star State- home of the Alamo, and so much more rated this low? But why? Must be some good reasons. Poor quality of life, poor educational system, poor enviornment, high crime rate, poor health for its citizens, low quality of life for children- oh well Bush did something as Governor, as he did as Prez- NOTHING.
