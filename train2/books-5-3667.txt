One of the greatest novels dealing with governmental oppression. Parallels cam be drawn between Orwell's fictional society and our society today. Big Brother is watching has become a reality in today's society obsessed with watching people with cameras and pseudo people everywhere. 1984 illustrates what could happen if we don't ask critical questions about technology and privacy today.
