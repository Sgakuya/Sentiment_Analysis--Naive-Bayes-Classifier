Bill Cosby is awesome. If anybody saw his townhall meeting with the Rainbow Coalition in Chicago this summer, it was so funny. He asked the moderator not to put Jesse Jackson on after him, because Jesse was going to start crying. I thought he was making a Bill Cosby kind of joke, but about fell off my chair when, not ten minutes later, Jesse Jackson (who followed Bill) took out his hankie and started dabbing at his eyes. I love Bill Cosby. I wish he had been as outspoken years ago as he is now.
