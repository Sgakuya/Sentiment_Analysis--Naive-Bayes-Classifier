Lima is the ugliest, most depressing city I've ever seen. Even for the excitable traveler it is a serious let-down, and I recommend skipping right over it. The architecture leaves much to be desired (except in a few areas where it could be considered interesting -- just use a little imagination to sense what the buildings might look like under 9 inches of exhaust build-up). The climate? DANK. There is a constant, wet haze hanging over the city, even on the hottest days. You'll need a shower after a walk around the block. But since the tap water smells as foul as the river and a shower leaves you feeling like you've just surfaced from an oil spill, it might be a better idea to douse yourself with bottled water -- or go straight from the airport to the nearest bus station and get out of town.
