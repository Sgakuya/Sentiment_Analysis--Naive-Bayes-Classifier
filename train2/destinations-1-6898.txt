Lots of beautiful pine trees. Other than that, a trip to Mississippi is pretty much a waste of time. Plus, when I was driving through on the interstate, the state trooper followed me for a few miles I guess because I had out of state plates. I was not speeding or in any other way acting suspicious. It gave me the creeps.
