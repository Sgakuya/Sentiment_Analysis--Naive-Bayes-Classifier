I hate the Windstar. We have had a blown head gasket and transmission problems in the first 4 years of ownership. Also numerous other small problems. I will never buy another Ford let alone a Windstar. Ford has no concern for the consumer. Their customer service is worse than terrible. I would rate this van worse than terrible also. I would give it 0 stars if possible.!
