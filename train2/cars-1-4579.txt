Its not a bad little truck. But my big thing is that If I want a decent amount of power, I have to get the supercharged engine. The interior feels cheap to me with that plastic feeling. I just don't feel the quality for the price. For the amount for a SC nissan I can get a bigger roomier Dakota with a powerful V8. Just my two cents. If you want a small truck for just putting around and good gas milege and pretty well built than get a Nissan
