What a terrible place to live. I moved from Nebraska to North Dakota and grew up in Denver, Colorado. The weaher here is wicked, North Dakota goes months occasionally with-out hitting zero. Fargo had a windchill in 1981 at -98 according to intellicast.com. The pay here is among the lowest in the nation, the price of food is very high and the customer service is always bad. No competition exists, so be prepared to pay much more than you would in a big city for everything, except for rent with reasonable because of the lack of demand for housing units. The people in North Dakota arent so rude but they are very racist, very xenopobic people. North Dakota State University is the most conservative campus in the nation and I have hung out at campus areas in 10 different states. Overall, if you want to live on mimimum wage, in a dumpy house and pay tons of money for food, electricity than by all means move to North Dakota.
