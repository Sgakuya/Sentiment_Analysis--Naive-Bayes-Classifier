No matter that her true talent is in her singing she has done wonders in the hollywood sene. She has done such features as Beaches, stella, for the boys, the wifes club, drowning mona...and in all of them she did a wonderful job...most fave of mine is Beaches where she plays pretty much her...in a way...she is a struggling actress who makes it and then breaks it then makes it as a singer...but all in all she is in this movie to show what true friendship is with Barbra Hershey and they do a wonderful job together so if you havent given her a chance you should...
