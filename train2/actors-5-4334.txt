My dream movie would star Gary Sinise, Steve Buscemi, and John Malkovich. Wouldn't matter what the topic was, just make it long, sit back, and let them work their magic.... Hard to believe Gary Sinise is (currently) #95 on this list. Do people really think Adam Sandler is a better actor??? What movies have they been watching?
