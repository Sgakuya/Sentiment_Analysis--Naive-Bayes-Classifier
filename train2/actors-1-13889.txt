Lothesome and irritating in the extreme, I have no idea why the business sees her as the lead actress of her generation - gimme a break! She is appallingly mediocre, and she almoost single-handedly ruined one of the MooCow's favorite films(Michael Collins) with her paper-thin, phoney acting. Worse, she looks like her brother Eric, only with breasts, and has a huge, almooost deformed mouth with unnaturally white choppers. She cowtinues to play the same role over and over(the winnsome new bride), yet she reaps in cowntless accolades. The MooCow is entirely mystified by her deification. SHe is a celebrity, not an actress. When will America figure out the difference?? :=8/
