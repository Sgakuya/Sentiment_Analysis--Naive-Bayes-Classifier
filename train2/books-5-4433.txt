I have loved this book since I was a child and my mom shared it with me. My copy of Little Women has been handed down through three generations of women, and someday I hope to give it/share it with my daughters. Little Women is a story that will never go out of style. The love and family bounds it shows us are the type of devotion and love we all hope will flourish among our families. The story makes you hope, dream, cry and love with every character. The Little Women in the story exhibit characters that we all aspire to. They exemplify the best in women regardless of time or place.
