Five star guarantee? Was not that way in my case. After searching the complaints, it does not seem to be that way for many others either. US Bank seems to be a rob the customers, cheat the employees, violate no matter what or how, to make money kind of bank. And they don't seem to care who they hurt in the process. Maybe US Bank should just spell it out; U Screwed Bank - five star screw guarantee. http://www.screwed-by-us-bank.info/
