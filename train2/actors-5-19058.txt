I loved him in The Agency, if only they would have focused on his character more and promoted him and Paige Turco I strongly believe we would have seen another season. After watching him on the closer this week I'm more convinced than ever he deserves 5 stars. He was excellent as the bad guy in this show. I can't wait to see his new show, which is set to be a midseason replacement In justice.
