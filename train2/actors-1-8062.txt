as much as i LOVE classic actresses & classic films, i never could stand Katherine Hepburn. That whole rich, snotty over-opinionated east coast attitude/persona along w/ that voice was enough to send me diving for the remote control the minute i saw her. I tend to love the more raw, down-to-earth broads, like barbara stanwyck, joan crawford, bette davis, liz taylor, joan blondell, shelly winters, susan hayward. Kate Hepburn--you can have her.
