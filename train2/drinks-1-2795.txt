Years ago Folger's coffee was a quality product. Today, if you a lucky, you may get a good 12 ounce bag of their beans about 20% of the time. I have called their toll free number and discussed this with the person that represents FOLGERS. There seems to be a lack of quality control due to the poor quality of coffee that I get almost every time I purchase thier product. Some of the beans have been bad enough that I have returned them to the store where I purchased them. I have also tried email and with both means of discussion all I have recieved is fancy double talk where they try to put a spin on my complaints. On several of my complaints they tried to make it fall back on me because I had a dirty coffee maker, or the water I used to make the coffee with was of poor quality, I didn't measure correctly, etc....I live in Memphis Tn. where we have some of the highest quality water in the world..I use a measuring spoon to make coffee and only 20% of the time do I get good coffee. When I open a bag of Folgers I can smell the difference in the good and bad coffee. I guess Folgers thinks most consumers are quiet stupid and can not tell the difference in good or bad coffee.
