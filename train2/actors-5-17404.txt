I think Deidre is fabulous...she's been a Diva for nearly 3 decades and is still turning heads....Her character has needed some work over the years but all soaps run into that...I really was impressed when I found out she was born male and underwent sexchange surgery to become the woman she is today...I say she is a terrific Lady and can only be as as good as the material that's written for her..
