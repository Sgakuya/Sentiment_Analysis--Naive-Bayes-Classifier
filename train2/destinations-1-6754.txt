Pretty mountains- nice scenary in the central and northern parts of the state- the southern part of the state- in the plain of the Snake R. is dry windy and rather dusty. Boise has a windblown clean and surreal look too it. However there are too many mormons- with their rather esoteric attitudes and it is way too white/ republican/conservative for me. Enough said- drive through and enjoy the view- and beware of the far right and their legions....
