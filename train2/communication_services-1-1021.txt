I recently got a bill for 547 dollars because the salesman flat out lied to me. He told me that there would be no roaming charges west of the mississippi. I took my phone back to idaho after school, is that west of the mississippi enough, and got slammed with bill because my night and weekend minutes apparently dont apply when im not using a cell one tower. now i have no money to return to school on. DONT GET CELL ONE!!!!!!
