It takes amazing talent to create a world. George Lucas has that gift, and it amazes me. He is most renowned for Star Wars , which is the best movie in the world in my opinion, he also created the world of Indiana Jones, and he is associated with the new Seventh Tower book series. In short, Mr. Lucas is definately one of the most talented filmmakers that ever existed.
