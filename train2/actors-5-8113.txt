Bette Davis is a genuine Hollywood legend, and would be one of our greatest actresses for 'All About Eve,' 1950, alone. But luckily, she made many excellent films. She gave two of her greatest screen performances for director William Wyler, in 'The Letter,' 1940, and 'The Little Foxes,' 1941. A great, great star.
