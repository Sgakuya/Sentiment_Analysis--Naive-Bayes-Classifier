I like him, he's honest! He's not just a great artist, but also a terrific guy. He hates Hollywood and that what makes me admire him the most. He manages to keep himself just the way he is. People say he's rude and full of sarcasm, but at least he never fakes himself. It's such a wonderful experience to witness his Oscar triumph. He deserves it!! I hope he'll continue to do great movies. He's such a picky in terms of choosing the movie roles. He's intelligent and that's rare.
