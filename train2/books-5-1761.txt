About as cute as they come, but that doesn't mean sicky-sweet. Here we find the main characters both relatable and unpredictable. If you don't mind an endearing kind of weirdness, Millie and the dragons are for you. If you're the quiet type, there's Ozy. Later episodes have art to rival Bill Watterson's. Just don't get hung up on why the cartoonist selected their species: there's a method, but for the most part, it's unimportant. (Hey, it worked for Pogo!)
