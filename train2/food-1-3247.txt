I just bought the Oriental Beef Stirfry and didn't even try it. There was a 31/2 inch long hair flowing through the rice and beef. Have written a complaint letter to Nestle, but have not yet had a response. Terrible quality assurance if this huge hair can get into a meal! I was so disgusted I will probably never buy this product again.
