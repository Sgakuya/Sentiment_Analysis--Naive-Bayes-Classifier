That might be good for those who like pseudo-historical, awfully long sagas about the so-called evil fighting the so-called good (or the other way, won't matter, really) in a form of one big plagiarism. All the stuf described in that book had already existed in a far better form - medieval and pre-medieval mythological stories. Mr. Tolkien definately lacked imagination but was a very meticulous writer instead - thousands of trivial and unmeaningful episodes. All in all that resembles Crouching tiger, hidden dragon - in it's pompous and pretentional style. Anyway, if you're more than 12 years of age, you're already far too old for that book.
