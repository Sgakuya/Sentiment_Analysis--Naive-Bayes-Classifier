The guy's awesome! It makes me sad just to see the low rating he has. I'd give the guy a 4 (he's not the BEST..but he's really good!), but that rating NEEDS to deperately go up, so I'll give him a five. Give him a break. It's just a show, guys, and no matter how bad some people think it is, he's one of the people that keep it alive. I don't care if some people don't like his character, I think he conveys it very smoothly and greatly. :)
