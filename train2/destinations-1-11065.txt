Arrived at waterpark and it was a county free week! All of the people that live in the county that Dolly Pardon grew up in was allowed into the park free. Well, I was a paying customer with my 2 grandchildren and after paying BIG bucks to gain entry into the park, the lines to each waterslide were more than a 30 minute wait just to go down one slide. We left after the grandkids saw that it was no fun standing in long lines. A very BAD day, not worth the gamble.
