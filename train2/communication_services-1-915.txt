The coverage is off and on...I can't depend on being able to be reached. They also gave me a long distance #! My phone didn't even work for the first 3 months, but it was impossible to get ahold of anyone. They insist they can't do anything about the phone #. Hopefully, I can get out of the contract. Either way, I would never go with AT&T no matter what great offer they have.
