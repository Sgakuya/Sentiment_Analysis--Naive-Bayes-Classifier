A beautiful piece of work, as long as it's in the original Middle English. Every translation I've ever seen loses most of the flavour and brilliance of the original. Reading it in Middle English is not particularly difficult (buy an edition with good footnotes) and it will reward the your effort. Chaucer's use of multiple viewpoints, his self-deprecating humour, the structure of the work, and the flow of his language make this one of the finest works in English literature.
