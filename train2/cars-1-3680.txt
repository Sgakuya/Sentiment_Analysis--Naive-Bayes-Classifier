we have a '91 blazer and a '93 blazer. never ever buy a Blazer from the 90's. Everything goes out quickly on them unless you're lucky. The breaks go quickly, the transmission has issues, the back window sqeaks and rattles, electronical things break, you're lucky if your A/C works for very long. Bad bad chevy! I don't know if the 2000 models are any better but save yourself a headache and some money and find something else.
