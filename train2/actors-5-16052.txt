Maurice is fantastic as Sonny Corinthos the brooding mobster because he has the dexterity to layer his character with sensitivity while keeping him complex and intense. Maurice also has a personal aura of sensuality that he brings to his character. With his great looks and talent is it any wonder that Maurice Benard is the lightning Rod of General Hospital!
