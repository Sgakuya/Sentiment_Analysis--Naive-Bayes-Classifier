Orwell s allegory of Stalin s Russia is quite impressive. I have always enjoyed the book, and find its content a bit chilling. In the past, many have tried to apply 1984 to the U.S. which has always been a stretch, but a comparison of his fictional world to the information and propaganda control systems put in place by many communist and dictatorial nations is quite accurate. I enjoy the book but am also frightened by it.
