a solid character actor w/a few opportunities to shine on his own, albeit in mostly mediocre films (footloose, stir of echoes). caught him the past December in an absolutely brilliant film called The Woodsman in which Bacon played a pedefiler released from prison after 12 years readjusting to life. I recommend this movie to everybody despite your beliefs/moral issues. it's well acted by the cast and plays so many sides of this coin...it's just worth watching. In a perfect world Bacon would be nominated for an oscar for this movie.
