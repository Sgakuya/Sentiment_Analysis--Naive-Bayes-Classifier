I never thought the day would come that an un talented and overrated person such as Hilary Duff would be rated higher over some other good actresses such as Susan Sarandon! Susan has been around longer then Hilary has been alive and has more talent in her thumb then in Hilary's whole body. Hilary is just a person who got lucky and now is going along with the trends who more then likely won't be around for much longer.
