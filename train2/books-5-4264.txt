I read this book about a year ago and it touched me very deeply. Tolstoy's beautifully written tale of love lost, hope lost is amazingly poignant. It's thought-provoking and heartbreaking, and countless other sweeping adjectives. In all, I very very highly recommend this simple love story to all romantics at heart.
