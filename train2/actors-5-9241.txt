One of the best. She is not an extremely atractive woman and has to rely on her talent to make it, and she has made it. She is a great actress and has made great movies. ABOUT SCHIMDT, FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, THE WATERBOY, and just about everything she has ever been in! Great Actress! And, always remember, you should have bought the squirrel!!
