Her Alexis is so likable and three-dimensional. I don't know how she does it. Usually, a character like hers, who is a genius, is not very likable, but, somehow, because of Ms. Grahn's own gifts, Alexis is arguably the most popular female character on the show. And, yet, she is very much as a genius character should be.
