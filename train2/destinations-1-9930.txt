I don't know why these are so popular among college students who smoke, outside of Marlboro Lights. I remember smoking some of these in college, and not only did the Camel Lights smell awful, but I felt like I wanted to vomit after smoking a couple! These cigs taught me to avoid smoking ANY Camel brand from now on!
