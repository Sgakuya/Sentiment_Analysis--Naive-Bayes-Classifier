Brilliant in almost every role. My two favorites are both military characters. As the captain in Pulp Fiction and the Sgt in Biloxi Blues. Anyone who can say the following and clearly be dead serious about it is a great actor: Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you. Absolutely hysterical.
