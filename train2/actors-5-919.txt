Yea, he's big, he's bad, but really he's just another guy with an amazing talent and devotion. Got his start with The Godfather and he has a great career behind him with very few mistakes. In his later movies it was as if he didn't need to act. He was cool, he knows it, we know it. And would you look at that- he can be Spanish, Italian, Cuban, whatever you need. One of the best actors ever. And a great person.
