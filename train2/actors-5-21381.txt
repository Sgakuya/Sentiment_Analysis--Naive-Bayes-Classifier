Frantastic. Her very tragic past (raped at gunpoint, cancer) and her way of overcominig them give me tons of respect for her. She totally doesn't feel sorry for herself and always puts her best foot forward. Also, one of the most beautiful woman out there. Voice, schmoice...she gets the last laugh as she can do it all the way to the bank. She worked hard for her success; she deserves it.
