One thought came to mind the first time I tried this diet soda (which was today at lunch): iiieewwwwwwwww LOL.... I don't know about you, but if I'm drinking a soda (diet or original), I want it to at least taste a little bit like soda. This stuff tastes like a can of chemicals. It doesn't even have a slight taste of Coke. The can should read Diet Chemicals not Diet Coke. Leave this one on the shelf or in the machine. Get a Diet Dr. Pepper. At least that tastes something like its name on the can.
