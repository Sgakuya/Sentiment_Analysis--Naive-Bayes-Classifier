Sally Field is a wonderful actor who is talented in every way. She's done it all throughout her career. She gave a wonderful performance in Places in the Heart . I thought that she was the perfect choice for Forrest's caring, yet somewhat slutty mother in Forrest Gump . My favorite line from that movie was from her : If God intended for everyone to be the same, he would've given everyone crippled legs.... or something of that sort. She was very likable in that film, as well as in Punchline with Tom Hanks and John Goodman. I thought that she was hilarious in that film. She great as the stressed, yet moody mother in Mrs. Doubtfire . And who can forget her performance as Sybal? She was also great in the thriller, An Eye for An Eye and as the not-so-caring mother in Where the Heart Is . In the final analysis, Sally Field has had a decorated career and is a wonderful actress and person.
