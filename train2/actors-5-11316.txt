Someone wrote that Juliette Binoche only made one film. That's ridiculous. Here is a partial list of her films: The Widow of Saint-Pierre Alice and Martin Chocolat [Seen] Code Inconnu: Recit Incomplet De Divers Voyages Children of the Century The English Patient [favorite film] A Couch in New York [seen] The Horseman on the Roof Red White Blue [seen] Damage [seen] Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights [seen] Women and Men 2 The Lovers on the Bridge The Unbearable Lightness of Being [seen] Bad Blood Rendez-Vous Binoche is my favorite actress, a luminous presence on the screen. She is not to be dismissed.
