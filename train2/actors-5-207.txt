As confused and troubled in his personal life as he was talented as a performer, Montgomery Clift was one of the most intense and compelling actors ever to grace the stage or screen. He could convey volumes with his eyes and facial expressions alone. And though he apparently much preferred the stage to making movies, as a life-long movie buff, I am very grateful for the films he did make. These films contain some of the best and most amazing performances to ever come out of Hollywood. Many actors deserve 5 stars, but none more than Monty!
