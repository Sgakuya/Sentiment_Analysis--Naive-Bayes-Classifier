What a wonderful idea GM had years back to produce a nice looking small car independent of the car herd. Sadly in the rush to quick profits they are now bubba sizing this brand instead of keeping the tradition that made them popular. How refreshing it would have been to see Saturn make small pickups or sporty small cars. Too bad Saturn has just took over for Oldsmobile in the GM stable.
