I love regular and Honey nut, but to my horror, after I already bought the whole grain, I read that it has hydrgenated oil! I was upset because I had used your cereal because it didn't contain that oil, which is unaturally produced and harmful to humans in many ways, heart disease is only one of them! I wish I could get my $$$$ back, because I'm throwing it out!
