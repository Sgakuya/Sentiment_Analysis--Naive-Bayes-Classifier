My wife used to work for Wachovia (walk-all-ova-ya), so we have a "free" account. Wachovia admits that they will process debits BEFORE deposits. This has caused our account to go into the negative a few times. When I get on the phone with them and ask why my account is in the negative, they say that it is just the way they process the transactions and usually, they will refund the fee's. Recently I used "Billpay" to pay child support. The Child Support agency refused the billpay check stating that it was a personal check. I called the 800 number to find out what Wachovia's policy was on billpay payments. They stated that the funds are "guaranteed" and that there should be no reason that they did not accept the check. I told them who the check was to and they said "You can not use bill pay for Government Agencies". What difference does it make if the agency is government or not. I asked if I could pay my taxes and the rep stumbled saying that yes you could, yet according to the website, they say that court-ordered alimony, tax and government penalties could not be processed. Point is that they don't know their own rules or make them up as they go. Now for the process of getting my money back from whoever has it to make the child support payment.
