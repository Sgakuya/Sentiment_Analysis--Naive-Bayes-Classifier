I don't think it's actually terrible, the strip has integrity (my vote would be that it was Good ), but I'll wait until it gathers more genuine votes and occupies its real place in the cartoon pecking order (i.e. WELL under Far Side and C H) before I revise my vote upward. Congratulations this far to Kirkman and Scott. Yes, they're trying to scam the league table by getting their friends to contribute, but thus far haven't managed to flood the board with fake doggie votes like that lame Raising Duncan joker.
