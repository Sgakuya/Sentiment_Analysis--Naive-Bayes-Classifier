Loved her performance at the Oscars. (Sarcasm) Halle, way to marginalize your white mother. And for those who champion her as a role model for African-Americans, Angela Basset is a better actress on her worst day. Boomerang ? Flintstones ? Face it, she gets paid to look good (Swordfish, anyone?). Her performance in Monster's Ball was one of the most overhyped performances of the past year.
