Philips products are shabby and overpriced. I bought a 27 inch t.v. of theirs and in seven months it went dead. Wal-mart corrected that problem for me, but I also had a high end DVD player made by them, and it wouldn't play the new dvd's, only old ones. I contacted the company and customer service LIED to me on two different occasions and didn't resolve the problem. I turned them in to the Better Business Bureau to no avail. All I can do now is boycott their products and recommend that everyone else do so as well.
