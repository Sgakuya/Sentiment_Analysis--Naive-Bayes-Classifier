Christian Bale is the best actor today!! He's dropdead gorgeous, smart and totally brilliant. He's also a genuinely nice guy. i know that. if you dont know about him, i recommend you watch any of the following films - American Psycho - you'd be surprised how funny blood and gore can be! Velvet Goldmine - truly amazing stuff about the glamrock age! All the Little Animals - cutest movie ive seen in years. i bet you wont recognise the American Psycho guy in this one!! and many many more. to cynics - i got just one advice - do not judge without knowing what you're talking about. Wishes, Shaleen.
