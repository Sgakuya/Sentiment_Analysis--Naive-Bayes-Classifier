 One Hundred Years of Solitude is a book filled with fantasical adventures that border on the line of dreams and reality. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel the sensuality and lustre of Latin America, where beautiful girls disappear and ghosts weep under trees. Marquez is spell-binding. I do have one caution: red it only if you're ready to lose yourself in Marquez world and forget yours completely.
