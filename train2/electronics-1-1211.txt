We don't have a lot of money, but my husband really wanted an iPOD. So I got all of our friends and all of our family to give what they could and we bought him one for his birthday. Two months and one year later the hard drive is dead. He treated that thing like a baby, and apple doesn't care that they gave us a defective product. They just kept saying you had a year, like I waited to fix the problem after the warranty ran out instead of before. We cannot afford to repair it (another $260) or to get another one. It seems to happen to everyone we know, the iPOD breaks between the first and second year. $400 just wasted. Apple is never getting my business again.
