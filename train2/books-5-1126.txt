i love Artemis Fowl precisely because it is nothing like the Harry Potter series (whoever said it's a Potter wannabe should read the books first). it's got kick ass faeries and cool techie details plus a creepy kid anti-hero that is so refreshing from all the cutesy kid characters out there. i read the second book already and read it twice in two days upon getting it. i'm intching to get the third book later today.it's hard to find artemis fowl books in this country so as soon as i find a copy i grab it. if you haven't gotten yourself a copy of this book, you should! i'm an english lit graduate in creative writing and i still like this. so it's not just for kids. (oh, and my friends are all in line to borrow my copy of the second book).
