The worst thing I ever read in print. (and the book is self published by a "publisher" that only has Stanek books). It reads like a high school student's creative writing project - but it goes on for 220 or so pages. There is very little imagination at work here - no descriptions of what the characters and the places. A castle is simply a castle, elves are elves, forests are forests). It is up to the reader to fill in the blanks. None of the characters really stand out and they all sound the same when they talk. And the book has no ending; it is simply just an episode of a bigger story and doesn't stand on its own at all. I suppose Stanek wrote one story and then just broke it into 4 books to make it seem like an epic or to make more money. I would not trust any of the gushing reviews on this site and others. (they all sound alike - I wonder ... who must be writing them? hmmm)
