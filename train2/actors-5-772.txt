Richard Farnsworth started out as a stuntman and then moved on to acting where he starred in THE NATURAL,THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, RESURECTION,THE STRAIGHT STORY, MISERY, LASSIE and many more, but it was his role as Matthew Cuthbert in ANNE OF GREEN GABLES that made me take notice of him. Richard Farnsworth will always be known to me as a GREAT ACTOR.
