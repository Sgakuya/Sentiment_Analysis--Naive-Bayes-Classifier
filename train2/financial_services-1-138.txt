FEES, FEES, FEES, $27 to return checks, $29 to overdraft because they bounce them on a non overdraft account, $1 POS FEE, whatever that is, $4-5 for money orders and cashiers checks, $2 to use another ATM from them and the fee from the other company. I paid $84 to bounce 2 checks because they processed the deposits after withdrawls, thats right they had the money in their hands before bouncing them but did it anyway and refuse to correct the issue.
