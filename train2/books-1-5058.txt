Ayn Rand is a monster, and the thinly veiled totalitarianism she espouses in her novels is hiddeous. Unfortunately, her simplistic plots and one-dimensional characters are easy to relate to, and she's fooled a lot of otherwise sensible people. Read anything about her personal life and her fruitcake ideas (ex: to be a decent human being, one must smoke cigarettes. no joke) to understand what a wacko she is.
