I love this girl! Shes such a wonderful actress, and a breath of fresh air. The only movies shes gonna do between now and 2005 is the 2 Star Wars Sequels because she's studying psychology at Harvard and plans to make that her career, how rare is that in Hollywood? It sucks that the media is so in love with such an untalented overrated bitch like Gwyneth Paltrow they overlook Natalie.
