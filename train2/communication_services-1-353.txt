I have moved out of their coverage area and my phone is virtually useless. I have talked to customer service at length regarding cancellation of my contract, but I am told too bad, it doesn't matter that they can't fulfill their responsibility, they're going to hold me hostage and make me continue paying the monthly bill, or make me pay over $200 in early termination fees.
