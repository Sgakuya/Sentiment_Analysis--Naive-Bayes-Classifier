Duchovny has gotten the most incredibly expressive eyes. Everybody knows that in order to succeed you have to take risks and go for what you believe in and David takes all the risks he can because probably, he doesnt need the money anymore, so, Kudos for him. Even in the bad movies, David Duchovny shows his talent and his ability to make me cry, smile, dream and etc. but, Im looking forward to seeing him in very successful projects that show just how good he is. I loved House of D, one brilliant movie wrote and directed by David, with the beautiful TÃ©a Leoni, his wife and Robin Williams.
