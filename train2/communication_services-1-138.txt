We asked Vonage not to cut off our regular phone service and called back 7xs to ensure that we would have service in our home, and they decided to send an early disconnection to our phone comapny after this. We received their equipment and it does not work, so now we are out of phone service until they can get another device out to us (its Thurs they will ship on Monday and shipping takes 5-7 days). Go figure. Do not change to them they are horrible. If you don't think that is bad, try calling them, the wait is a min of 30 minutes. I have waited on hold for over an hour before. Trust me your service is much better until they get the cracks out of their service.
