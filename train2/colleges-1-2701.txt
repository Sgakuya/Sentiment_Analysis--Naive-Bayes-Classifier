I graduated out of DeVry University (formerly DeVry Institute of Technology). DeVry taught me a lot of technological skills that are at quite a high level. DeVry's problem is in the courses that they offer. Just about every technical curriculum that they offer tend to be only a few necessary classes shy of a true curriculum. I studied, spent about $30000 of student loan money, and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in their Electronics Engineering Technology curriculum, where their representative convinced me that it is the same as an Electrical Engineering from a conventional university like UCLA. To make the long story short, the B. S. degree from DeVry is like a car that is completely build from the inside-out, but without any tires, a steering wheel, and shiny coat of quality paint. I don't think students would complain if DeVry added a few irrelevant classes to their three-year curriculum that four-year colleges offer to make it truly equal to a four-year college curriculum. This way, instead of my being an Electronics Engineering Technologist, I would be an Electrical Engineer. If only companies understood how DeVry graduates are much more educated than the lazy idiots from ITT tech, Bryman college, Westwood college and other wanna be Technical Institutes that are ruining the reputation of Technical Institutes, it would once again be much easier for DeVry graduates to get good quality jobs. Currently, I have been unemployed for about three months straight(about a total of nine months since graduation in 2002). Despite being able to undertake electronics design projects at electronics engineering firms with other engineers, I am forced to apply for technician/troubleshooting positions where electricians and mechanical engineering interns that are impressed by such simple equipment as touch-screen computer systems work.
