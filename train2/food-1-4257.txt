Although a big fan of pringles, from day one, the pizza pringles made me very sick! They were either contaminated by the maker (Proctor Gamble) or the victim of some terrorism. P G. refuses to comment, answer my letter, respond to my E Mail and has not taken calls from my niece who is attorney practicing in New York. Has anyone had a similar experience?
