I think that the University of Phoenix has been a waste of my time. I received six A's and one B during my attendance there, and I'm sure that most people received similar grades. The instructors have several other schools that they teach for and seem to be non-existent, other than when they post assignments and grades. The team experience is often more frustrating than enlightening and I do not believe that they tell you how much you will be using teams when you enroll. The absolute worst part about UoP is their customer service. My academic advisor rarely returned phone calls or e-mails and she never remembered who I was, even if I had talked to her earlier in the week. Forget about help from the financial advisors, unless they are trying to get your money. I have recently enrolled at Strayer University to try their online program. In October Strayer requested my transcripts (which I paid $5.00 for) and to date we still have not received them (12/28/04). The latest blessing from UoP has been that they somehow messed up my G.I. Bill by reporting incorrect attendance dates. My advice - try another school first!!!
