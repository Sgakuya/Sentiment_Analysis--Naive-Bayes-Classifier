I have a 1993 Caravan, with the 3.3 liter engine and the A-604 electronic ultradrive transmission, and an ABS system. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK! I am on my FIFTH transmission, and my SECOND ABS system. When the ABS system failed (two weeks after the dealership told me it was in perfect shape ), it almost dumped my wife, my son and myself out onto a bust road. The tranny was so bad that it would fail to engage in DRIVE, REVERSE, and PARK! Either that, or it would stall the engine out whenever I came to a stop sign. As of 1998, Chrysler had still not fixed the tranny problem, as a friend of mine who had an Intrepid (same engine/tranny) was having the exact same problems. DO NOT BUY ANY CHRYSLER VEHICLE WITH A 3.3 LITER ENGINE! THEY HAVE RELABELED THE A-604 TRANNY TO SOME OTHER NAME. BE WARNED! --Steve
