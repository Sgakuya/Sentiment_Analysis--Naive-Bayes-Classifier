What Orson Welles did for film is amazing. Words almost can't describe it. He was most definitely a genius and way ahead of his time. He knew how to use the camera, how to use lighting, how to use the right actors, how to use the right script and how to blend that into some excellent films. Citizen Kane is still considered by many critics as the best picture ever made. Touch of Evil is considered the best B movie ever on film,B movie or not) it's just a great film, by a director who knew the art of moviemaking.
