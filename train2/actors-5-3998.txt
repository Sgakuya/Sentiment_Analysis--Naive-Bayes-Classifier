I think he is the finest actor working today. He is also beautiful with an extraordinarily expressive face. He does not act , he becomes the character. His voice is rich and musically resonant. He mesmerizes audiences who lose themselves in his interpretation of the character, and in his immersion in the story. Looks, brains, talent, voice, a man who responds to the world's agonies, he is a gift to the world.
