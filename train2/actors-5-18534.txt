I wouldn't call Orson Welles a wasted talent, but he certainly could've been more. He did make quite possibly the greatest movie ever in Citizen Kane, but he was far from prolific, however, despite being one of the most influential filmakers of all-time. His use of spacing (notice how Kane and Sara grow farther apart at the table as time goes on) and angles can be found in every worthwhile movie today. Due to gutless studio owners and asinine industry people, however, his claim to greatest director ever isn't as strong as it could've been.
