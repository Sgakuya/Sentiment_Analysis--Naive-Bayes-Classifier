Their ATMS are not connected to their accounts; a deposit made there is not credited for two business days afterwards, while withdrawls are posted the next business day. ATM receipts are unreliable; a receipt from a deposit made at a CCB ATM, into a CCB account, will show an available balance that doesn't exist, and management will gleefully absorb as much of your money as possible in overdraft fees--which would not be incurred if they considered their ATMs as part of their bank, instead of cleverly disguised night deposits.
