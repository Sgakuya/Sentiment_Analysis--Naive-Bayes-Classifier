I think that Robin Christopher is an amazing actress. I've followed her from All My Children to One Life to Live and even to General Hospital. It's because of her that I got hooked on GH. She does an amzing job and I find that she's not two dimensional at all. She really does a great job in portraying Skye. I especially love her when she has scenes with Ted King. I think that they have amazing chemistry together.
