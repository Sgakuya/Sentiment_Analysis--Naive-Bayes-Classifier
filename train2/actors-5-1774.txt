This man deserves more adulation and praise than he gets. He's been in the business since he was a baby so he can act...yes, really...he can act. Not like some of those idiots who only think they can act and then have the nerve to ask for ridiculous sums of money to star in a film. Chris can also sing, dance, cook, write and kiss;) I would like to see him get at least another Oscar Award and not merely for the prestige: it's one of the highest accolades an actor can receive today. Chris has starred in so many films and works nearly incessantly. He always delivers a great performance and I am rather peeved that his work in such films as At Close Range, Wild Side, The Prophecy (all three of them), Blast from the Past, King of New York and many others has been overlooked by the likes of 'The Academy'. As a man, he has a quiet ambition and is a pleasure to work with. He's not into 'hissy fits' and megalomaniac tantrums. He always has a good word to say about his colleagues. Can you tell I'm a big fan of his? LOLOL!! As a fan, I was impressed to know that he went out of his way in August 2001 to meet a few members of his on-line fan club. He made a point of meeting and chatting to all who attended. Mr. Walken: I luv ya. You are Da Man!
