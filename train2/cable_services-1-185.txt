Had problems from day one, and Dish sure talks a good game but won't back up their product. When you first call you may have to wait a long time for their inept representatives to fumble through diagnostics ... which will inevitably fail to fix the problem... they may tell you that a download will fix the problem. They WILL hang up on you... then you get to call back and wait all over again to tell them it didn't work. YOU have to pay for postage if they give you a bad reciever. YOU have to pay for a technician to come out if their product fails. YOU also get to sit and wait for FIVE hours for a guy who may or may not speak well to show up. You can mail you check in on time... but they may rip it in half upon opening it... then they'll send it back to you asking for payment immediately.. you can call and explain but they'll still want to charge you a late fee. If your service works for you... GREAT .. if you have even a minor problem you will be miserable with their customer service.
