Great Actor. Yes, he became Moses just as Vivian Leigh became Scarlet. I love his great soul. One of the few that has not been consumed by Hollywood. He is such a powerful presence. If you haven't seen Gideon, you should. If is one of the few movies that he has done that I know of later in his life.
