On May 31, 2002, US Bank in Nashville, Tennessee allowed a $61,000 (sixty one thousand dollars) theft from a savings account by a person who has no legal ownership or partnership. A federal government employee for the Veterans Hospital converted this money without the account owners' knowledge or consent. A complaint was filed to the OCC who regulates national banks. The vice president of US Bank gave false statements to this govenment agency in what I believe was an attempt to cover up their gross negligence. The OCC informed that there are no laws protecting the depositors. FDIC insured is only if the bank fails. A lawsuit has been filed in Davidson County Circuit Court and US Bank by and through their attorney's have once again filed false statements. US Bank allowed a $61,000 conversion and then turned their backs on their customers now making them victims of crime. The public should know that your money is not safe in US Bank.
