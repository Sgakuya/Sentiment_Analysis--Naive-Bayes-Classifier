I THINK ANGELINA IS AN AMAZING ACTRESS SHE DID A GREAT JOB IN GONE IN 60 SECONDS,SINCE WATCHING THAT SHE HAS BECOME MY FAVORITE FEMALE ACTRESS,ANOTHER FILM I THOUGHT SHE WAS AMAZING IN WAS THE BONE COLLECTOR.THIS GIRL REALLY CAN ACT!SHE IS ALSO INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL,SHE HAS A RAW ,NATURAL BEAUTY UNLIKE THE STEREO-TYPICAL HOLLYWOOD BABE. IN MY OPINION THIS GIRL IS GOING PLACES!!
