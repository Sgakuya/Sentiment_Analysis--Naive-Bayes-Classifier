bahh...terrible, terrible whisky. Just awful. Nasty hangover, no flavor, no aromatics, no pleasant afterburn...might as well drink gasoline. No wonder people mix it with soda. Even Beam is better. 'Course, I prefer a good single malt (try 30 year old Tan Froight (sp?)) or some of the seriously awesome 'shine you can get in the hills back east...that is, if you know who to talk to. Some of those old guys are true artists. The little purple bag is neat though. (Get it? Neat? Oh well.)
