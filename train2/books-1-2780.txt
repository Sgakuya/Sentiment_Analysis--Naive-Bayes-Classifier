The worst book on Christianity I ever read! Warren's questionable (at best) theology stretched out over fourty grueling days. Warren uses of multiple paraphrase Biblical translations in order to find the one that proves his point. That's unscholarly at best and more likely eisegesis. It's also full of autocitations to his own work. Stick with heavyweights like Tozer, Lewis, and Bonhoeffer for your reading, not this pablum.
