When I think of Francis Ford Coppola, I instantly recall images of 'The Godfather Trilogy'. A brilliant director who could tell two stories at the same time (see 'The Godfather, Part II), Coppola's movies have become a staple in the art of filmmaking in the college classrooms of would-be cinematograhers and movie directors. Granted, not all his films are great, but to judge him any less than the master he is would be unjust as Coppola's movies have withstood the test of time.
