Hepburn was a fantastic actress and woman. She was way ahead of her time with her free thinking and damn the world attitude, as well as being a marvellous actress. She deserves 5 stars alone for being herself and living the life she wanted (i.e. her long-term love affair with Spencer Tracy) in an industry that has always seen women as second-class citizens.
