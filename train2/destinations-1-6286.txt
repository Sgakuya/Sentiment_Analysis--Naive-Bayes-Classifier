Take your pick; North Crapolina, or Norf Cawina! Been here 9 years, glad to be leaving. the people are terribly unfriendly and unwelcoming, the weather is horrible, (that whole perfect medium climate thing is the biggst crock of bull i ever heard) hurricanes, tornadoes, icestorms, severe thunderstorms every day at 2 oclock in the summer, and unbearably hot an humid from may to august. schools are some of the worst in the country, and the teachers are the lowest paid in the lower 48. North Carolina has the highest number of KKK members as well, there was a big meeting of them in downtown raleigh a few months ago. but, of course, the media hushed it up after 2 days and it never made national headlines because for whatever reason, people want to make North Crapolina look good. The only friendly people in all of north carolina are the black people in the country, this is coming from me, the whitest person on earth. Raleigh is no city at all, and there is way to much tension between races, and northern and southern people. I am northern, and i have to actually side with the southern people too, i dont like the trend of northern people moving the south either. And charlotte has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and a lot of traffic. HOW PATHETIC IS IT THAT THEY CALL THEMSELVES THE BIRTHPLACE OF AVIATION, ORVILLE AND WILBUR DIDNT LIVE IN NC, WEREN'T BORN IN NC, AND DIDN'T BUILD THE PLANES IN NC, SAYING THAT FLIGHT WAS BORN IN NC IS LIKE SAYING THAT THE SOUTH WON THE CIVIL WAR BECAUSE THE FINAL BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN THE SOUTH! Like a bumper sticker that i saw in a gass station (which is the place to be in most of north carolina0...... North Carolina Pride: #1 in hogs, #48 in teacher pay!........ And Ralph, why don't you share what you think about NC rather than slam me for spelling errors!
