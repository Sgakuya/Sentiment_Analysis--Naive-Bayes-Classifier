bought a SF - July 2002, 6 trips so far for the fuel gauge problem, brakes slip/fail, calendar has been replaced - still doesn't keep the right date, back door will not open at times, but dealer can't recreate problem, must be in my head. Service dept hates me - I hate them - this car is a real lemon - I realy like the car, but the one I have must have been made after they announced no Thanksgiving turkeys....Save your money and your time.
