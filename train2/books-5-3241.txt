I am surprised by the comments left about this book. Angel2 seems to be a bit clueless. To clarify..there are separate stories told in the book, the intriguing aspect is that all of these stories are held together by a common thread. All three parts have people and theories in common from the opening section. Angel2 also claims that the one major flaw of this book is lack of explanation ..duh..to quote King himself (through Ted in the first section) Good books are for consideration after... Get it Angel2? King is not going to explain everything for you. If you want to read a book that is going to spell everything out for you, not challenge your thoughts and beliefs..don't bother with King. I will admit, I was a bit confused when I started the second part..downright mad, in fact. Where was Bobby? the Low men? what's going on? Who the heck is this new narrator at the U of Maine? and I was relieved to be meet Carol Gerber again..and before that, I was drawn to the new character and had forgiven King for throwing me that curve. Read the book, you won't be disappointed..unless of course, you want everything spelled out for you. King introduces and builds on already existing theories and ideas that will make you think and consider even after you finish the book. This is not a collection of short stories as you may infer from the other reviews left so far. All are brought together..one more thing for Angel2 .. who changes his personality three times a day and is blind in the afternoon and King never explains why Vietnam..the effects of what he did to Carol Gerber...there you go..now you know why..in the simplest terms. Now if you want to reread the book and consider the effects of the war as well as the spiritual ideas that King illustrates..maybe you can better understand.
