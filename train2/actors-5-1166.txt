Tom Hanks is one of the best actors! He is wonderful! He can do anything when it comes to acting! I love all his movies. He got his start in Bosum Buddies and has went up hill from there. Of course he has had a few of the not so popular movies, but he still stands above most of the actors out in the world today. Good work Tom!!
