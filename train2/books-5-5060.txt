This is a bizarre and hilarious book. Requires a bit of an intellectual reach, so it's well above the Toni Morrison, Harper Lee crowd. Sterne writes from the point of view of a hopeless git, who takes over two hundred pages to get born, and never accomplishes anything. Like Ulysses, this is not an easy read, but it is worth the effort. Very funny. Sternes description (in Shandy's words) of why the hero is only half a man because of his father's habit of winding a clock is roll on the ground stuff.
