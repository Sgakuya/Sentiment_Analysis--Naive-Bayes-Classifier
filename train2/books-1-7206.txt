While the first book is really excellent, it is pretty much all downhill from there. It seems like every books ends in a showdown to save the world from total destruction. Every plot is made up out of thin air, and despite the fact that Richard, the main hero, is supposed to be the most powerful wizard in like 3,000 years he gets into stupid problems that anyone with even half of a brain could have avoided. I would recommend reading the first book, Wizard's First Rule and stopping there. I think, however, that this series could have been promising in another authors hands.
