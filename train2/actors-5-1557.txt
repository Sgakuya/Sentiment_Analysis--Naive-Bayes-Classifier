Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors in history. Lean on Me was an amazing movie. And if y'all haven't seen Along Came a Spider, you have got to see it! Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross could not be more thrilling! Why the heck is he only number five on this list? He should be at least number two! Sometimes, I forget that he's just an actor, unlike those fakey idiots Leonardo DiCaprio and Bruce Willis who can't convince me of anything. I will be first in line to see his next movie, whatever it is! Take care, everyone.
