Joan Bennett had a long and respected film and stage career behind her when she accepted the role that would endear her to myriad Baby Boomers that of Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, matriarch of the wealthy and haunted Collin s family of Collinsport, Maine. She will always have a special place in my heart for her role in Dark Shadows a show that, despite the bloopers, blunders and seemingly primitive special effects (not fair really to compare it to 30 years of technology and today s production values) remains one of my favorite childhood memories. The calm, serious faced Bennett was very well suited to her role as the long-suffering and tormented Liz. She could easily convey a strong feeling of sensitivity, strength, wisdom and determination. Her other portrayals such as 19th century Collins ancestor frivolous and flighty Flora Collins gave her an opportunity to venture to the other end of the personality spectrum giving us a character very far removed from that of the more serious Elizabeth. Bennett represents the best acting has to offer good at what she did without giving you a sense that she was all caught up in herself. From all accounts, she was very well liked, respected and a true professional.
