I have a SONY WEGA 32 and it has a noticable green spot in the upper left hand corner. It was degaussed once and the spot returned. The TV is out of warranty and for the over $1,000.00 I spent 3 yrs ago I thought that perhaps the money was worth it. It was not. As a lawyre I suggest a possible class action as I am sure SONY was aware of the defectives in this unit and similar units. I just purchased a similar sized JVC with the same specs. Love it, advice: DITCH SONY---BUY JVC.
