Stephen Nichols is an amazing actor with a terrific talent that is greatly missed. He creates such wonderful characters with every line spoken. With one look, he can convey a multitude. I think it is this subtlety.....the acting without words that truely makes him one of the most talented actors around! He lets me into each character he becomes. I feel the pain, joy and happiness. He makes that character real. He is Awesome and breath taking! Bravo!
