what the hell is wrong with all you people? she is HOT! although i liked her better before she lost all the weight, but that trend will soon be out of style and she will be back to normal. i think its great to finally see someone so famous and beautiful, that would still be a cool person to hang out with. unless its all just an act, she seems like someone you could actually hang out with on weekends. she seems really cool. any guy that thinks she is ugly is gay. definately gay.
