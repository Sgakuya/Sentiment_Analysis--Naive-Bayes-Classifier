I like Audery Hepburn the first time I saw the film Rome Hoilday.Although what she wore in the film was simple,her beauty impressed me deeply.If a woman become a star just because of her beautiful face,she will be forgotten with the years passing by.But Audery is remebered by the world because she always perfected herself and was serious about her career in her life.I can say she is not a angle on the screen but aslo a angle among us.she was a ambassador of the UN to Africa,Vietnam and other poor areas.she went to those countries to spread hope and happiness ,though she was suffered from cancer at that time.She is a true princess in my heart forever.
