One of those cities that i can't wait to see the condition of after it's economic bubble pops. Which it will. Who would stay there? People should just stay in the cities with personality and wait for the economic cycle to come back around to their advantage, instead of packing up and heading to pathetic dull places like Houston. No diferent at all from plcaes like Atlanta, Charlotte, or Phoenix.
