Anthony Hopkins is the GREATEST...indeed an awesome Actor. Honestly no one can do it like him. His talents stand out in every movie he has ever made. As an Actor, he sells the plot in the movie, bring in the high ratings and reviews and not to mention a HUGE fortune. He makes the BIG difference in whatever role/character- a master on the movie screen. I salute him as the BEST. Anthony is a professional, who truly enjoy his work and thereby allows his gift of talent to be an experience for all.
