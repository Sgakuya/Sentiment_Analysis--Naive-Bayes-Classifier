Ok, no matter the age he looks great! I mean I think he's very talented. A rare movie he played in called Maveric was good I though, he can really act in any kind of movie. He's played the bad guy and the good guy... So he isn't like a Gene Hackman or a Tommy Lee Jones, who ALWAYS seem to play Lawyers. He has a variety. And that's why I like him!
