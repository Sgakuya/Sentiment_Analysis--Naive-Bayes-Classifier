I have to give George Lucas five stars for Star Wars alone. When I was seven years old, that movie was my life. I think Lucas genius really came through in two aspects of the movie: the special effects, of course, which were so far ahead of anything we d seen before, and the story, which hit people deeply because it tapped into powerful mythological archetypes. If you re interested in the mythological aspects of Star Wars, check out a book by Joseph Campbell (with Bill Moyers) called The Power of Myth. Campbell explains how Lucas intentionally created the Star Wars story around universal archetypes like the hero s journey. If you want to dive in even further, check out Campbell s Hero with a Thousand Faces, said to be a direct inspiration for Star Wars. Sure, the new Star Wars: The Phantom Menace movie isn t nearly as ground-breaking or entertaining as the original, but I m hoping the new trilogy will improve as it goes along.
