I can't remember why my wife bought me this book now but after reading it I changed in so many ways (for the better) that I managed to free up extra time for the things that are important to me, get over my fear of flying but more importantly gave me the confidence to get a new job. I can't rate this book enough for everyone - if you think it's not for you then read it and make your decision afterwards!
