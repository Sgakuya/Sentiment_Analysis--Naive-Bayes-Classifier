Marlboro Red cigarettes have always smelled like rotting wood to me, especially the ever nasty Marlboro Lights that are now the number one selling cigarette in the United States. Newport Menthol Box is the 2nd best selling cigarette in America. It used to be that every now and then I would enjoy a Marlboro Red, but lately if I try to smoke one it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I will just stick to my Newports and Kools. They taste so much better anyway.
