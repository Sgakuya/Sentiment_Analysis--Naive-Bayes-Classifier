I loved the book. Of course, Dumbledore's death made me cry like a baby, but the book was incredible. The whole thing with Ginny and Harry being a couple, i loved. I also loved the parts where Ron and Hermione were jealous of each other's couple. I didn't like the fact that Fred and George barely came out in it. They are by far my favorite characters.
