He's one of a kind. When he's not doing movies he's playing hero. He saved once a hiker on top of a mountain and just recently saved a boy who was drowning. Besides he's one of the best actors of all time especially his outstanding performance on Air Force One . In general he's a goodlooking guy. How can someone not like Harrison Ford?
