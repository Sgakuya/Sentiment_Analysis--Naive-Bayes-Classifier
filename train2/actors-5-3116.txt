He's a superb actor and a chameleon - he becomes the character - even physically. He's smart, funny as hell, and just doesn't give a damn what you think about him! He's sex-on-a-stick and he rides a Harley. Oh, and that voice - like sugar coated barbed wire. What more do you need for chissakes?! Russell Crowe RULES!
