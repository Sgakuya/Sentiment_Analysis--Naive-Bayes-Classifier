Hackman is a great actor who in my opinion has never given a bad performance. I haven't seen all of his films, but I've seen most of them, and they were all good performances on his part, even if the films themselves were only average. He was great in Superman as Lex Luther. However, my favorite performances of his include Hoosiers , No Way Out and Absolute Power . He is an actor with a lot of depth and range, and he manages to make his characters believable on screen.
