Not a huge amount of depth but she was certainly an amazing little dancer. Her films tended to all be pretty much the same - I think of them almost as a series...same character, slightly different premise, always a happy ending. I can easily see the appeal during the depression years and think they're still entertaining decent fare for kids today. I can see why she flopped as an adult actress - nobody really wanted her to grow up.
