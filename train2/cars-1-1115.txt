This is the worst car I ever bought! The electrical system sucks, every time I play my stereo it cuts off when I hit the brakes. The little toy battery under the hood is no better. I need more power and I can't change it because it's so damn small. I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this boring little piece of crap!
