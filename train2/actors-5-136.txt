An impressive actor who knew how to read his co-stars in a scene. Bogart is like Spencer Tracy, he's not acting. It's all natural. We'll never forget Bogart as Rick Blaine in Casablanca. Check him out in The Maltese Falcon, High Sierra, The Caine Mutiny, The African Queen, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The Petrified Forrest to see some other great Bogart performances.
