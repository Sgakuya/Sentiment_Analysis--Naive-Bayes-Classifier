Sprint finally frustrated me enough to switch to AT T. Sprint is consistent in taking the approach that unless you ask for the low rate package, they don't give it to you. They were charging me about 500% of what I should have been charged for international long distance calls, because I didn't ask for the low rates. Same thing for domestic long distance. Who has time to constantly wait in Customer Service queues to ask for low rates? Not me. All I ask from my long distance provider is that they have a simple rate structure that's easy to understand. Sprint was not getting it done.
