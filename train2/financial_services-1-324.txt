These people are just bad news. I am sorry I ever got involved with them. They are greedy blood-suckers and will charge you a fee simply for breathing. If you are inexperienced with credit cards, do not try to learn by getting a Capital One card. I wouldn't advise anyone to have a Capital One card, but if you simply must, pay off your balance every month, and even better, use it sparingly or not at all. UPDATE: I see two of my trolls, Curly and Moe didn't find my warning against Capital One helpful. Maybe you guys are employed by Capital One, or are just credit card crazy consumers. Enjoy the high interest and the overlimit fees. Cheerio! UPDATE: I agree with C.C. Ridder. Stay away from Crapital One.
