By far the worst cell provider ever formed. Poor coverage, non existant service teamed up with service centers that can not negotiate price and do not know the individual phone features. When my phone stopped working, it took repeated calls all the way up to the district manager before anyone told me that they had updated their software and my phone needed upgraded software. Not to mention that they are way over-extended on their network. May I suggest carrier pigeons instead.
