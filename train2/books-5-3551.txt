Bailey White's stories of life in south Georgia are full of quirky characters, unforgettable situations, and lots of humor. You read about flying saucers, a bed that transmogrifies into a mirror in the middle of the night (thus discouraging long visits by houseguests), and her adventures as a first grade teacher. Bailey White's unusual view of life and excellent storytelling skills make this a highly enjoyable read. I recommend getting the book on tape, too, so that you can enjoy hearing her wonderful Southern drawl.
