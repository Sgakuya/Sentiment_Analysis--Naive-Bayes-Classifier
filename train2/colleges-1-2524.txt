A very poor school. There is very little to do for fun around the campus, and no where to park long term so there is little point in having a car, you'll have to walk as far to your car as it would take to get anywhere. Some of the teachers are really good, most are not. The fact that the panhandlers aren't on campus property is moot, because the campus is entertwined with the city, so they surround it regardless, including the parks.
