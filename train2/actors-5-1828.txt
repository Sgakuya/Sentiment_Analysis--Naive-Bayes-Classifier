Depp is the greatest actor of his generation, and if he continues to choose diverse roles, he could very well be the best actor of any generation. Proof of his greatness comes in the uncomprimising manner in which he turns his potentially one dimensional characters as of late into Oscar worthy performances. And even Oscar is late: along with the well deserved nominations for Pirates of the Carribean and Finding Neverland, Depp was seemingly looked over for his roles in Edward Scissorhands, Blow, and, most importantly, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
