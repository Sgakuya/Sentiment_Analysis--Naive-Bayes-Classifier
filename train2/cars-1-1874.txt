1996 v6-- LEMON!! Multiple Recalls, One for the Cooling Fan which came too late . . .Mine already stopped and burned up the electric wiring, causing to spontaneously die. Ford would not fix it. Dash panel lights didn't work most of the time, Tail light blew out when it rained, and a slew of other annoying problems. Terrible factory defective car!
