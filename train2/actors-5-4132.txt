Hoffman is one of those actors where you immediately recognize his voice and his face and say 'my, I've seen him in lots of films...but his name escapes you. A brilliant character actor, he has shined in Patch Adams, Boogie Nights, Cold Mountain and countless others. A favorite of mine is his role as cynical rock critic Lester Bangs in Almost Famous. He is absolutely outstanding and deserves much more respect.
