Awful experience. Always having items added to my account that I do not authorize. When I try to get the items off I still get charged for them. I got charged for AOL on my Bellsouth bill. I called Bellsouth and AOL. Still getting bill. I switch from AT&T long distance to Bellsouth long distance. I wish I never had. My internet bill went up to $600 somehow it was on 919 area code instead of 910. I called Bellsouth and told them that I never had that trouble with AT&T. They told me I was still responsible for the whole thing. The sad part is that they knew my bill is usually never that high. They finally wrote me when it got to $300. When that happen I changed the area code but when the finally bill came in it was still over $600. Sorry I ever switched.
