What a pompous jack-ass....come to think of it, the directors of the same-named movie should have used Moore's pictur to market their film. Perhaps Moore should do a docu-film on Joe Camel in Baghdad.....perhaps he would be able to see why our troops are there. Moore-ons like this person have no idea how fortunate we are to be able to voice our dissention without fear of police intervention. But, along with our liberties does come responsibilities....I guess Moore can't realize that for himself.....what a jack ass....
