They can't seem to unify their wireless system, so everytime I go home I have to have my phone re-programmed for it to be local and not roaming, so then when I go back to school it needs to be re-programmed again. I also just tried their website and anything you click on right now will take you to an error 500 page. I also noticed that if you download a game you have to pay for it monthly. What a rip-off. Even Microsoft doesn't make you continuously pay for their games...yet. I made the mistake of signing on for two years with CellularOne, the reason I switched from my old one, Midwest Wireless, is so my cell phone would be local at college. I should have stuck with them and I'd have saved the money and had better customer service. Whatever you do, avoid Cell One!!! Rip off company with poor customer service, and it's a rarity that the rep in the store actually knows what their talking about.
