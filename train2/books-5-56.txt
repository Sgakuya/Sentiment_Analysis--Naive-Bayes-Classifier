This book was very moving for me. It showed a side not many people thought of. A lot of times it's hard to associate with what happened during this horrible time. This book makes you realize the human side of it. Another book that is good to read similar to this but a more in-depth read of what it was like inside the concentration camp is The Hiding Place by and about Corry ten-Boom. About a Christian woman who tried to help the Jewish people by hiding them in her house and got taken away to a camp. Amazing, the strength of faith and hope.
