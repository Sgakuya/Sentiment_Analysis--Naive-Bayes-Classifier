Language conflicts since the days of Jacques Cartier. Maurice Duplessis and his iron-fisted rule of la belle province. Meech Lake and its pathetic attempt to Band-Aid the Quebec crisis. Socialized medicine. Beautiful country in terms of its scenery, although the Niagara Peninsula tends to be a wee bit overpolluted. You know, toxic wastes and all that sort of stuff. And Nunavut? Don't think so. What's next, a separate homeland for the Metis? Eh? Eh? Eh?
