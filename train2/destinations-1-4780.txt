Was in Flint for a sporting event a few years ago. I think the only businesses I saw were Taco Bells, liquor stores and Dollar stores. The downsizing of the auto industry ( General Motors started here ), has left this town a ghetto, a shell of its' former self. No offense, I am sure there are some very decent pople who live here.
