One of the worst cereals I've ever had. They don't taste like apple or cinnamon, just chemicals. I had high hopes for these, apple and cinnamon is one of my favorite flavourings. Apple Jacks were a major let down and just to make it even worse, they turned mushy as soon as I put the, very tiny, amount of milk I usually use into them.
