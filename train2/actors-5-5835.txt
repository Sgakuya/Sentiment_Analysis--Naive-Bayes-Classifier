Leo is quite a good actor. There are some really stupid people here to say that he is an awful actor since Titanic, that he is only ordinary looking and that his talent is only ordinary too. That is all untrue! He is cute and a great actor. He is also NOT outdated or overrated either. Some people are so stupid it makes me sick.
