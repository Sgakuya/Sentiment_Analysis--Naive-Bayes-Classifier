I love Robert Deniro he is the greateset actor working on this planet. He is so great and I will share my opion why. Well look at The Godfather pt2 his scences were striking and he being true to his acting craft mastered the scillian language. Also the weight gaining for Raging Bull as well as his all to real potrayal of Travis Bickle in the Taxi Driver. What makes this actor so unique is that in one movie he can beat tough as nails(Cape Fear, Goodfellas)and in another movie he can be a wimp(Mad dog and glory) bascially this man can play it all. Definatley the best actor in my book.
