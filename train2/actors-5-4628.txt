I don't care how many people say Jim doesn't know how to act, I think he does. Me, Myself Irene was really cute, and I liked the whole idea of him having to act as two completely different people. Some movies he's been in were *ahem*...alright, and some have been bad. I haven't seen The Cable Guy , but I heard it really sucks. He was actually in a movie a couple of years ago where he played the part of a gay man's brother, and he had to cry in the movie and everything. Anyway, I think he's relly good, and don't really care if he's sometimes chosen the wrong script. Who can resist those facials he makes?!?!?!
