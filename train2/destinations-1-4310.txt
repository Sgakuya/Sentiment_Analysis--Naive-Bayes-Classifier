I use to live in LA (or what I call hell-A) and I couldn't stand the smog, traffic and the people. People here can be very mean and close-minded. Traffic is so f_cking horrible. My friend who lives only 10 miles away from work has to commute in traffic for three hours! CRAZY! Cops (esp. LAPD) are very nazi-like, and probably could be equivalent to communist soldiers. There is just too much crime too as many of you mentioned. Gang shootings, graffiti, roberies, rape...oh..and don't forget the random shootings on the LA freeways....very scary. Thank God I no longer live in this smog-infested hell-hole...and never would want to come back.
