If you've only seen the cheesy movies, trying reading the book. It's like entering a different world and will make you feel warm and Christmas-y...even if you are an anti-Dickens (or anti-Christmas) cynic. It's better than the movie versions--a lot of good stuff gets left out in the films. But the best film version is the old Alastair Simm rendition.
