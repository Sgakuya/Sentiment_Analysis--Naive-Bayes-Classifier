Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. He seems to be so cool and collected, even mysterious. I hope I can meet him in person and shake his hand. He is truly great and a kind person. I can tell this just from his demeaner. I think he probably has the patience of a saint. Thank you, Loretta K Piketon, Ohio
