A piece of crap. Sorry I ever bought one. Great if you like visiting the Jeep dealership and trying to get warranty work done. Then wait for parts. Then wait for them to get around to fixing the vehicle. What? 3 sets of rotors in 15,000 miles? That's normal? Now Jeep won't fix it, they say it's not a defect? What about all the others with the exact same problem? Lemon law here I come..... Never again !!!! Where's the nearest Toyota dealership...????
