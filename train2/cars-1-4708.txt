I loved my '96 S10 Extended cab, 4.3 Vortec with a 342 rear end, 2 WD, I could tow up to 6,000 lbs. Within the past three months I had to have the intake manifold gasket replaced due to the Dextron anti-freeze and and now one of the bearings went and I have to replace the entire engine. I have 64M miles on this truck. I bought it brand new, serviced it regularly, probably will not buy another GM product.
