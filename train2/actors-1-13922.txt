I think she is a terrible actress and needs to stick to trying to act and stay out of politics. Her comment about our President is typical of a Hollywood liberal that would rather see Clinton raise a child with absolutely no morals and be critical of Bush who does have morals raise his two girls. Her snide remark about his daughters drinking because they have him as a father is typical of a democrat tearing down a good decent man with morals rather than a snake like Clinton. I'm sure Julia loves Clinton and all his immoral cronies. Stick to your attempt at acting Julia.
