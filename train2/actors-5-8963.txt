Sandra Bullock is my favourite actress in the world. Why? Because she's just absolutly the best! I mean she's totally kind, generous, talented, loving, beautiful and this list can go on forever. I don't see why some people dislike her, there's no reason at all, but to my opinion, Sandra is a very very talented actress, the way she acts in all her films show nothing but every single spot of her talent and personality.
