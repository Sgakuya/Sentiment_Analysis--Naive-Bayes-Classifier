My absolute favourite actor, he's just brilliant! I've loved every performance I've seen. He is a true master of the acting craft. While I have sat through some bad films just for his (still great) performances, I also admire many of his choices for projects as a whole. All through the 90's (and hopefully into this next century) he has brought out amazing performances one after the other. Most only seem to know him from Silence of the Lambs, while that is a great performance, some of his smaller films I enjoy even more. (Such as Surviving Picasso, Nixon , and August , which he also directed.)
