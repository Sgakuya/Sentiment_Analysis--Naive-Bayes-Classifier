Too much trash on the highways- drive on I 40 from east to west- litter everywhere, and the Interstates are poorly kept- get off the main highways- it becomes worse.Lots of poor habits among the citizenry- overweight, and everyone seems to smoke. Cars propped up on masonary blocks- ugh! Too bible belt for my tastes- 'Praise the Lord' ....'Git those Damn Yankees and Libberals' anyone who thinks there is a 'New South' is whistling Dixie.
