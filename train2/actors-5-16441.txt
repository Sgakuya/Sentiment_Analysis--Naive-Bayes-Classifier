Ingo Rademacher is the Breath Of Fresh Air that Blew into General Hospital as Jasper Jacks in 1996!!I thought he was Then and Still do to this Day as the Best Actor on the Screen.He just continues to Get Better,just Like a Vintage Wine he just Gets Better with age.I think he has proven over and over again that he can play anything they throw at him
