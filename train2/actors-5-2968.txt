Is it the Scottish brogue or what? I don't know. I love to watch and listen to Sean in just about everything that he has done. Of course he IS James Bond, sorry Roger, Timothy and Pierce. When I think of Bond, I think Sean Connery. He doesn't seem to age, he is like fine wine, he improves with time. Great body of work Sean, keep up the great work.
