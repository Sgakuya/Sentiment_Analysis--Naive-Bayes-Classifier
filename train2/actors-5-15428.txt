Chloe Moretz is only 8 years old, but she has appearred in several movies already. She is an incredibly beautiful child with excellent acting ability. She is especially good as "Chelsea" in the new re-make of "The Amityville Horror". It is a dark and complex role, and she plays it wonderfully. And she was only seven when it was filmed. She should have a long and very successful career. Blaine in Seattle.
