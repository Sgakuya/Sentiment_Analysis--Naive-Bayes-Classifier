In my opinion, no one can top Mel. I have been a huge fan since the days of Mad Max, and Mrs. Soffel. I was hooked right away. I have watched Mel evolve from a young pup with a bit of talent, to a man with a soul full of talent. He directs, acts, produces and does a damn fine job in all of the areas. I have seen him in many genres of film from Drama to Comedy, to Action and I can't say that I have ever been disappointed. Albeit, some roles have been better, meatier than others, but who can forget the first Lethal Weapon when Martin decided to help the jumper JUMP! It was one of the best moments in the Lethal Weapon series. As far as I am concerned, there will only be one Mel, everyone else takes a back seat. Keep up the great work Mel, I can't wait to see your controversial new movie.
