As a child, Jodie was known for her frequent roles as no-nonsense, tomboyish girls. One role I don't think fit her was the Becky Thatcher role in the 1973 musical version of Tom Sawyer (with Johnnie Whittaker in the lead role), although she did fine at playing the part. One of her best adult parts was displayed in Nell.
