Wachovia is the bank the creatives had in mind when creating the commercials for Washington Mutual. I'm sure Wachovia does fine if you have hoards of money with them, but their access now checking is a joke. I was actually charged $18 in fees one month for making too many deposits? I closed my account and moved to Washington Mutual that day. I'm wondering if Wachovia will charge me for writing this review!
