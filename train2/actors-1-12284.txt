FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO SAY DO NOT GET ANGRY WITH ME IF MY OPINION IS NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH YOURS BECAUSE EVERYONE LIKES DIFFERENT THINGS AND LOOKS AT LIFE DIFFERENTLY. LET ME JUST SAY THAT I AM NOT A HATER AND I GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DO FOR THOSE WHO LIKE TO LABEL PEOPLE AS A HATER WHEN THEY DO NOT AGREE OR PRAISE AND WORSHIP SOMEONE THE WAY THAT THEY MIGHT. I THINK THAT HALLE BERRY IS VERY PRETTY BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN THE WORLD THAT LOOK JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER I HAVE SEEN THEM. THE MEDIA GAVE HER THAT LABEL FOR BEING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN NOT SAY IS TRUE BECAUSE SOCIETY HAS NOT SEEN EVERY WOMEN IN THE WORLD TO CALL HER THE MOST BEAUTILFUL. THE MEDIA ALSO KNOWS THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS STUPID AND WILL TAKE MOST THINGS THAT IS PROPED UP THROUGH THEM AS THERE OPINION. HALLE BERRY CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT BECAUSE SHE IS A CELEBRITY. AS FAR AS BEING AN ACTRESS SHE IS OK BUT SOCIETY TAKES HER LOOKS AND TRIES TO PROMOTE HER AS A BETTER ACTOR THAN WHAT SHE REALLY IS. BEING PRETTY IS JUST THAT AND ACTUAL ACTING SKILLS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING PRETTY PLEASE GET THAT STRAIGHT. I FEEL THAT SHE IS VERY OVERRATED TO THE POINT THAT SOCIETY TRIES TO PUT HER ON A THRONE LIKE SHE IS GOD. SHE IS NOT GOD AND WE ARE NOT PLACED ON EARTH TO WORSHIP AND PRAISE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE PRETTY OR BEAUTIFUL. THE WILL OF GOD IS FOR US TO PRAISE AND WORSHIP HIM. WHEN IS THE LAST TIME HALLE BERRY WOKE YOU UP IN THE MORNING, PUT FOOD ON YOUR TABLE, BLESSED YOU WITH A JOB. OR BLESSED YOU AT ALL ANSWER:NEVER! THESE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE NO WOMAN OR MAN IS MADE TO BE IDOLIZED THE WAY THEY ARE IDOLIZING HER IT IS A SIN ALONG WITH MANY OTHER THINGS. I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT SUPOSSED TO JUDGE EACH OTHER BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO JUGDE THEN PLEASE BE HONEST AND FAIR. THEN EVEN SADDER SOCIETY PROMOTES HER AS A ROLE MODEL IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.HOW? BLACK WOMEN HAVE BEEN DEPICTED AS PROSITUTES AND WHORES SINCE THE DAY THEY WERE STOLEN FROM AFRICA AND BROUGHT TO AMERICA. SO YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT MONSTERS BALLS IS A MESSAGE FOR A ROLE MODEL TO BE SENDING OUT TO YOUNG BLACK FEMALES JUST BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO WIN AN OSCAR SO BAD. NEEDLESS TO SAY THE FACT THAT SHE TRIED TO COMMIT SUICIDE, SHE LET A MAN PHISICALLY ABUSE HER TO THE POINT WHERE SHE ONLY HAS 20% OF HEARING IN HER LEFT EAR, AND LAST HER HIT BLACK OUT AND RUN INCIDENT. WHITNEY HOUSTON AND MICHEAL JACKSON ARE TWO BLACK PEOPLE THAT HAVE WHAT YOU CALL RAW TALENT BUT SOCIETY TRIES TO USE CHILD MOLESTATION AND DRUGS TO DIS-CREDIT THERE TALENT. HOWEVER, WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO HALLE BERRY SOCIETY TALKS ABOUT IT FOR THE MOMENT THEN TAKES IT AND SWEEPS IT UNDER THE RUG THEN GIVES HER A PAT ON THE BACK AND SHE DOES NOT EVEN HAVE RAW ACTING SKILLS. WE HAVE ALL SEEN MICHEAL AND WHITNEY IN ACTION AND WHEN IT COMES TO SUCCESS HALLE BERRY CAN NOT TOUCH THEM REGARDLESS OF WHAT SOCIETY SAYS THAT'S FACT BABY! I JUST FEEL THAT SOCIETY LUSTS AFTER HER AND TRIES TO PROMOTE HER FOR MOR THAN WHAT SHE REALLY IS. SOCIETY NEEDS TO WAKE BECAUSE THIS WORLD IS GOING TO H--L IN A HAND BASKET
