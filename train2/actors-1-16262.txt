Ridiculously overrated and frequently given too much screen time. His lazy acting style did not merit an emmy win. Maurice, either come to work ready to read your lines without slurring the words together and ready to put some energy into the scenes, or get the hell off of my screen! Or better yet, just go away. I could care less about your character.
