This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I'm a librarian, a bookaholic! I simply was unable to put it down. Wonderful words have come from Canada...MacDonald is a wordsmith extraordinaire. The characters stay in the mind, in the emotions, and we continue to care about them long after the last page. A must, must read...
