I've seen Russell Crowe in three movies thus far (LA Confidential, Gladiator, Proof Of Life), and I was pretty impressed by all of them! He has a persona about him like the actors of the golden age. I was not impressed by Meg Ryan though, morally, she appears to be going through a mid-life crisis, and her acting in Proof of Life, was insipid at best! Perhaps, she needs to stick with the nice girl next door image that she's cultivated, and leave the more complex roles to females with more depth!
