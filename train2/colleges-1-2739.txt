This school is a complete joke (despite the fact that I did very well there). The professors do not care and many are incompetent. For example, Dr.Gene Plunka, who cares little about his students and is totally unfair in his grading. I have friends who had an A in his class for the entire semester and then he would take the final research paper and if the student did poorly completely fail them. Meaning it counting 80% of your grade! Absolutely ridiculous.
