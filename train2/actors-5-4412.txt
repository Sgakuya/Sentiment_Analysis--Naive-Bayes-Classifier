The first time I came to know Jason Isaacs was when I went to see 'The Patriot'. I went back to see the movie 7 times. I think Jason is a very talented and very versatile actor as well as a very handsome one. Not only did he stole the show, he also stole my heart. I hope to see more of his movie very soon.
