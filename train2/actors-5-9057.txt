If Meryl Streep isn't the top actress of the last 20 plus years she is certianly one of the top 2. In her many roles she has proven that she has a range that most performers just dream about. She can believably portray anyone from a working class heroine (Silkwood) to a disturbed victim of Nazi war crimes (Sophie's Choice) to an average woman struggling with her role as a parent(Kramer vs Kramer). Her ability to master dialects is almost supernatural. Even if you may be depressed by some of the subject matter in her movie choices, you can not deny that she was born to act and that she is very, very good at it.
