Beautiful, classy, an upstanding lady, great actress, and so many nice things can be said about her. She is my favorite all-time actress. John Wayne once said she was his favorite leading lady. SHe could hold her own against the rough and tumble cowboys, yet retain a certain feminine charm, even when involved in a fist fight!! Brilliant. And she worth the extra "sixpence"!! And more!!! (You must be a true classic movie lover to understand that last reference!!!)
