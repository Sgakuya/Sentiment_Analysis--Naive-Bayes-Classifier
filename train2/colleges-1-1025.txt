Rich elitist snobs! Princeton admits more than half of their rich legacy applicants (meanwhile the overall acceptance rate is only '10%). It's a bad school for Blacks, Hispanics, gays other minority groups. It's still got the same old boys club mentality that it did when Donald Rumsfeld went there. My cousin got rejected from one of the eating clubs because her family income was less than $200,000.
