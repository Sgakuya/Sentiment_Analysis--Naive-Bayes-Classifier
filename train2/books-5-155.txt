I'm rather shocked that this book received such a low score...I thorougly enjoyed it! In All Creatures Great Small, you'll grow fond of the variety of Darrowby farmers, the Farnon brothers, most important James Herriot, in his young days as a veterinary assistant in Skeldale House. I recommend reading this book, it's accompanying books.
