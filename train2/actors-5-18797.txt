How does he do it? Quentin Tarantino can make a movie that will leave you stumped for a couple of weeks (or more). He is brilliant, period. There is a definite link to my admiration of Quentin Tarantino: I am also a big John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Deniro fan, and each of these actors has been in at least one Quentin Tarantino movie. He truly has a signature to his movies, the out of order scenes and meaningless conversations that are actually clues as to what the whole movie is about...it almost makes too much sense. Not to mention, he always manages to mix some humor in to the brutal scenes. I am so intrigued by Quentin Tarantino, where does he come up with this stuff? What's running through his mind? If he's able to transfer these perplexing concepts on to a movie screen, that is pure talent.
