Whether you like their stuff or not nobody can say that the Coens are bland, formulaic and predictable. IMO, they're the most consistent director/producer team in the biz. They're underrated for sure. Films like 'The Hudsucker Proxy' and 'Miller's crossing' are excellent but are inexplicably overlooked.
