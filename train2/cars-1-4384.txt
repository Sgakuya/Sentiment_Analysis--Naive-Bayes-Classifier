I have a 2000 Windstar with 43000 miles on it. Quite a loud noise when turning. I was told it was tie rods and would have to be replaced. My daughter has a Toyota Van purchased at the same time with more miles and has never had a problem. I am very disappointed in my Windstar and would be hard pressed to purchase another. 43000 miles is too soon to replace tie rods. My next vehicle will be a Toyota.
