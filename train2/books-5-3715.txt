This story has been a favorite of mine pretty much all of my life. I first learned it in the form of the musical. Later I read the story to better understand the plot. The story is very well written. It paints a vivd picture of the struggles of the French revolution from all kinds of people in different living conditions. This story makes me cry every time I encounter it. I have seen the musical several times and have read the book several times as well.
