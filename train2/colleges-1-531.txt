The NYU School of Education is full of drivel. My CONTENT courses in CAS prepared me to stand in front of classroom, not making posters and participating in mindless book groups (ie. Inquiries I and II!). After just two hours of the School of Ed's freshmen orientation, I was filling out internal transfer papers so I could learn my SUBJECT and not worthless psycho-babble. Sorry, but I am a little bitter that my parents and I had to fork over thousands of dollars for the 16 education credits needed for certification. Interested in secondary education? KNOW YOUR CONTENT!!! Your future students will thank you!
