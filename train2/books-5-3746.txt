Unless you are just a flat-out Nazi-soluting racsist, or if you had to read the book for school, how could anyone dislike this book? Taking place in a small Alabama redneck-town, it follows the adventures of a young girl growing up in a world of prejudice during the depression. It definitely has some valuable life lessons to teach everyone. Well-written, well-told plotline, and easy-to-identify-with characters. What more could you ask for in a book?
