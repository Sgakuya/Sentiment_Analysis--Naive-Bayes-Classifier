Leonardo DiCaprio has tremendous potential. His performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape was simply brilliant. While certainly nothing special, his performance in Titanic was satisfying. More recently, he turned in a solid performance in the quirky drama/comedy Catch Me if You Can opposite Tom Hanks. While Leo has made some mistakes in his career (i.e. The Beach), he is a fine actor who when fully committed can outperform all those around him.
