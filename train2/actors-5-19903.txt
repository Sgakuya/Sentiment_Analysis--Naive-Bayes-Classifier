She is a great actress. I really enjoy her on L&O SVU. She seems to be a very level headed young woman. One thing I like about her is the fact that she does not exploit the fact she is Jayne Mansfield's daughter. She is what Jayne could have been if she had not allowed Hollywood to turn her into a stereo-type.
