what can you say about this guy. there arn't enough words. however i like to use the expression awsome i even enjoy watching him in the not so great films he's in. still havn't seen taxi driver yet(if you can believe it) so many roles he has done that i've enjoyed it's to pick an absolute favorite,however, a few that really stick with me are jimmy conway from goodfellas , his preformance in heat and ronin. mr. deniro you are a legend and a humble at that.
