He is one of the few comedians that truly deserve to be called a comic genius. His natural comic talent combined with the hard work, innovative ideas and great lengths he went to for the sake of a laugh are the things that made him great. Some of my favorites are Seven Chances (1925), Go West (1925) and the hurricane scene from Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928).
