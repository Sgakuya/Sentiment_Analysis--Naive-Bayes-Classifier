I have not driven this or riden in it, so I don't know what it is like, but my dad has a bodyshop and had a Santa Fe in there twice, both times it was rear ended. When it came in the second time, the back floor was at close to a 30 degree angle and the insurance company would not pay to fix it because so much had to be done to fix it, so to say the least the guy is now driving aroud with a floor that is not flat.
