When I first saw that she was going to be in The Notebook I was a little unsure of her. I had seen The Hot Chick and the movie was ok, something to watch but nothing special. Now that I have seen her in The Notebook I am a fan! She did a wonderful job, as did the entire cast. If you haven't seen The Notebook yet you need to. It is a movie that will touch everybody's heart.
