I only know Garfield from when Jim used to do the strip.(and want to start collecting the books) He was the most sarcastic, funniest little cat. The relationship with Odie was definately love/pretend to hate and with Jon, it was telling the undiscussed issue of the animals own the owners and the house! Still love Garfield.
