Ayn Rand has taken the ideas, events and people who have established America as a haven for indivdualism and continued to utilize the opportunities that have been established to create a beautiful piece of art. The heroic characters are an inspiration and epitomize the true spirit of freedom. Set in a frightening scenario, the philisophical battlefield of America is marred with one last conflict, with the fate of the individual spirit hanging in the balance. Miss Rand's greatest work.
