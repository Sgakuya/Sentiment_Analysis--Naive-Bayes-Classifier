You all obviously don't know your truck. I bought a 2002 CrewCab brand new, so far its been a reliable vehicle but that's where it stops. The auto-transmission is geared wrong and runs 2800+ RPMS at 65-70 mph, SUCKING GAS. It's great if you put around town, but if you have to travel highway forget it. It's governed to 95 mph. Bet not many of you new that. Don't beleive me, ease up to 95 mph and see if it don't start bucking and choking. They goverened the engine to a max mph of 95. Other than those two irritating points it hauls what I need it to haul.
