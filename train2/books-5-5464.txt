The author has certainly done a wonderful job with character development, enviorment descriptions and the easy going stream of words on every page. The story slowly flows on like waves, some are dissapointing, some spectacular. During the time table of 1977 to 1996 we get to follow (mostly) Vix's journey, her good times and bad, her friendship with Caitlin and her relationships with family, friends, men and her professional life. For the first time time-travelling trough a book, watching the character(s) grow up didn't leave a dissapointing aftertaste. Judy Blume has stayed true to the characters energetic, odd personalities of youth and not made them into something that they're not once they're grown up. Never has a summer place seemed so vivid in my imagination and never have I been kept in such suspence to where a story was going. The only slight dissapointment is the ending, as I really didn't want it to end that way, although it ends in somewhat of a question mark. But all in all... a beautifully told story that will surely make you get all choked up.
