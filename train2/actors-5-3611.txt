One of the best actors I've ever seen. He was the only reson I sat through Robin Hood: Prince of Thives,and I loved him in Die Hard, Sense and Sensibility, and Galaxy Quest. He is a wonderful actor. I will be going to see the HP movies and I look forward to seeing him as Proff. Snape (witch I think he is perfect as). Everything else has been said and I don't like saying the same thing more then once. Although I have already. Oh well. That's all for now.
