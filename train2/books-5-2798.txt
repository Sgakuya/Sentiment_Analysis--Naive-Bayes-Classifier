An important book, riveting if you enjoy reading history. Shirer was a journalist in Germany throughout the thirties, for CBS radio, I think, and was based in London during the war. That experience, together with the prodigious research he did after the war (he was given unique access to captured nazi documents by the U.S. gov't) and his natural storytelling ability, make this book a classic.
