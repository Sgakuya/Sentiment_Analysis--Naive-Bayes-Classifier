Face it folks...all these positive votes are from people that like his looks rather then his acting. Most of his roles are similiar and I can't recall watching a movie of his that I didn't think was boring. Often time there is very little dialogue by him. Perhaps the directors don't want to over tax him. Richard Gere and comedy...don't make me laugh!
