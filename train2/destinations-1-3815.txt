Rochester...the city that roots for Bills football and Syracuse basketball....and makes fun of these cities in the process??? Rochester have the delusion that somehow their city is more white-collar than their neighboring cities...but their Rochester-centric attitude (they are townies) and blandness make me feel like Rochester is praised by people who live there...and no one else.
