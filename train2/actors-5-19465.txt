I am with Wiggum. He is a wonderful actor and I am so suprise that he is rated so low. The character he portrays to perfection, Dr. Frasier Krane has been on the air for many years (dont know exactly how many) He is the star of a show that has won 5 consecutive emmys, no one else can say that. For all of you Kelsey's fans out there check out his website www.kelseylive.com.
