Peanuts deserves ten stars! It has always been a favorite of mine. It is always fun to read and it never ran out of steam during its 50 years of publication. The characters were all fun and seemed like the kids you went to greade school with. To top it off, there was Snoopy, the beagle with the imagination the size of Jupiter. I also love the cartoon specials, especially the Christmas one. Peanuts forever!
