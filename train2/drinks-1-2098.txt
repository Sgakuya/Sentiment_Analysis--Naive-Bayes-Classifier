It is NOT iced tea it is liquid crap in a can ewe!!! What in the world is in it I am afraid to ask but I care about my friends who drink it as they say they don't like it as much as other iced teas but it's all the store has. You've done a grand job getting the product into the stores now IMPROVE the taste so it has NO stcky after taste that overpowers EVERYTHING. I am back to Orange soda while ordering food or going to the store to buy 20 bottles of Nestea My all time favorite since the original lipton product was pulled. My advice to you all is to make another version just like Nestea and sell it cheaper and watch us all drink your sugar water.
