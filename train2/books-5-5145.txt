I feel this is an excellent read that doesnt just get your emotions flowing but makes you think and relate to the character. Its also educational as it brings up serious issues of the past and gives a clear insight into the life of a black women in that period of time. People may argue the representation of men is not fair in this book but infact the character of Harpo portrays a man thinking differently. May be men were just like that. An amazing read, well worth while!
