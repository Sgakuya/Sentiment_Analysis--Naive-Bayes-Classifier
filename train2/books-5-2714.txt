I was always a very thin person, but afte I had my son, I wasn't able to take the weight off. I heard about Body for life, and I decided to read the book and give it a try. I am finishing my first week, and I have followed the program exactly. In just this week's time, I have lost 4 lbs and my clothes are starting to fit a little less snugly! I would highly recommend it to anyone!
