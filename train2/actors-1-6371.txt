Knuckleheaded screen presence who appeals to a knuckleheaded audience. Those Mummy flicks were retarded crap only fit for intelligence-challenged fourthgraders. Encino Man rates as one of the worst films of all time. And it tells you plenty about an actor if he takes screen roles in films based on Saturday morning cartoons.
