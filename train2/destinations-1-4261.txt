I don't know what happened to Dallas. This used to be an OK place to visit. The last couple of times I have visited have been awful. It seems as if it has dried up. The two friends that I had in Dallas have now moved to Atlanta and I don't see any reason to visit. The city has some architecture that I find interesting, if not a bit tacky. There seems to be no energy in the air, giving the city a lonely feel. The clubs feel empty as well and don't have nearly the crowds of Atlanta or New Orleans. It could be the poor state of the economy that has hurt Dallas. The people generally are friendly and good natured here.The hispanic population seems to be rising rapidly and it appears that the city is void of the young and the hip.I have had some good times in this city and hate to feel that it is gone for good. I hope this city gives us all a reason to visit again.
