Being one of the most gorgeous women around, people will always criticize you. Halle is one of the most talented actresses of our day. She has yet to do her best work because of the limited opportunities blacks are given in the movie and television industry. She is also unlike many of these little skeletal white, pogo-stick actresses. She has a real body, and does not starve herself in order to look like everyone else. in fact, many black women wish they could look like her. If I lived on the west side, Halle and I would be married- TRUST ME. Halle is very sincere and will soon be given her golden opportunity to outshine the rest. She is also one of the three best looking women ever. the other two are Toni Braxton and Jennifer Lopez. She is very soft looking and doesn't wear all this bright colored makeup that the skeleton actresses wear. Even when she first wakes up in the morning, she looks absolutely stunning. The only reason why some people don't like Halle is because she has som much going for her, yet she still is down-to-earth and very real. Madd props to Halle! Keep up the good work!
