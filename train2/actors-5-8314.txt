The most captivating actress that ever lived! Just as beautiful as she is talented! I loved her in A Street Car Named Desire and ofcourse Gone With the Wind noone could play the roles like her! I love her she's a goddess and icon. The only actress ever who was beautiful and talented on the highest level altogether!
