It is a great example of Gothic literature. It is also amazing how imaginative Emily Bronte was, considering her childhood. This book really shows how repressed she was and she really releases it in this morbid plot. The character of Heathcliff is who I consider to be one of the most complex characters in literature. He is truly sadistic, yet the reader feels a faint glimmering of sympathy for him.
