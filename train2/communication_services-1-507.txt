Do not believe anything Alltel's service agents tell you! I signed up for a plan over the telephone and was promised a written agreement (which never arrived). My first bill indicated that Alltel had put me on a different plan (more expensive with fewer minutes). After numerous telephone calls to customer service, and after several letters, I finally just paid Alltel in full and cancelled my contract. But now Alltel is trying to extort almost $200 more than I owed (and PAID). They are threatening to tell a collection agency that I owe them $200, even though I paid them IN FULL! Yes, this sounds ridiculous -- and it IS! Bottom line: Do not trust Alltel.
