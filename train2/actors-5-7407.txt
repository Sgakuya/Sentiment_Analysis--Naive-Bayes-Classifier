Great, great comments there southernpatriot and bat out of hell (not to mention wonderful names). It is interesting that you have a problem with actors getting involved in political matters when you glorious conservatives have one of your own, sir heston, heading up the NRA guarding that essential right to bear arms, so when al quaeda returns you can grab your gun and fight them off yourselves. Martin Sheen is a wonderful role model for peace and regard for the sanctity of human life. He is skillfully using his position as a public figure to promote awareness and peace. Those 25% of people who believe that is terrible must have a problem with peace. He would fight to save your life too!!
