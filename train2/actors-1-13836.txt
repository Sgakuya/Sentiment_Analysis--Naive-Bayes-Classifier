Overrated to the hilt. Cannot act, and is very snotty. I never liked her, and still really don't. I will give her credit for Erin Brocovich, which is the only good movie she has starred in to date. But other than that, bleah. Don't recommend her. And come on now, she isn't that pretty. Now her brother, Eric Roberts, that is one sexy guy...:)
