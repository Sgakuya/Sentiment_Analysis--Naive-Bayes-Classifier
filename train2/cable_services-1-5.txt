Rogers cable tv systems is a joke, in one month I had a bunch of movies showing on my bill no one was home to order them nor does anyone have access to do so. I have 2 boxes in my home and they cannot tell which one it came from in their system as they are the only company i know of whos reps programs cant tell that. now i asked to speak to a supervissor and it took 5 days for one to call me back and right away he was rude and kept cutting me off, saying the company has spent millions of dollars perfecting their system and it doesnt make mistakes but yet their data program is unable to show which box the movie showed on. I would hate to see how a customer call to order an event on how the rep determines which box to send it to. The company I find doesnt value customer service as it did take 5 days for someone to call me back as well as not have 2 seconds to shut up themself to let me explaint the situation. btw the suppervissor I had spoken to name was robert.
