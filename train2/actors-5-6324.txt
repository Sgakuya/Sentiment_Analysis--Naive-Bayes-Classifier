The New York Times has accurately described Mr. Schreiber as one of the most gifted and complex actors of his generation. Having seen Liev both on film and stage I know this to be an absolute understatement. How many actors can say a thousand lines with a glance or a shrug? How many actors can recite prose with such fluency that it becomes a part of them? Liev is this actor.
