I loved this book. It was both howlingly funny and filled with fascinating information about Australia. Bryson makes the history of this often overlooked continent come alive, but I really appreciated his obsession with strange disappearances, venomous spiders, man-eating crocodiles, deadly snakes and all the other equally painful and terrifying agents of death down under. There's never a dull moment in the book, and it's almost impossible to put down once begun.
