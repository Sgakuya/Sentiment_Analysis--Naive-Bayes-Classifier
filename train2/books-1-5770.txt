Totally contrived and implausible garbage. I tried reading this crap and gave up on it because the requirements of the suspension of disbelief were so severe. This Chichton has been writing the crappiest best sellers for decades now, which shows you that the American reading public, for the most part, are mongoloids. They'd be better off reading the Yellow Pages than greasy kid stuff like this.
