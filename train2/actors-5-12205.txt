I think shes a very good actress, and one of the sexiest women in film. (since I don't watch TV much except for sports and news and movies I've missed seeing her on talk shows.) Frankly I don't care about her real persona. I didn't care about Monroe's either, and I think they are running in the top 5 sexiest actresses ever. Go ahead, call me a pig, I dare ya.
