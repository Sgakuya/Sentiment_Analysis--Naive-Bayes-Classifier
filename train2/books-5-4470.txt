Of all of the Bronte works I read, Jany Eyre impresses me the most. Wuthering Heights is annoying but Jane has a style all her own. This book speaks of nobility and honor in women, and I have a great deal of respect for that optimism. Having been to Dartmoor, I understand the depression, but it took a great deel more courage to write positively.
