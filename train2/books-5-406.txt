I love these books, especially the lion, the with and the wardrobe. i especially wanted to respond to DeniseNZ in case she visits this site again. Yes, Christian themes are rampant in this book, and all the Narnia books actually. Aslan is an allegory for Jesus. He, like Jesus, sacrifices himself for another (Edmund and mankind, respectively) and is then resurrected. This is the major Christian imagery in the book, but other examples include simple things like Edmund eating the Turkish Delights and the breaking of the stone table. If you would like more information about Christianity and Narnia, just use a search engine--the web has all sorts of great sources about this topic.
