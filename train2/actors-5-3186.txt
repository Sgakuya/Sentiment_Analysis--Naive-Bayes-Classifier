In my opinion, Russell Crowe has no peer in his acting talent. He has more in common with the old masters -- Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando -- than any of his contemporaries. His onscreen presence and power captivates, drawing audience's attention like a super-charged magnet. For many, many years to come, Russell Crowe will be a force to be contended with in the movie business. As a movie lover, I am most grateful for this.
