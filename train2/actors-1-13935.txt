I find Julia Roberts as a good entertainer. But I'm very upset in this year's Oscars, I think (and I'm not alone in this) that she won the Oscar because she IS Julia Roberts, she's Hollywood's sweetheart, the girl who deserves everything. There are many people who derserve the Oscar more than her. This year's Oscar was a huge mistake. She's the same in all of her movies, I don't see why they gave this woman an Oscar, she's not worthy.
