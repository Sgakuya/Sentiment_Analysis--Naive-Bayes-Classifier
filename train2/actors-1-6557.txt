I agree with Darwin on this one; I do think this guy has basically very little real talent, lacks range, and gets his votes mostly due to his visual appeal (which has always been lost on me). I have never enjoyed one single performance I ve seen and think he is one of the most forgettable stars who still has the nerve to pop onto the screen now and then. Gere seems to basically be just another guy who would fight his date for a look in the mirror.
