Delia has been described as 'The Mrs Beeton of our age'. Dependable, reliable, she appears so _ordinary_, yet this simply conceals her genius and commitment to producing the very best home recipes. It's easy to see why she is everyone's favourite family cook - at least in the UK. This book should be on the shelf of every self-respecting cook - on both sides of the Atlantic.
