OUTSTANDING, is an excellent word for Debra Messing. One helluva an actress. This woman is such a comedian, and she doesn't even have to try. She makes me laugh every time I watch Will and Grace. I would love to see her do movies sometime, as I am sure her presence on the big screen would light up everything.
