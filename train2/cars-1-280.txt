It has been in and out of the shop.Warranty is no good.It is a $6000.00 ripoff.It has had four motor rebuilt on it .Every time I got it back it would not even make it through the second tank of gas.I am very disapointed in it.It is sitting on my front porch in boxes.I wish you would have financed it because you would be eating that $6000.00 dollars
