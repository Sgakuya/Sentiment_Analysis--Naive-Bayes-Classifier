 The Fountainhead changed my life when I accidentally discovered it during my college reading days. I am sure not everyone can totally love Ayn Rand's writings and they're the people that are weak at heart and mind. The book had a great impact on me and I still carry the flame it brought me. Ayn Rand's a genius, I, in fact, named my daughter after her. I still have a warning though, if you try to apply her beliefs half-heartedly on yourself, you'll never experience liberty! Most of her books are to be digested well. Still, I say not every thing can be applied to an individual's life.
