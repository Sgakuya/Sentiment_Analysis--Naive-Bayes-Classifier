Sorry, folks... I've known about a dozen people who one of these. They all just seem to love them but constantly have a whole array of mechanical problems, shell out the big bucks, and still claim they're great. Several go ahead and buy another after the previous one just sent them down into a financial vortex of repair hell. The whole Jeep thing with some of these people just amazes me, considering that EVERY one had MANY problems.
