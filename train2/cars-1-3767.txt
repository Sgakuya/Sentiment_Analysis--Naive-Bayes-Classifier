Now this is a Monster vehicle. Hit that starter and listen to the cackle of the 6.5 Litre diesel. Do you want some attention? Drive a Hummer - every male under 20 will be your buddy. How do I know this? My son borrowed one for a week. It snowed like crazey (2-3ft) the lawn was frozen so we drove it around the back forty with no problems - until it got warm and my son took some teeny boopers for a ride and got stuck in a ditch. The Hummer could not handle it. But there is a happy ending to the story, I stayed on the road and pulled him out of the ditch with my 2 wheel drive EXCURSION! Thanks to Ford Motor Co for the std. tow hooks. $112,000 and stuck in a ditch it's ONE STAR BABY! Oh if you buy one get the soft top - it's difficult as hell to see out of it and if you run over too many people your insurance company will hate you.
