Calvin Hobbes is a marvelous confluence of artistry, humor, thoughtfulness, imagination, and zaniness that results in brilliant comic harmony. Few comics of recent memory have been as beautifully drawn or as consistently funny as Calvin Hobbes; none have been nearly as good at being both simultaneously. C H is charming without being sentimental, zany without being silly, and satirical without being pessimistic. Watterson is a worthy beneficiary of Walt Kelly's legacy.
