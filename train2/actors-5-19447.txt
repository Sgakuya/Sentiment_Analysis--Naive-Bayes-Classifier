Kelsey is THE most talented TV actor ever IMO. His character, Frasier Crane, is both hilarious and sexy. I just recently discovered what a jewel the Frasier show is, while watching late-night syndication TV. LOL I never watched it much when it was on NBC.... what an error on my part. It's so ingenious, clever, and witty. And once again, I gotta say that Mr. Grammer is indeed a middle-aged hottie. hehe I wouldn't mind riding his pony for a few hours. : P
