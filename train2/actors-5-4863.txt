It's been two years since someone last rated Christian Bale. Since then, he has been in The Machinist and Batman Begins. He created memorable characters in Empire of the Sun and American Psycho. He has improved his resume even more with his latest movies, showing that he has the range to be any character. He deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his role in The Machinist, where his body was literally skin and bones. Then he beefed up to play Batman in Batman Begins. He is by far the best Batman, and was one of the reasons why Batman Begins is the greatest Batman movie ever made. His next movie The New World looks very good, and I believe he should win an Oscar very soon. He is very underrated.
