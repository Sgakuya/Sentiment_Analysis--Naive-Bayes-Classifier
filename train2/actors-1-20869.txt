I had the misfortune of seeing her last night in an episode of Hope and Faith. (Now this is a show I will never again watch willingly). She's not funny, but she tries very hard to be funny. Maybe I was a little biased against her, because I had already had the misfortune of seeing her in that dreadful morning talk show she co-hosts with Regis Philbin. On that program also she strives to be funny, and only succeeds in being supremely annoying. Supposedly witty remarks are yelled at the top of her lungs, as if to announce, Hey! I said something funny! Did you miss that? I said something really funny! Kelly Ripa exemplifies why I seldom watch TV.
