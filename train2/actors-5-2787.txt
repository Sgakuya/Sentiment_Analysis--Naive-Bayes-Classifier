Kevin Spacey is by far today's best actor. He plays every role with such passion and finesse, that you're completely drawn into that character. Add to this his good looks, intelligence, amazingly smoothe voice, great sense of humor, charming personality and pure sex appeal. What's not to like? The guy has got it all.
