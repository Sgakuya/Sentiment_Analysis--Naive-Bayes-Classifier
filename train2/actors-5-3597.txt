The wide range of characters Alan portrays is amazing. His performances leave you breathless and wanting more. His acting in Rasputin and Michael Collins, has even had my 15 year old watching them more than once. Whether it is comedy(blowdry) or evil villan(Die Hard or Robin Hood)you will want to see more of this man. His eyes are mezmerizing. He can heat up my screen anytime.
