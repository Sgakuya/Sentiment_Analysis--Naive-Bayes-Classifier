My 1995 windstar blew a head gasket at 67000 threw a rod at 68000. Have had no assistance at all with Ford. Their customer service is SERIOUSLY LACKING! I will NEVER buy another Ford product and I am telling others I know not to do the same. We are still pursuing Ford because they KNOW they have a faulty product and just don't care. we are in the process of trying to get rid of this extremely disappointing product!!!!
