Now there's a tedious mindset for you: recovering vast tracts of waterlogged land from the sea over the past four centuries. Legalizing drugs. Tulips and the wooden shoes bit. Yada yada yada. Overcrowded. At least they drive on the right side of the road, unlike the Brits, Irish, Australians, and other nations. But they've got to get those damned bicycles out of the way of my 4 X 4. I keep knocking 'em down all the time. I understand Queen Wilhelmina liked girls and guys. Now that's a bit much for this American.
