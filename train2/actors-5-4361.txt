Michael Douglas has always impressed me in every role that he has undertaken. I've rarely seen acting such as that in Fatal Attraction - it really was intense espescially towards the ending. Moreover, his performance with Demi Moore in Disclosure was also above average, and I actually enjoyed that film more for some reason than I did Fatal Attaction . He was great in his more darker role in A Perfect Murder , and as the sleazy Wall Street businessman in Wall Street . He have a phenominal performance recently in Don't Say a Word - very, very intense acting on his part. He was believable as Andrew Shepard in The American President (one of my favorite films). In the final analysis, Michael Douglas is a very, very talented actor in his own right, although I feel that his career is winding down ans I feel that Don't Say a Word will be his last truly good performance.
