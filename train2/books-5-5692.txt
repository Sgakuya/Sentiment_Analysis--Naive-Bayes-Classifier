An absolutely amazing little book, The Reader tells the story of a bizarre relationship between a female former Nazi prison guard and a young boy. The simplicity of Schlink's writing style makes the impact of this book all the more powerful. The book expertly explores moral, emotional, and sexual confusion, and comes across as painfully sincere.
