I have been out of work for almost a year. I had to take a job in MN and Centennial does not provide service there. I now have to pay $250 x 2 phones, $500 because I had to take a job where Centennial is not. Centennial's response was they can't let the customer have everthing they want. Customer service? I don't think so! Say no to centennial!!!!!!!!!!!
