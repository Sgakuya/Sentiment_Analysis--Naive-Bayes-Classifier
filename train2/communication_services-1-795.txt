Sprint was misleading in their advertisement of where their signal was available. I live in the Western New York area and I orginally lived in a town where the signal was available. I knew I was moving to another town and Sprint assured me there was a digital signal. The reception in the area where I moved to is so bad I usually only pick up a digital roam signal or an analog signal. When I complained, Sprint PCS said it was my problem and their computer showed that my area had coverage. I wanted to get out of my contract early and switch to a provider that had a strong signal in my area. They said I had to pay a 100 dollar cancellation fee even though I can't get their signal in an area they said I would. When I first signed up for the service the brand new phone they gave me died in 2 weeks. They sent a new phone which died as well. They sent me another model, which worked, but I was unable to acess my voicemail. I made a total of 5 different calls to customer service at about an average of 15 minutes waiting and 1/2 hour where the tech tried to figure out the problem. I am still without voicemail. My advice..STAY AWAY FROM SPRINT PCS
