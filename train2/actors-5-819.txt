Only a dense stupid, moronic, idiot would dare to give Rex Harrison less than five stars as an actor and say that was unbelieveable and fake sounding . Obviously some people are really stupid. He was a great actor and never seemed fake in anything he did. He did more than just an acceptable acting job in My Fair Lady. He was great! Obviously the Academy thought so too when he won the best Actor Oscar for his role of Henry Higgins. He made the role his own and was simply wonderful in it. Rex Harrison was a great actor. It's too bad that Hollywood doesn't have very much of that same kind of talent anymore.
