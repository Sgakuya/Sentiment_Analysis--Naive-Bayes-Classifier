A country that I liked when I was younger, but not one that I like as a grownup. Most of the American otakus that are obsessed with Japan are flat-out losers. I took two years of Japanese in college, and was miserable the entire time. Most Japanese shows that are brought to America are heavily Americanized, same for the video games and whatever else. When you view some of these same shows without the Americanized dubbings and edits, you begin to realize it is not the same movie. Japan truly is a strange place, not to mention xenophobic. I'm sorry I took two years of this extremely difficult language, because I don't think I'll ever go to Japan!
