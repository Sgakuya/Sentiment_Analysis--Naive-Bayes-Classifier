Sorry, but this book was terrible. I mean really terrible. It's nauseatingly slow, boring, and has very little in the way of redeeming qualities. I had to read it for AP English this year, and I heard it was a great American novel , but it was kind of pointless. Steinbeck is a strange writer as well. He skips around and frequently ignores correct grammar and punctuation. Because of this, some call him a genius , but I liken it to a 2-year-old scribbling on paper with a crayon and art critics calling him a genius. Steinbeck could have gotten his point (I assume there was one, right?) across in 30 pages if not for the extraneous and insignificant details he put into meaningless events in the book. Unless you are forced to do so, I reccommend that if you see this book, walk past without looking at it, and under no circumstances start reading it. You would save yourself a headache or two. Oh yeah, read The Great Gatsby instead, because it's infinitely better than Grapes .
