I am a huge fan of Eric McCormack.I have enjoyed all of his work to date, anybody who has can play the role of smart successful gay man in a television series i.e Will and Grace and play it very convincingly is an excellent acheivement. The amazing part he is a very happily married straight man with a beautiful wife Janet Holden and an adorable son Finigan. Keep up the good work Eric.
