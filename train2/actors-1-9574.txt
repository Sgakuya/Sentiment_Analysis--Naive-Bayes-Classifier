Let's start with the word SNOB, highly overrated, married to a mummy, thinks-she's-diva-but-really-isn't, etc, etc. She's not even a good actor. Her films' non-successes prove it. Was matched up well when it comes to working with other snobs, with George Clooney. They both believe they're da bomb, but in acuality, they're both big duds.
