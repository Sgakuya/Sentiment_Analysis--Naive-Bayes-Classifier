Academically, Dartmouth is without question one of the premier instiutions in America. However, I've met two Dartmouth grads and although they're bright people, they are the biggest social nimrods I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. I cringe at having to speak with either of these people because it's like talking to an android. I'm sure not all Dartmouth alums are like this but based on the two I know, the only 5-star rating I'd give would be for the category of DORKIEST ALUMNI!
