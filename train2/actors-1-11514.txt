Cher is entitled to her political opinions. However she has used her celebrity status to promote them and now must pay the consequences. It's time to pack your bags and hop on a luxury private jet and head for Cuba, Zimbabwe or some other socialist paradise. I hope you are able to take all your millions with you. I used to enjoy your music, but after watching you shamelessly hijack Sonny's funeral in front of his widow and later make inane political pronouncements during the election, your stock has plummeted to a negative value. It's sad that your career is over, but no one is to blame but you. Goodbye and I hope there are good plastic surgeons wherever you go.
