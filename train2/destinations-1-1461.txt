I simply cannot spew enough contempt for this vile little near-second-world nation. These mealy, whiny, snail-eating, surrender-happy, ungrateful, unhygenic bastards carry themselves with such unearned arrogance that it is enough to turn the stomach. They need to get it through their effeminite little berets that their glory days are WELL in the past and will never return. Here's an update, france...Cowardice, rudeness, back-stabbing, and moral relativism do not make for a good, much less great, nation!!! While I haven't been to the country-side area of france (which I have been told is populated by surprisingly friendly people), Paris is a malodorous cess-pool of human rudeness as are the other tourist areas. While the riviera is admittedly pretty, it is unfortunately crawling with french people who ruin the atmosphere of the area. Overall, the nation of france is a steaming turd unworthy of sharing a waterway with England. America should have let the Germans keep it.
