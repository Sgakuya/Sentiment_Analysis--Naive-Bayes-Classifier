Milwaukee honestly is one of the worst places to live in the US. Number one, it's in Wisconsin, the state that's known for CHEESE and BEER and is probably the fattest state in the whole country. It's segregated as hell and all the white people use the N-word on a regular basis. The racism there is worse than in the south, believe me I know. I've lived in the south and Milwaukee. Not too much to do for minorities. If you want to move to Wisconsin your best bet would be Madison. Madison was voted the best place to live in the US. If you want to move to the midwest then you are better off moving to Chicago, Il. Milwaukee does not have my vote. It really does suck.
