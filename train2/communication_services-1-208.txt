verizon is the worst.... you get 10 different answers for 1 question... they always pass the buck to another person... they dont take responisablity for the lies they tell..... once my contract is up i will never do business with them again..... i tell everyone i see....even strangers how shady they work...... i had ameritec for 5 yrs.... then i thought i was up grading my service..... wrong.... never again....
