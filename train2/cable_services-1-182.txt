I scheduled dish network to come to my house, and hook up their service. Well, they never showed up! So I rescheduled the service again. They never showed up a second time. When I called them to see why they wouldn't take responsibility. Saying that they use subcontractors. Well, they forgot to mention that theses subcontractors are representing dish network. When I explained that I had taken two days off work. They acted like it was my fault for taking the time off! I do not recommend them!
