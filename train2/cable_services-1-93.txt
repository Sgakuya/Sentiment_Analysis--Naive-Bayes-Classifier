Charter sucks in Rochester, MN too! In one month's time my high speed internet has stopped working because the installer gave the wrong MAC address when he installed it. Wouldn't you think that would only happen ONCE!?! Now my DVR is broken, and they're telling me it will be a week before they can send someone out. So no TV for a week, even though I'm paying through the nose for this service.
