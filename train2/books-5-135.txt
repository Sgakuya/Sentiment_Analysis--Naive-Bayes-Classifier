 Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen was spellbinding. The book was so much better than the movie. It was freightening and fascinating. I will compelled to stay with the main character and cheer for her uplift out of depression. The courage that it took for her to rebuild herself and not find a home with the institution will stay with me for a long time. Excellent book.
