Why Tom Hanks? Because he makes us feel every personality he represents in any of his movies. The Green Mile , Forrest Gump , Philadelphia , Saving Private Ryan and other movies in all of them he is perfect! His eyes reflect the situation, the moment...All the Oscars he won are nothing compared to what God gave him: an unmeasurable talent. I am sure Tom will yet present us with many more memorable movies!
