You can't go wrong with Julee Rosso's New Basics Cookbook. It should replace the Joy of Cooking in the modern kitchen. This book would be appreciated by those who are afraid to cook as well as those who are quite accomplished in the kitchen. The recipes are elegant, simple, and always delicious. In my opinion, if you only have one cookbook, this should be it.
