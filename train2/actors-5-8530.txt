Deborah Kerr was one of Hollywood's most versatile actresses. She played serious roles, as well as light, comedic roles, and she was cast against type to play an adultress in From Here to Eternity. She still holds the record for the most nominations without winning an Oscar. Her acting spanned decades, and she was as compelling in television's A Woman of Substance as she had been in her best Hollywood roles years earlier. No Deborah Kerr fan can forget her moving acceptance of an honorary Oscar in the late 1980s. She is retired and lives in Klosters, Switzerland, with her second husband.
