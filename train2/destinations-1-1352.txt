A bunch of peace-mongering, money-laundering, no-nuke pacifistas, in my opinion. Hid gold for the Nazis all through WWII while millions perished. A haven for thieves and moral usurpers, not to mention ridiculously overpriced watches, clocks, chocolates, caffe lattes, and hotel accommodations. Language problems extroardinaire---a perfect example of how NOT to form a country. AMERICA, BAY-BEE!!!!
