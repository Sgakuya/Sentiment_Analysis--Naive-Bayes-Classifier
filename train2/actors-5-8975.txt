Sandra Bullock is the best actress ever. I think she is a talented beautiful girl. She lights up the whole screen when I watch one of her movies! My favorite movies she has done is Love and War, While you were sleeping, and Practicle Magic...There are a lot of them. I just can not name them all. I love her fun acting roles and I can tell she put effort into it and I can tell that she really tries and I thinkk she is the best ever!
