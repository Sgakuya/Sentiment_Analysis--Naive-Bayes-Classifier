I caused and accident involving two cars of course I wanted to resolve it as quickly as possible. The claims reps for State Farm were borderline mean not understanding at all they made me feel like dirt. The other driver's insurance was very nice and understood that this had been a tramatic experience for me too and were very nice. State farm seems like a cut throat company who is only nice when then are taking your money. This company advertises that it is looking out for people but the way they treated me and made me felt speaks volumes about the company's true nature.
