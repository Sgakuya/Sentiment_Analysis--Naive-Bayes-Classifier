The WOMAN was NOMINATED for an EMMY in 2003. She is sublime! Given some of the comments, I'm not sure people are watching what I'm watching. ALW has OWNED the character of Courtney Morgan . . . she has humanized the character, though showing subtle signs of strenth and devotion. She has made a hitman an endearing part of the GH landscape.
