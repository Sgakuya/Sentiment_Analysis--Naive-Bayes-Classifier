A truly amazing actor who can handle any role and be totally different each time. He has had some great film roles (Truly Madly Deeply, Rasputin) and some that have not been so good, but in each film his talent always shines through. Perhaps best of all though is his presence and energy on stage, and kindness and charm in person.
