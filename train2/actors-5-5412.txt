Rob Lowe is amazing. He's been around since the 80's, but he still shines. His first performance in THe Outsiders was incredible, even though he only had a small role, and then, in Class, he got to be the lead. Through the years, he has played many different types of roles, but he's still Rob. Amazing, hott, talented...just Rob.
