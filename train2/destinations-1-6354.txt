Just took a drive through Tennessee. It's definitely one of the ruder southern states. I was at this Hardee's, and I got the feeling outsiders weren't wanted. The lady at the counter was all partial to her blue-collar regulars, but for us colored Northerners, it was all "order and move-on" crap. This was in Powell btw. Georgia and Kentucky are much better than this state...and that's not saying much.
