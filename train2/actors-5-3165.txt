Russell Crowe is pure acting power, he does the work and does it with total dedication and excellence. Gladiator was so entertaining and emotionally gratifying to watch. With that film you have action, bold character development, just the whole essence of life so magnificently acted by Russell, he just draws you right in, just like LA Confidential, and the futuristic Virtuosity .
