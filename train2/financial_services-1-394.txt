I, too, was an 'acquired customer' when Q&R bought my broker, and immediately jacked up transfer-out fees and trade commissions. Now there's a $25 quarterly fee? I've not even been informed! I'll be following the lead of these others and transfering out - and then I'll be looking to sell short on Q&R, because scamming clients only boosts profits while you have clients.
