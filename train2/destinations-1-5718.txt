A view from a South Florida resident-->>>> South Florida is a tough place to make a living for the average working folk; jobs don't pay proportionally to the cost of living which is becoming very very expensive here; median house price is over $400K; job market is hot and unemployment is low but on average they are low paying jobs; due to the high cost of living, companies are finding it hard to recruit people here; (beach and warm weather isn't much good if you can't afford a house); spotty job market that reigns high in service work but little else; companies who want people to move here but won't offer a competitive wage or relocate you, often toss your resume in the trash because they are not willng to accept locals who don't meet their criteria 100%; overcrowded schools and poor teachers wages = bad idea to move here with kids if you want a quality education; traffic is really getting bad, I-95 is a parking lot and constant construction is a daily event; overdevelopment is pushing what's left of common areas to the brink of extinction; crime is on the rise due to poverty and lack of good jobs and a poor education system; insurance rates are going through the roof due to 4 Hurricanes in the past year and a half, auto insurance is insane as well; % of people who don't work here is very inbalanced noting Florida is a retirement state doesn't mean you will see old people, nope expect to see people of a working age say late teens and up hanging out at Barnes if your very wealthy or a trust funder with a big ole wad of cash you will fit in nicely here and you will have no worries other then keeping up with all the competition here because that's the name of the game. Expect stores, restaurants and malls to be crowded on a daily basis all hours of the day, along with finding it hard sometimes to locate items on store shelves (as someone else mentioned) this is due to the high population density and the large disposable income of Baby Boomers who are moving here in boatloads. Gov. Bush and Palm Beach County is preaching "Scripps Research Institute" as the Panacea for Florida on a whole, but red tape and constant indeceiveness is putting that big dream out to the pasture, even if it does come it's too little too late and will not benefit residents unless they have the appropiate degree to get a job there. Yes nice weather but hard to Live and I mean live the American Dream and if I was rich, I wouldn't be saying anything negative but I'm not......
