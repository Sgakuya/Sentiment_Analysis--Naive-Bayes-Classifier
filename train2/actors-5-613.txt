I am a huge die hard fan of James Dean...he was an incredible actor...and had he lived he would of been a great director. This guy had it all looks, attitude, and intelligence. He took no crap from anyone at all in his life...and that is my motto as well...God Bless ya JBD...everyone else is a wannabe you were an original.
