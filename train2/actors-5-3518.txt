I personally think NIcholas Cage is a very good actor. I love all His movies, but in 'Family Man He took my breath away. IT was the way He projected the character and the strong lines and facial expressions in that movie. I felt the Heart of the character. It was awesome! Great for a Christmas season! He is also a truly sexy man! His energy portrayed in His characters is just awestruck! I love watching movies with Nicholas Cage in. I had my own Glimpse , call it fantasy of what it would be if somehow I met Nicholas Cage! Aloha!
