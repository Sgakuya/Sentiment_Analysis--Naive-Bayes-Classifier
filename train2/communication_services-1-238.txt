The customer service with this company is beyond bad! The customer service people are down right hostile. I swear they are a bunch of uneducated morons who have absolutely no care about your problem. I tried to get a problem resolved where they posted a payment to the wrong account. I spoke to SIX different people, all of whom had a major bug up their @$$! It is almost as it they could care less if they lose business. I actually had one person put the phone down on me when i asked for her name. I called back and asked for a supervisor, who was even more hostile and told me if i have a problem, put it in writting, and disconnected my call!
