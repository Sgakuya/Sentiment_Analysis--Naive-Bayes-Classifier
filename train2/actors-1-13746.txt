This woman may be attractive but to rate her a 5 based only on that is ridiculous given all the great leading women currently making movies. She has been in several movies I like but was mostly bit parts. Brotherhood of the Wolf (Le Pacte des loups) which was appreciated more in Europe and around the world than in the US was a very good movie and she did a decent job as Sylvia but the only thing breathtaking about her is the body. Her acting skills are nowhere near the level of at least 100 other women on this list.
