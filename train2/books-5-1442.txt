Hi, I write and draw this strip. Duncan is based on my little Scottish Terrier MacDuff, our cat Brambley, and the characters of Big Daddy and Adelle are based on my wife and myself. You can read the strip on-line at either raisingduncan.com or comics.com... If you haven't seen Raising Duncan, I hope you will check it out and then come back here and vote! Thank you- and enjoy!
