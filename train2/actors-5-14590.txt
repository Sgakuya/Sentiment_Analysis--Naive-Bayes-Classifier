first of all, thanks to stephanie garcia for helping to add ovlivia to the site! you have great taste in responding to requests! i made the suggestion that olivia hussey be added to rate it all for the simplest of reasons......well, actually there are a couple: 1) she is absolutely one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen. just outstanding. 2) this part i'm sure she would appreciate---having watched a lot of movies and tv in my time, there is not ONE other actress that could possibly play both the part of juliet and mary, mother of jesus! name one-i dare you. there just aren't any. i say that and i actually liked claire danes. maybe it's just that she's such a classical type actress. she seems to become the part. of males, denzel does that. even playing richard thomas' wife in the tv movie it , she was wonderful. i could go on and on, but i don't want to bore everyone to death.....oliva, if you read this, i will meet you anywhere, anytime! it's just the way that it is. later.....br
