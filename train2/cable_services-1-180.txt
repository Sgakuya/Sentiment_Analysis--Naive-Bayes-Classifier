Good customer service when minor problems occur. HORRIBLE customer service (the worst I have ever received) when major problems occur. I tried several times to have a dish-mover service call scheduled and Dish Network never followed through. I was never able to speak with someone who was fluent in English. And agents lied concerning service call apointments, speaking to supervisors, and refunds on service. I canceled my dish network service and will NEVER return!
