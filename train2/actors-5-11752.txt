Like her or hate her, but you can't ignore her. She is one of those actresses that comes along very rarely. Something about her is so magnetic and attractive, but at the same time dark and spooky. She makes you feel so many different things - mixed things. I think that people can relate to her and that she is liked by men and women equally because of her domeanor and personality. She is very unique.
