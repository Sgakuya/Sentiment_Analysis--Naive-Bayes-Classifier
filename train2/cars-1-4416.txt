Headgaskets failed at 75,000 mi on my 1995 Windstar. Ford failed to pickup entire repair bill. The 3.8L V-6 engine has a known design defect but Ford refuses to acknowledge this fact. I have owned a Ford continously since 1951 but will never own another. I want my $23,600.00 back on this LEMON, LEMON, LEMON. Ford public relations, are you listening to this?
