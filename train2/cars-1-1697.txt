I have a 2002 Focus ZTS, let me tell you...I have had it 2 years, 6 months after I got it I had to replace the sway bars and ball joints due to dry rot, then the cd player was replaced 3 times before I bought an after factory stereo, then I had to have the fuel pump replaced, then I had to have the alternator replaced, now less than 2 months after replacing my alternator I am replacing my transmission. I could have put a nice down payment on a new car if I added up all of the repair bills.
