Vastly entertaining book. Anne Rice's imagination is at full flower on this, her best book to date. She tells how the vampires came into being, going back thousands of years to spin the tale, and winds up in modern day America for the amazing conclusion. Her problem in the past has been to over-describe certain things, what some people have referred to as flowery . Well, she doesn't do that here. She just tells the story in straightforward details, and it works magnificently.
