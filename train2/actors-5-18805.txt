Alterman is not afraid to take chances; sometimes it works (MASH, The Player, McCabe) and sometimes not (Nashville, Short Cuts). Unlike a lot of art movie directors though, he always pays attention to the writing. Altman is not a fantasist; he usually sticks to realistic situations and dialogue, though he brings out the surreal aspects of everyday life. Many younger directors throw sex and violence into their movie just to impress the critics and stimulate an increasingly jaded and illiterate movie audience. Alterman never sinks to such lows, though he does not shy from being explicit when it is necessary. Alterman is especially good at creating believable characters (though he has the advantage of attracting top-notch actors by his reputation). A first-rate director.
