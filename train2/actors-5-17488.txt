Robin is the best actress to ever hit daytime and she is absolutely stunning. She is so wonderful taht she can make you feel and experience everything that SKye is going through. Robin is so unlike her character but yet she displays Skye so well. Robin also brings this vulnerable you-have-to-love-her aspect to Skye taht I know the writers did not intend to give her. Go Robin. You are the very best.
