ummmm... for all you guys that don't like her I feel you need to OPEN YOUR EYES. There is nothing bad about Nic and she is the most wonderful person ever. From being most beautiful to being the kindest actress and thoughful and independent one.She is so sweet and a loving mother. She is a great entertainer and she is great for all ages to look up to. There is nothing bad about her and she is the best ever. Noone ever needs to dis her because she has been through so much and remained a strong, spriritul person, I say CONGRATS to Nicole for keeping me interested and being my idol
