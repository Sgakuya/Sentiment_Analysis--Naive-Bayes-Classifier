Ok my reply is to JesusFreak10888...talking about acting and singing? Well, I am an actor and I'm actually filming a pilot for a show right now called Retro News and your saying those of us that hate Hil arent out there making a dream come tru? Well, I'll say something, I am and my goal is to team up with Dakota Fanning, Amanda Bynes, and Lindsey Lohan...the 3 girls that actually HAVE talent and make a movie and drop Hil falt on her face. Who is making 7.5 mil on her next movie? ITS LINDSEY LOHAN not Hil further proving who the better actor is here. And plus I have been singing ever since I was 7 and I personally think you should take a good listen to that cd of hers again...I took my friends little sisters copy of that cd and took it to the sound studio I used to take lessons at and I registered it and took out the radio in the songs (the backround music) and listened to her actually singing and ohmigod I really thought it sounded like William Hung! So really if Hil doesnt get singing and acting lessons fast she's going to fall flat on her face cause Amanda, Lindsey, Dakota, and me are going to knock her out of the biz!
