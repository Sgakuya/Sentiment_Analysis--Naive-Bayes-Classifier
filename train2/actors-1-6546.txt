It's no surprise this guy acts like he has a gerbil wedged up his rectum. Appeared in some of the crappiest wastes of film spewed out of Hollywood in the past 20 years: Pretty Woman (please, hand me the air sickness bag), An Officer and A Gentleman (ditto), American Gigolo, (a 2 hour film that had about 15 minutes of plot), etc. That rodent affiliation has rubbed off: as the years pass, this guy looks more and more like a ferret. Was married for awhile, as he was in desparate need of a beard, to one of the ugliest women ever to make a fortune as a fashion model. Will wonders ever cease?
