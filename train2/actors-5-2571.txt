Hell-ooooooo???????? Like why are there so many negative insults towards the wonderful, fatastic and DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS Edward Norton ?!?!?! The Score just blew me away. I've been totally hooked on Ed since the moment I saw him in that movie and am planning to buy all his movies soon as poss!!!!! When he's pointing that gun and acting so mean and tough, he is looking just yummy!!!! And I just wanna give him a big hug etc.... so that he doesn't need to feel so angry!!!! (lol)!
