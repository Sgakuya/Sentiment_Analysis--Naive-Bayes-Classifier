I genuinely respect the hell out of the fact that she generally takes on highly challenging roles(The Crucible, Little Women, Girl Interrupted)...the problem is that she almost never meets the challenge. She seems to've been lost these last 5 or 6 years. The young hip generation x(I hate the term) girl is too old to play that part anymore. She needs to find a way to fit into adult roles better. Being cool just isn't enough anymore. By the way, Bram Stoker's Dracula has to be the worst-cast movie of all-time. Neither Ryder nor Reeves came within 100 miles of a mildly believable accent. It was painful to listen to.
