I monitored by niece's reading of this book, which was a school assignment for her. I was appalled that they foist such crap like this on our children. Even my niece felt the heavy-handed reliance on word play was a bit too much, and she was like 6 years old at the time!!! Very outmoded, old hat nonsense. These kind of books strive for a lowest common denominator, which is a disservice to the majority of children who are subjected to this drivel.
