This is a must read for any woman who has been through the twenty-something singles experience. My book group read this, and it was the best discussion we have ever had. (a lot of wine was consumed that nightm and the next day there were many hungover e-mails sent back and forth in bridget-speak) It is hysterically funny and satisfying at the end. I also recommend the sequel.
