I adore this versatile actress who has given so many memorable performances such as those in REBECCA,SUSPICION a great character study in IVY, a wonderfully comedic performance in THE AFFAIRS OF SUSAN. She was sexy and awesome in BORN TO BE BAD, regal in IVANHOE, a temptress in SERENADE. Her very best performance in my opinion is in LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN. I think she is highly underrated as an actress.
