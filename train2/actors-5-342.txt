Keaton is undoubtedly one of the greatest silent-era clowns who's ever made movies. I loved his underdog roles... he always seemed to play the awkward nerd (in those days, a sissy) who somehow turned out to be the hero, and sometimes even won the leading lady. American Movie Classics used to air a lot of silent movies (some of which starred Keaton) in the middle of the night, and luckily, I was able to catch quite a few of them on tape. I watch them occasionally, and when I do, it's a total blast! Take it from me, a buff of classic films.... Keaton is truly one of the best!!!
