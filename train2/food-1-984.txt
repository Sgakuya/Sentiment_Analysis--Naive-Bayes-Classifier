Something bad, very bad has happened to Cookie Crisp. I remember this being a huge treat as a kid and was thrilled when my kids asked to get it (yes, I am a crappy parent who allows my children to get hyped up on cereal that will allow their teeth to fall out..hey, we have Kix and Cheerios in the cupboard too). Anyway, I was exctited. You know, that kind of loser excitement one gets over a favorite childhood cereal. This was a very big disappointment. I can not even explain the flavor other than it does NOT taste like cookies, it doesn't even taste like food and it has an odd aftertaste. If you loved it as a kid, just leave it at that, don't try it again..Just keep your loving memories of the old Cookie Crisp.
