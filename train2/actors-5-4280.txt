I think highly of John Travolta because he is such a great actor. I've been watching him since his TV days on Welcome Back Kotter and have seen most of his movies. My family jokes with me because John Travolta and I have the exact same birthday, February 18, 1954. I usual comment that we were both probably chatting with each other before we were born about our upcoming lives. I think I chose the wrong one because I'm not as wealthy as Mr. Travolta!
