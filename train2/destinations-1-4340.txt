I like the various restaurants in LA..and that's it. Other than that, LA is just a nuclear wasteland of America. There's dirty smoggy air, heavy traffic and the folks are unfriendly, rude and fake. The locals are also materialistic, and only look at people's appearance. People also drive crazy here as if they want to simply piss the crap out of people. I would NOT recommend people to visit LA..it should be used to test nukes.
