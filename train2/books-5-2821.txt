The book is addictive. Mr. Barzun's style and his lack of pretentision and total objectivity is refreshing. The length (800 pages)at first appears daunting, but as I proceeded, I wished it was longer. My favorite thought is ..the Inquisition is alive and well in Political Correctness..(may not be the exact quote).
