Probably the second most egoistic racistic country in the world, after US! I should know this, since I am a Norwegian myself. We were to interested in our own culture to join the European Union in 1995 we are the only country witch has denied joining EU twice! The racistic Frp , witch UN has used as an example of racism in Europe, has support from each fifth Norwegian! Do NOT travel to this country! :o(
