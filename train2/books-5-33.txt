I loved his first book, and did not think that this one would live up to it. Boy, was I wrong! This was definately the perfect followup to Have a Nice Day , and I think even folks who aren't fans of pro-wrestling will enjoy Foley's unique writing style, his funny and sad stories, and his political opinions. He poured his heart and soul into both of his books, writing them himself (no ghostwriter) on notebook paper! He is a good man, and both of his books are very well written! I just can't wait to see what's next from Mick Foley.
