Elijah Wood...what words can I use to describe his talent and his over all outlook on his fame and fortune? For me there aren't really any! He is the most generous, well- rounded actor that has touched many of the surfaces of his acting career. Although this is true, he still has many years to go, and many ways to grow and expand.All of the work I have seen and reveiwed as a fan has always been excelent. KEEP GOIN' STRONG ELIJAH! (...Although I must firmly discourage any other movies such as Flipper ;) ... it's for the best!)I give him a firm rating of 5 stars!
