Just about the funniest book (I mean laugh out loud funny) I've ever read. However, this is not meant to trivialize the gravity of this books subject matter. Heller manages to portray the world of war in such an insane way it almost seems right-as if that is how it must be. One is then led to question why, in light of this insanity, one would ever engage in war.
