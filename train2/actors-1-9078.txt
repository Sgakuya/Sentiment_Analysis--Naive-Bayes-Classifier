Way too many people are rating her on her looks. If this was a acting competition, she'd lose. (Not entirly, but certainly not in the top 5 lke she is here). She's being judged mainly on her looks, because most every adolescent boy that comes on this site, rats her based on attractivness, which is not knocking them, because she is very beautiful. But, my rating being from a 16 year old girl, I rate her a 1, because I think her acting is terrible.
