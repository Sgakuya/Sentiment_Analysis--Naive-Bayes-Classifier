I had admired Kevin Spacey's acting for years before I saw American Beauty. It took American Beauty for me to notice his limpid dark eyes, his adorable dimples, his quirky, devilish grin, his delicious narrow little fanny. I was blind, but now I see! Ah, Kevin! All of that incredible talent, wit and intelligence wrapped inside such a betwitching package!
