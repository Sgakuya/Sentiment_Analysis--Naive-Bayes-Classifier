The Star Wars films--also written in part by Lucas--are purely brilliant. Sure, Star Wars could never come close to toppling the legacy of the United Federation of Planets, but Lucas's sci-fi series is quite good in it's own right. The Indiana Jones films are excellent action films that mix comedy in flawlessly.
