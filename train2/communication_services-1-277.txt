i can not stand my coverage or plan with bell south mobility and when i have tried to call and ask for help i have had to deal with VERY rude people! my phone will not pick up on the street i live,or near my job. it WILL pick up crystal clear in Rome, New York, Newbern, North Carolina.but how often am i there? not very! the phone does not hold a charge worth a hoot! thank God my contract is up in 2 months. i will NEVER use bell south mobility again!!! i am the only person that i know that still has it and now i see why everybody else switched!!!!
