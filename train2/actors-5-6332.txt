Liev Schreiber is an actor who has the amazing ability to become his characters and not just act them out. He has very a broad range of talent in film and theater. The reason he is still somewhat of a well-kept secret is that he does not draw attention to himself by taking on all of the big Hollywood leading man roles. He is a master of character and subtlety that leaves a far more lasting impression. If you have not seen A Walk on the Moon, run, do not walk, to your nearest video store.
