It is a country of snooty people, but I don't understand the reason. The only 2 universal men they have had were Newton and Shakespeare (whose real origin is still mysterious). The two greatest civilisation of Europe are France and Germany, not certainly Britain. Ridiculous CapAnson when he says that Britain was good to support USA in the war against terror. Naaaaaa. Don't joke and don't look CNN. It is only imperialism. Britain has lost his empire, but USA took over it. The world will be better when AngloSaxon people will be at their home and not to break world's testicle with their mission of civilisation.
