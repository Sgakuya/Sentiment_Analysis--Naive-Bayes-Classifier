I absolutely LOVE Cher. She is a wonderful singer and actress. I just recently saw her Believe Tour. It was wonderful. I would see it again if I had the chance. She is one of those die-hard singers who will be here forever! I know that she is becoming older, but that should not make a difference in her ability to shine! I am content to sit for an afternoon and listen to her CDs or watch her movis. Cher is the greatest!
