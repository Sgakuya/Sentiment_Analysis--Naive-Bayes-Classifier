This book sums up the history of all humankind in a way that is so simple and obvious (at least it seems so after reading it). If you are not familiar with anthropology or ancient history, this is the only book you need to read. All the more era-specific books I have read simply support the theory of this title. It is well written so that even a buffoon would be fascinated by it and yet it still could make an expert on the subject stop and think. Brilliant.
