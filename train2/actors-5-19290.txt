I fell in love with Tom Selleck the first time I waw him on Magnum PI. The show is timeless. I believe Tom is a genuinely fine man and someone who cares about the quality of life of Americans. There is just something magical about his winning smile and good looks. Still sends shivers up my spine after 20 years.
