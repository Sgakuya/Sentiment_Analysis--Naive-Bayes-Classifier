Halle is a great actress. If you're in doubt, you need to see the following movies: Boomerang, Losing Isaiah, the Dorothy Dandridge story, and Queen. She is very beautiful and talented. She is more than just a pretty face. She also helps a lot of special organizations.I admire her in many ways and I know for sure that many other women do too. In reply to fisheyedfool's comment: That was a very stupid comment that you made because she is not a racist, and she does not hate white people. She is half white!!!! It shows how ignorant you are you should of done your hw before you tried to bash on my girl!! You prefer Susan Lucci over Halle? You have to be kidding.
