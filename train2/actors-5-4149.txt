A truly gifted actor with a broad range where he can play everything from Shakespeare to action films. He was magnificent in Othello with diction equal to or even above any of the great British Shakespearian actors. I liked his performance in Othello and hoped he would get the Oscar but feel the studio didn't back him enough and unfortunately I feel a little bit of racism was involved. Of course, Mr. Fishburne has to appear in action films as in order to have a successful career he has to appeal to the masses. He's great and so gifted.
