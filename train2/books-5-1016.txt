Fantastic book and one of my very favorite's as a child. Dahl invents a world of giants with their own nutty, hilarious language and horrible habits of eating human beans in the night...except for one, the Big Friendly Giant (BFG). Quentin Blake's dashed-off illustrations and Dahl's ability to balance the wonderful, the absurd, and the grotesque make this a classic read for both kids and adults.
