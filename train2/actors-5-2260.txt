Mr. Cheadle wins the award for the most underrated actor in Hollywood. His performance and delivery is truly moving and always amazing. Hotel Rawanda haunted me for days afterward. Mr. Cheadle's performance in the movie was inspired and should go down in the book of classics. Mr. Cheadle has the uncanny ability to channel so deeply into a character he no longer is Don Cheadle, he's whatever character he is playing. This man is far too underrated and deserves much more recognition as one of Hollywood's greats.
