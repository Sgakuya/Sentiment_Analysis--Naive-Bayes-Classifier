Lucky Charms is a disgusting cereal. I disliked it intensely even as a kid. What's up with those horrible marshmallow stars, moons, and clovers? They taste like sickly sweet Styrofoam, and the cereal part is no winner either. I've always been suspicious of that leprechaun, too. He seems sinister somehow. Lucky Charms is one kid cereal I didn't mind outgrowing.
