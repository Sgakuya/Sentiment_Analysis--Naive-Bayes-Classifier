Kate Winslet is incredible! Titanic was THE best movie for me but not only because Kate was in it. I've watched all Kate movies. They are all special and amazing! I am not considering Kate as a "star" but she IS famous for a reason! She is talented as you can see in "Eternal Sunshine" for example, or "Holy Smoke", or "Sense and Sensibility", or "Neverland"...etc.
