I have been a DiCaprio fan since his movie This Boy's Life. He is the only actor I know who can carry any picture with his tremendous force of nature and his rare ability to become the character he plays. I feel very priviliged to witness his career one step after the other. I believe in many years from now, he'll have one of the most fabulous filmography any actor could dream of. He's great!
