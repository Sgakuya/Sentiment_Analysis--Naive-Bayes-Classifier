Very Very Very Very Bad. This is an up-start micro brew in Chicago that is famous for it's root beer (which is great!). However, when it came to making beer these people missed the boat big time. I actually spit my first sip out (first time I've ever done that) it was so bad. Flavour wise it tasted like someone mixed champagne and apple cider then added lighter fluid. It was horibly bad, definitly somthing to stay away from.
