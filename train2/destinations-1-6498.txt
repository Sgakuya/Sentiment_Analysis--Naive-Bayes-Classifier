Born/raised in Honolulu, Hawaii so I'd have to give Texas two thumbs down in an instant. "Temporarily" living in Dallas. Integration here is very poor in comparrison to my hometown. Not many Asians and not much to offer in terms of Asian/Pacific cuisine. Houston has more Asians and mixed folks but is more polluted than Dallas and has far more crazy ass drivers. Lived in Amarillo for a while- one of the worst hellholes I've ever layed eyes on. By and far the worst years of my life. The whole region of West Texas (Amarillo, Lubbock, Odessa, Midland, El Paso, and even Wichita Falls) might as well be given back to Mexico considering how horrid it is there. I'd take Florida over TexSUCK anyday!
