Wow! Reading these comments, there seems to be a LOT of jealousy towards the Northern states, New York in particular. It is understandable though... I've lived in a few of the Northern States and Georgia, and Georgia has good reason to be jealous. One of the big reasons for this is the fact that the people in the Northern states are MUCH more friendly and intelligent. (Particularly in the states of Maine, Wisconsin, New York, and Minnesota.) I found Georgia to be crawling with classless and STUPID people. Part of it is just ignorance due to the poor schooling in the area, but it is still no excuse for their loudmouthed, pushy arrogance. Especially considering that, educated or not, a high proportion of the Georgians I've met just do not have much mental potential to begin with. I don't know if inbreeding is really an issue there, but it would explain a lot. Don't bother with this state. Wait another 100 years until Georgia catches up with the 21st century.
