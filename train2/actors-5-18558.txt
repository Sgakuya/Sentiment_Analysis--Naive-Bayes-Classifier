Fargo was a wonderful film. Raising Arizona, great film. However, you can't say enough about that stroke of genius called O Brother Where Art Thou . The Coens brought it all together in this one. Scene after scene blends in seemlessly into a truly landmark piece of film-making. Wonderful writing, acting, and of course the music. That wonderful music. And the period detail was flawless. They deserved the Oscar for that one.
