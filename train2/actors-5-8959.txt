okay here is the scoop.... Sandra Bullock is one of the most beautiful women in the world and not to mention THE most talented actress!!! The only way a person could ever say something bad or degrading about sandra is if they had a big problem and it starts with the GREEN EYED MONSTER you know jealousy!!!How could you possible degrade someone that is talented and beautiful, unless of course you are jealous of them right! To danc2947om- just because she is rated better than you doesn't make her over-rated, okay!To Shelley- I seriously think that you have had a problem with jealousy but hey some peole are born that way, and remember it takes one to know one!!! To nobanabas- yeah YOU, you are probably worse and how do i know? because if you have to degrade someone else to make yourself feel better YOU bite altogether!!!Oh and let me not forget to Maddmarxx- for starters Sandra can act and not to mention probably better than you! 2nd I have all of her movies and i CAN and DO sit through everyone of them!!!! For all you TRASH-TALKERS; Sandra's the poo, just take a big whiff...!!! So all you jerks, kiss my A**!
