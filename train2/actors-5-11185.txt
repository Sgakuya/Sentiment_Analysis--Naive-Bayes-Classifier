Nicole Kidman is my favourite actress now that I have seen her in Moulin Rouge and the Others! she's very talented and it shouldn't matter about her accent, too many actors focus on keeping the accent and forget about the emotion. Nicole is great and I think she definitly DESERVES to win an award for her role as Satine.theres nothing wrong with an Aussie accent! by Sasquia,Melbourne,Australia
