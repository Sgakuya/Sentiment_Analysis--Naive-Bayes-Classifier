This is an outstanding novel, in terms of its style, content, and character description. Puzo really captured the flavor of the Italian-American subculture, even though most of it deals with the darker side of the equation. I read his earlier book after I read The Godfather (and I can't for the life of me remember the title), and there is absolutely no comparison. It's as though the same person didn't write both novels. Anyway, a superb piece of writing in its genre.
