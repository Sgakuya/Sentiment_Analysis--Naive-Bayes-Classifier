I know I'm in the minority on this issue but I just don't like her. Every movie I have ever seen her in sucked and made me want my money as well as the time I wasted back. I don't care if you agree with me or not. I think she's a very overrated actress with no talent and is also painful to watch. I hate Reese Witherspoon and if that's wrong then it'll be a cold day in hell before I'm right.
