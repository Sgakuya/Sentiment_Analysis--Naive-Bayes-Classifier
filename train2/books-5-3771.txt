There's nothing like a good coming of age story that centers around learning lessons in character and non-prejudice -- Lee was masterful in having Scout discover these lessons through two parallel plots (the grim experience of Atticus Finch in the trial, and the discovery of the truth behind the story of Boo Radley). She was also masterful in simply coming up with the names Boo Radley and Atticus Finch!
