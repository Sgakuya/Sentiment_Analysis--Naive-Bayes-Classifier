Tom Hanks is such a good actor. He can go from retarded, to romantic, to saving a private called Ryan. He is such a good actor. Whenever I see his movies I just think man he is a good actor. He was also very good in the green mile. I loved his role of having to get along with Meg Ryan in You Got Mail . I just love him as an actor.
