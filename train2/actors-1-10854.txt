Anyone remember when Uma Thurman first appeared in Baron Von Munchkinhousen. She was hot when she wasnt trying to be a 'great actress' Uma is about as convincing as Tarantino. Its ironic they ended up in a movie together. She should simply not be an actress. She should be an able bodied secretary. Then I would love to spank her.
