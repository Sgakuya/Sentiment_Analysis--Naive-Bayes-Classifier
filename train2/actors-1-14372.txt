Hey, you owe President Bush some flowers and a fruitcake. the address is 1600 Pennsylvannia Ave. You said on CNN that if the Iraqi's were in the streets celebrating the US troops you'd personally deliver said fruitcake flowers to the President. Show some honor and dignity for a change. Never have so many (you the rest of the Hollywood halfwits) done so little with so much! Janeane, you can shut up now and GO AWAY!
