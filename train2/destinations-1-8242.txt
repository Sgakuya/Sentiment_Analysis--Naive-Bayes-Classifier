I wouldn't take one walk in this place. Mormon History is disgusting. Their leader was a mass murderer and rapist of many Indian women. He was also a heavy drunk and beat his own wife. I have nothing against Mormons in general, I just don't think their history is gentle and accepting. Joseph Smith was not a good man. UPDATE: I want everyone to know that I have NOTHING against Mormons at all. It's the teachings of the mormon church I dislike. I have had friends who were Mormon before.
