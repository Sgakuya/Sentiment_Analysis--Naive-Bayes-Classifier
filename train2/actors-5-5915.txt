Again, this a poll for actors...not politics. Penn is an absolutely brilliant actor, director and writer. Harry Crews and Charles Bukowski were good friends with this interesting and talented man. Nothing wrong with having an opinion on government policy...anyone remember freedom of speech? You want great acting, chjeck out Hurly Burly(with Kevin Spacey), I am Sam, Dead Man Walking, etc. Questioning authority is the only true system of checks and balance we have. He sought answers. Everyone should. Turn a blind eye to your government and you will one day awaken without rights. Turn a blind eye to Penn's career and you will miss some excellent movies.
