I admire Viggo's approach to acting so much that I find him to be a very talented actor. He takes every role like it is a piece of him and doesn't play them to stand out or get recognition. He just plays them the way he believes they ought to be played-with dignity and hard work. Obviously he has become most well known for Aragorn in LOTR and in this role, he truly embodies the spirit of Aragorn. I believe his upcoming work in Return of the King will be so good that it will warrant him a Oscar nod.
