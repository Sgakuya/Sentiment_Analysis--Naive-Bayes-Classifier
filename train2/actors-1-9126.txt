I'm confused as to how this actress who has only appeared in a cultish TV show and flops like Honey is at #1. Obviously she's a pretty girl but when it comes to her acting ability, there's not much to say. Lacking depth, she hasn't proved to be anything worth watching. Must be fanatic fans at work again.
