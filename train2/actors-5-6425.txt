joshua jackson has such a friendly and openminded personality that is so easy to relate to.To me, a lot of actors nowdays are fake, but josh is such a true and meaningful guy that grows as time goes on.His maturity shows as he gives time to others and does'nt let his fame go to his head. Josh is someone who really lives up to the name ACTOR!!!!!
