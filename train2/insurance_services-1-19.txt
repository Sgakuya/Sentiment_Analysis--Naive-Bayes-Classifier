I have Toyota collora 2000 and got damanged on my front end bumper and enign hood. CEICO demanded me to use USED parts or aftermarket pars for the replacement. I asked them for writing me a statment that those used/aftermarket parts are as safe as origial factory parts. They declined writing me any statment and even they termiated my rental car insurence while I was discussing my concern with them.
