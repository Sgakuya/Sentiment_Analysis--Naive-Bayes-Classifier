 Pandora is a wonderful book. I gave it a five because like all or most of Anne Rcie's books, it is exceptionally detailed in full color. Pandora is the story of a woman vampire who is both beautiful and powerful but at the same time lonely. I can identify. Pandora leaves you wanting to read more and more of her life and of Anne Rice's books.
