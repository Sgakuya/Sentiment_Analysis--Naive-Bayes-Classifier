I think Billy Bob Thornton is one of the best character actors around (Steve Buscemi is another favorite). I think that you can bank on any movie that either one of these two is in. My particular favorites of Billy Bob Thornton are Man Who Wasn't There , Monsters Ball , and A Simple Plan . He is definitely an actor from the old school of acting. Not too hip about his personal life. Married 5 times (Angelina Jolie, who I'm not too impressed with as far as acting is concerned, is his 5th wife). Didn't do right by Laura Dern, either. Oh, well their private life is private.
