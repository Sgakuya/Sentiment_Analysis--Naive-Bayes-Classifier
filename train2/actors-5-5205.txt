HEATH LEDGER IS SUCH A GOOD ACTOR BECAUSE WHEN HE ACTS HE REALLY FEELS THE PART AND SINCE HE HAS AN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT HE CAN HIDE IT VERY WELL LIKE IN THE PATRIOT! ANOTHER THING THAT MAKES HIM A GOOD ACTOR IS THAT HE CAN LOOK LIKE ANYTHING U WANT HIM TO AND HELL STILL LOOK GOOD WICH I CANNOT SAY ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER ACTORS.
