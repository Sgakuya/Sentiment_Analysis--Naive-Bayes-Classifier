Elijah is (without any doubts) N 1 in my heart and mind. He's soo talented! I loved his performance in every single movie of him's i've watched, even since some of them weren't great. I would give him 6 stars, cause he deserves them. He isn't just like the other actors, he lives his life and acts without thinking about himselve as a star or something. You've got to love this guy!
