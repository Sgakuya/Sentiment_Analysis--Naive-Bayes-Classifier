Leonardo is one of those rare actor that can actually deliver the goods on the screen. His magnetic good looks, his charm, his inside depth on each character is simply mesmorizing! He brings a certain magic like no other actor, its truly a gift and a joy to watch. He is also a very caring human being. So I rate him a 5.
