Al Capp is a controversial figure whose comic strip, though not exactly Nobel Prize material, still makes most contemporary strips appear absolutely pallid by comparison. He was unusual in the comic strip world in that he was both a superior draftsman and a good-to-great idea man. His General Bullmoose sequences in particular are classics. He soured with coming of the sixties, but from about 1940 to 1960 he was deservedly acclaimed as one of America's most talented humorists.
