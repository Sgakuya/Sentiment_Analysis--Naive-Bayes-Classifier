It's too bad someone stuck our great country's name on this cheap, inferior orange cheese. Makes no sense why it is slapped on sandwiches and burgers so much when other cheeses are so much more tasty. I've also heard that Europeans often mock this type of cheese as evidence of the lack of culture in America. How unfortunate.
