a very powerful actor. he has great range that can be seen in the lethal weapon movies, braveheart, and we were soldiers. that speech he gave in we were soldiers before going into battle was one of the most inspirational and believable i have ever experiance on the big screen. he shows his depth and ability in braveheart, an awesome epic he both directed and stared in. truly one of the best actor of our time.
