A classy, versatile actress whom I have enjoyed in REBECCA, SUSPICION, LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN, IVY, THIS ABOVE ALL, THE WOMEN, SEPTEMBER AFFAIR, THE AFFAIRS OF SUSAN and many more. She could play a sweet, timid, shy character as easily and as convincingly as she played a bad girl, a princess, or a wronged-wife.
