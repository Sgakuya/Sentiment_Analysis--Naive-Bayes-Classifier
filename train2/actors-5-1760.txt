Christopher Walken is one-of-a-kind. He can play any kind of character with a ton of charisma, and is always believable. He never limits his capabilities. From evil Brad Whitewood Sr. in At Close Range , to romantic Vanni Corso in A Business Affair , to SNL, He has a rare, contagious charm sense of humor that we need in this world. He loves his fans, and he loves his work. It is very admirable to me that he chooses the roles that he wants, rather than based on how much money it's bound to make. Walken has been in show business since he was a small child, and he's been on Broadway for a number of years. He's pure talent, THE best actor in history, period. Watching the man is an incredibly euphoric experience.
