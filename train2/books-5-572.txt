Man, this is still my favorite book after thirty years of reading. It made a huge impression on me as a kid. So much so that I now have three tattoos from Sendak's glorious pages. WTWTA is a brilliant book that should be a part of every child's survival kit. Flawless. This is the first book I give to my friends and relatives children. Maurice Sendak is a genius.
