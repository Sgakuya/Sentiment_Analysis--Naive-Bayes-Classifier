just an FYI to the person who said too bad she fell into the anorexia trap after circle of friends--she's always been that thin, she GAINED weight for circle of friends (for the role of benny) and then lost it afterwards. i think that says that she's not weight obsessed like the rest of hollywood, can you see gwyneth paltrow putting on thirty pounds to play an overweight role? doubt it.
