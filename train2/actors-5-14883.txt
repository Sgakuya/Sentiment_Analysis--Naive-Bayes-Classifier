I miss Kathie Lee on the morning show. I feel Regis wasn't getting anywhere until Kathie Lee literally dragged the show into it's present high rating. Regis should give her a little credit. The wall of silence with her name since she left the show does not reflect well on Regis. Goodluck Kathie Lee.
