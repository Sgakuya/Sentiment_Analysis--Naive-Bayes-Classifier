A Truly awful book, terribly overated I feel this book is simply sensationalist for the sake of it, which detracts from what could be a very good story, my other main criticism is that i do not think walker develops her characters as well as she could, am i the only one who when reading thirty year old celies letters that still sees a young girl?
