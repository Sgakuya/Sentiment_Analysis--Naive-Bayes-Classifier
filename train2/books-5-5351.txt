John Irving is one of my favorite uthors, and this is one of his best books. First time readers of Irving will enjoy the tale of T.S. Garp and his off-beat mother. The circumstances surrounding the birth of Garp is highly unusual and amusing, to say the least. Garp's entire life is told in a very amusing way, anbd you will not want to put it down, once you get involed with the story. There are certain parts of Irving's life which he has included here, but the book is far from autobiographical. The movie starring Robin Wiliams is highly entertaining, but barely touches the uniqueness of the novel. I highly recomnded this book for first time Irving readers (along with A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY).
