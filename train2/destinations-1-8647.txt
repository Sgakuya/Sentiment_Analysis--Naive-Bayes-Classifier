I agree with alpepper. This is one nasty habit, sure it doesn't have the same harmful effects to others like smoking does (ie: second hand smoke) unless you consider the occasional slip and fall from a "spitting" accident. I know there is that jock appeal of being on a baseball field sputtering your liquids, driving by a pretty girl smiling with brown weeds in your teeth or having a cup of brown liquid swamp water on your desk all sound wonderful, but... they are not. I guess I just don't get it.
