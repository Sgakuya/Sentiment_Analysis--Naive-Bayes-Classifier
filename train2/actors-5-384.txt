I dont know what it is about Robert Mitchum i like so much but I love to see him in films. Theres something creepy, cool, sexual & detatched about him I always like. He's starred in some real classics but the thing i like about him the most is that he dosent always have to be the star of the film, he can play the supporting role & still be effective. When he is the star, he fills the screen w/ a looming & mysterious prescence that always makes you feel something sinister is either lurking below or he really just dosent give a damn. He's great.
