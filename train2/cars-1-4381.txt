Just another 1996 Windstar with head gasket failure at less than 75,000 miles. Ford's response to my concerns was deplorable. I will never buy another Ford vehicle again, and will tell anyone who will listen that Ford sold me a lemon and ignores major defects in its vehicles rather than recalling or fairly addressing the problem.
