I was just going to rate this book until I saw the comment about rent the movie . If you'd rather rent the movie, please don't rate books... different medium, and I've never seen a movie that has been better than the book it was based upon. Hawthorne was one of our great founders of American literature. The Scarlet Letter is a portrait of that time, brilliantly done. If you're bored by this, don't read any Pulitzer prize winners from the last 20 years.
