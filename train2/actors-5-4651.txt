Ok, I think Jim Carrey is the greatest comical genius that ever lived! Every movie that I have seen of his has either been brilliant and oscar worthy or just plain hilarious! I would love to meet Jim Carrey, it is definitely one of my goals in life! I seriously think that he is a great actor, and he will be my favorite for a very long time!
