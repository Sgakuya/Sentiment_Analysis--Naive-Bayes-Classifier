A perennial delight,for children and adults alike.Rightly voted in Britain the finest children's book of all time;splendid adventures,a marvellous feel for the countryside and seasons, and of course utterly magnificent characters(conscientious Mole,amiable Rat,authoritative Badger and the inimitable boastful Toad- The clever men at Oxford know all there is to be knowed.But they none of them know one half as much as intelligent Mr Toad ).My #1 Recommended book.
