When I first tried Red Bull over three years ago in Chicago, I said this is the worst drink I've ever tried. Since then, nothing has been worse. Red Bull tastes just like diesel fuel. If you ask how's that true, here's the answer. I've actually tried diesel fuel before, and this is the only thing worse than diesel fuel. That's the God's honest truth.
