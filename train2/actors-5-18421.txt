Tess of D'urbevilles is a great film. I recommend it to those that like films that pre-dates the 20th century. The film captured the essence of what life was like during that time period. This story is about a young woman through unusual circumstances is shifted from her plight of poverty into the life of the wealthy. But along the way she faces prejudice and abuse. This film is nicely done. The actors and actresses did a great performance and were very convincing!
