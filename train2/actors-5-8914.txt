Sandra is my favorite actress of all time. I first saw her in (While you were Sleeping). I like the fact that her acting is real. She does not act like a fake. She is a down to earth beautiful wonderful person who deserves the biggest award in acting. I think the movie (Speed) put her on the charts to Fame. Goooo Sandra. . .
