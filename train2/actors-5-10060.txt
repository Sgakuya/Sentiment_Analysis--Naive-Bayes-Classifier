Jamie Lee Curtis is another one of the common folk actresses/actors that I find myself drawn to when selecting movies to watch. I also find her commercial spots very entertaining. I first saw her in horror flicks and she has transcended several stereotypes that could have branded her and kept us entertained all the while. Did I mention she rates pretty high on my Babe-O-Meter too? (I like females for the entire package and not outside shell appearance alone)
