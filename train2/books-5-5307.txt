This book is like a Shakespearean tragedy, played backwards. It begins with one of the most horrible, brutal murders you could imagine; and slowly works its way up to peace and tranquility. Personally, I loved it. It captures your empathy like a Venus flytrap. I found myself feeling like every little success was my own. It certainly makes you contemplate your own mortality. As for, cold-hearted, sick, child killer, the book shows real insight into the mind of a killer. Susie never seems enraged at all, and throughout the book you begin to understand how the killer ended up in this way. For once it isn't looking at good and bad as black and white. She pines for life, but doesn't portray death as strictly negative. She is angry at her murderer, but retains an oddly calm and open-minded viewpoint. My main point: it WILL make you think. Whether you hate it or adore it, something in you will be wondering what really happens to us after we breathe our last.
