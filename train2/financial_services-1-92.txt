I made a very small math error in my register, and a check hit my bank the same day as a deposit. The check was for .06 cents more than what was in my account prior to the deposit.....and even though the deposit was made the same day, USBank charge me a $32 overdraft fee! I've run into other problems with them before - and today I'm changing banks!
