These people are far and away the worst bunch of scumbags I've ever come across. I was having trouble getting a payroll check cashed. It had bounced once and I'd retrieved it from my bank so as to avoid fees being charged to me. When US Bank repeatedly refused to cash it and wouldn't tell me if it was because of insufficient funds or because the account had been closed (something else my sleazeball employer had done) they refused. I pointed out that I could call their 800 number and find out if there were funds in the account, they continued to stonewall me. I left the bank angry, but under my own power. This distinction is important because I recieved an email from my boss saying I was terminated because the US Bank branch manager had called to say I had gone postal in his branch. Basically, they didn't like me standing up for my rights, so they vindictivly called my boss to get me fired. I HAD a job paying $62,500 a year. NOW I have no job! There is also no attorney willing to take the case because the bank is likely willing to spend millions to defend the indefensible. Another victory for corporate slime! My suggestion: Not only should you NEVER do business with this bank, don't even WALK INTO one of their branches lest your life be ruined at the whim of one of their employees!
