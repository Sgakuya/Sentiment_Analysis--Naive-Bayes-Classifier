After 8 attempts to repair a noisey front AND rear differential on my 2000 Grand Cherokee - I give up! I love the vehicle but the quality of the transmission and axle assemblies stinks! I even had a Chrysler engineer look at the vehicle - he could improve the noise only marginally. Then they traded me into another like vehicle. Quiet. Then after 6000 miles the noises started again. by 12000 miles it was back to the same level of my first JGC. Never again. Sorry Jeep, its a great looking vehicle - but thats where it ends!
