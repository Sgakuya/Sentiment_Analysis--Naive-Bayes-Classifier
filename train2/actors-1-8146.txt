Unfortunately, many have forgotten and still >> >>countless others have never known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the >>idea >>of our country but specific men who served and sacrificed during >>Vietnam. >> >>The first part of this is from an F-4E pilot. The pilot's name is Jerry >>Driscoll, a River Rat. In 1968, the former Commandant of the USAF >>Survival >>School was a POW in Ho Lo Prison-the Hanoi Hilton. Dragged from a >>stinking >>cesspit of a cell, cleaned, fed, and dressed in clean PJ's, he was >>ordered >>to describe for a visiting American Peace Activist the lenient and >>humane >>treatment he'd received. He spat at Ms. Fonda, was clubbed, and >>dragged >>away. >> >>During the subsequent beating, he fell forward upon the camp >>Commandant's >>feet, which sent that officer berserk. In '78, the AF Col. still >>suffered >>from double vision (which permanently ended his flying days) from the >>Vietnamese Col.'s frenzied application of a wooden baton. From 1963-65, >>Col. >>Larry Carrigan was in the 47FW/DO (F-4E's). He spent 6 years in the >>Hilton- the first three of which he was missing in action. His wife >> >>lived on faith that he was still alive. His group, too, got the >>cleaned, >>fed, clothed routine in preparation for a peace delegation visit. >> >>They, however, had time and devised a plan to get word to the world that >> >>they still survived. Each man secreted a tiny piece of paper, with his >>SSN >>on it, in the palm of his hand. When paraded before Ms. Fonda and a >>cameraman, she walked the line, shaking each man's hand and asking >>little >>encouraging snippets like: Aren't you sorry you bombed babies? and >>Are >>you grateful for the humane treatment from your benevolent captors? >>Believing this HAD to be an act, they each palmed her their sliver of >>paper. >> >>She took them all without missing a beat. >>At the end of the line and once the camera stopped rolling, to the >>shocked >>disbelief of the POWs, she turned to the officer in charge and handed >>him >>the little pile of papers. Three men died from the subsequent beatings. >>Col. >>Carrigan was almost number four but he survived, which is the only >>reason we >>know about her actions that day. >> >>I was a civilian economic development advisor in Vietnam, and was >>captured >>by the North Vietnamese communists in South Vietnam in 1968, and held >>for >>over 5 years. I spent 27 months in solitary confinement, one year in a >>cage >>in Cambodia, and one year in a black box in Hanoi. My North >>Vietnamese >>captors deliberately poisoned and murdered a female missionary, a nurse >>in a >>leprosarium in Ban me Thuot, South Vietnam, whom I buried in the jungle >>near >>the Cambodian border. >> >>At one time, I was weighing approximately 90 lbs. (My normal weight is >>170 >>lbs.) We were Jane Fonda's war criminals. >> >>When Jane Fonda was in Hanoi, I was asked by the camp communist >>political >>officer if I would be willing to meet with Jane Fonda. I said yes, for >>I >>would like to tell her about the real treatment we POWs received >>different >>from the treatment purported by the North Vietnamese, and parroted by >>Jane >>Fonda, as humane and lenient. Because of this, >>I spent three days on a rocky floor on my knees with outstretched arms >>with >>a large amount of steel placed on my hands, and beaten with a bamboo >>cane >>till my arms dipped. >> >>I had the opportunity to meet with Jane Fonda for a couple of hours >>after I >>was released. I asked her if she would be willing to debate me on TV. >>She >>did not answer me. >> >>This does not exemplify someone who should be honored as part of 100 >>Years >>of Great Women. Lest we forget... 100 years of great women should >>never >>include a traitor whose hands are covered with the blood of so many >>patriots. There are few things I have strong visceral reactions to, but >> >>Hanoi Jane's participation in blatant treason, is one of them. >> >>Please take the time to forward to as many people as you possibly can. >>It >>will eventually end up on her computer and she needs to know that we >>will >>never forget. >> >>RONALD D.
