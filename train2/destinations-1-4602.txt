Ann Arbor is a horrible place for normal people. If you are down-to-earth, friendly and have common sense, you will hate this place. It was so far-left liberal it made me sick and turned me Republican for a few years. Don't worry, I'm a Democrat again, but very centrist at that. The people are horrible; they brag at the bus stops, in the bus, either to each other but most likely their cellphone. Many are self-absorbed in their own little egomaniacal, pseudo-intellectual world. Most of the people there have to be super-rich and sheltered, because there's no way anyone who lives in the real world can talk and act like they do. A lot of people give you the evil eye for doing nice things like opening doors. Many times, you will get the cold shoulder or a look away if you see someone you know and want to say hi. You catch on real fast and soon your daily routine becomes really impersonal and robotic. Partying with people here is sad, nobody is really that friendly and it all seems to be a waste of your time. There really isn't much here that's fun to do or different from anywhere else, unless you're into all sorts of alternative, weirdo scenes. You're better off not coming here, and if you do, you better get a circle of friends you identify with and keep them, otherwise it's going to be real lonely. This is a town for the mentally-ill and sheltered rich; stay the hell away!
