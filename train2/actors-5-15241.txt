Henry Thomas is a great actor, but unfortunately doesn't land the roles in blockbuster hits (except for Gangs of New York). Every role he play is so good. Avery in Suicide Kings - awesome! Samuel in Legends of the Fall - what a dream. Simon in I Capture the Castle - a romantic. He is just so good at what Hollywood gives him, I just wish Hollywood would give him more!!
