A depressing dump: for the most part, in the clutches of massive agribusinesses that don't give a flying crap about anything but their own profitibility, and populated by old, poor people living in tiny, insignificant jerkwater towns that are culturally, economically and socially deprived. A state of underproducing slackers highly dependent on handouts from the federal government that are largely funded by hardworking wage earners in the Northeast and on the West Coast. There has been a severe depopulation of Nebraska, and the so-called Great Plains in general over the past few decades, and no wonder: there's virtually nothing out there to hold onto the young people, who bolt out of there for more opportunities and a better life elsewhere. Any region or area that places so much emphasis on college football, a most trivial and inconsequential pasttime, is a location to be avoided: get some culture, or something more worthwhile to do, folks!!!
