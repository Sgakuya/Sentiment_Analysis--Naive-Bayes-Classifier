I really enjoyed Natalie's talent on the screen. Her last couple movies might have been chick flicks, but she still manages to capture the right audience. I feel bad now since she may not be an actress forever, but we all have to follow our dreams. She has given me inspiration to follow my goals. There aren't that many women out there like her which is a shame. Society would be a lot better off with women like her. I hope she graduates from university successfully, and lives a normal, happy life.
