Katherine is a very talented actress. She did a great job portraying Jake on Young Americans. For this role she had to play a teen age girl who was disguised as a boy. She was able to play both parts so believably and created a great fan base for the show and herself. She is a very versatile and charming actress as well as a beautiful young woman. She also seems to be a very real and down to earth person. I look forward to seeing her in other roles.
