Bank of America sold my information to third party retailers!!! I got stuck with a bill for a membership I had never heard of, and they tacked 7 months of charges onto my credit card after sending me stuff I thought was free. I hate this new marketing scheme, where they give you a membership unbeknownst to you and it is up to you to cancel, else face exuberant charges...I am still fighting the $138.00 bill which is tacked onto my Bank of America credit card.
