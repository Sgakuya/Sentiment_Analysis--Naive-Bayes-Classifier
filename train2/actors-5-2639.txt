I love Edward Norton's work! I first saw him in Primal Fear, and immediately saw potential! Nicolas Cage used to be my favorite, now it's Edward! I especially loved Fight Club! I know it's usually not a chic movie, but I absolutly LOVE IT!!! I also have the biggest crush on him. American History X was GREAT! His body was to die for! He really got pumped! What a hottie! All in all, he's a terrific actor who is definetly going far in life! I admire him a WHOLE lot! -Jessica
