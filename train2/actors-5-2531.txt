Rain Man, Kramer vs, Kramer, All the President's Men, Hook, Tootsie, and The Graduate. If you haven't seen at least three of these movies, please don't think you know anything about this man. He is easily one of the most versatile actors of all time and definitely one man who can not be labeled as playing the same type of character everytime.
