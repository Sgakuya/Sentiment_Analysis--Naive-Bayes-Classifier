This is a very interesting account of Lance Armstrong's journey through hell and triumphant return to professional cycling. It seems that Lance has evolved from a cocky, young race winner to a mature, well-rounded champion who is contributing to the sport of cycling in a multitude of ways. It is truly unbelievable that he has had the time to develop the Lance Armstrong Foundation, write two books, win the Tour de France, get married and have a kid- all since recovering from cancer. This book is not for cyclists only. Anyone seeking inspiration from a miraculous story of survival and triumph would enjoy Lance Armstrong's story.
