So glad to see Eileen back as Ashley. None of the others even came close to her talent. She is exactly what one would picture a rich office executive to be only with a heart. But hey...the writers need to reunite Ashley with Victor. Years ago when they were a couple they ignited the screen with the fire that made daytime television rock.
