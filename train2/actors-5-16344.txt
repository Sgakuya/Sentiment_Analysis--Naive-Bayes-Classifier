MARVELOUS MAURICE! He is SO SPECIAL!! Sonny is yummy because of his portrayer Maurice Benard! I would love to see Maurice in Primetime although I would hate to give up seeing him on GH! His character Sonny is the only reason that I watch GH..I became entranced with him when Vanessa Marcil was his romantic interest Brenda..They should have stayed together but TPTB foolishly let Maurice walk away when his contract was up.. He is back and more exciting and sexy then EVER!!!
