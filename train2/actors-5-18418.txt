 Rashoman (I hope I spelled it right) was the one really great movie that I saw when I took a History of Film course in Princeton's Visual Arts department. The history typically left out most anything remotely popular (except Hitchcock), instead concentrating on Stanley Brakhage and all this psuedo-intellectual nonsense. But Kurosawa's film really was compelling. Actually there was one other great movie in that course; I believe it was Danish and called Ordet -- that was the best one in the course but Rashomon was definitely #2.
