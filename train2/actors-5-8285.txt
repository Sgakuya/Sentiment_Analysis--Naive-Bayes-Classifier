How can any body compare to Lucille Ball? She is the one and only Queen of Comedy. To think that I Love Lucy has been on TV for 50 years. How many TV shows can we say have been on for 50 years? Her wit and charm is greatly one of a kind and unique!!! This is what makes Lucille Ball the true meaning of a classic woman!!! HAPPY 50TH ANNIVERSARY, LUCY!!!!!
