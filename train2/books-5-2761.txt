I like these books personally because I think they are well written and they basically have things in there that me as a teenager can relate to I just recently bought the newest one called chicken soup for the teenage soul on tough stuff. These books canhelp you though because when you write to put a story in you can learn fomr their mistakes and it helps you realize that you life is not that bad so I would say overall these are a good self-help series type of a book.
