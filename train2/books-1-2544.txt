Cathy is one of the most insipid, useless cartoons I have ever had the displeasure of reading. She's a neurotic who should find a decent man and be able to maintain a relationship with one man. I've no patience with these sorts who can't get their head screwed on straight and realize that there are decent men out there. Cathy, get a clue.
