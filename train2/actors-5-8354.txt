Judy Garland did it all; film, tv, radio, vaudeville, personal appearances and recordings. And she did it with such gusto and feeling. Think of all the great moments: Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St. Louis, Carnegie Hall, her television specials and series. As Frank Sinatra said, We will all be forgotten but never Judy.
