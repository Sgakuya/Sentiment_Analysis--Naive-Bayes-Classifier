So boring. Such false attacks and lies about all Muslim people. I've met many Muslims in my life and the ones I met are the most decent, kind citizens of this country. I've never been hit, yelled at, shot at, spit on, raped, sworn at, threatened, or been called bad names by a Muslim. No Muslim has ever called me bad derogatory names. No Muslim ever stole from me or backstabbed me. No Muslim ever took their cigarette and blew smoke in my face.
