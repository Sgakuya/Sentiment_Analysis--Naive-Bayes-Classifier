Capella University is a joke. I have found it to be a money making scam that is more concerned with earning the almighty dollar than with becoming a genuine institution of higher learning. I agree with the comments of others that some schools - especially the School of Psychology and the School of Information Technology are simply horrendous - many students are complaining but these complaints fall on deaf ears. It is disturbing that there are those who seem to think that just because soldiers in Iraq attend Capella suddenly make it some sort of holy grail for them. Sadly, that's not used as an excuse to justify the quality of other universities. Another stupid argument is that because Capella is accreditated means that they're in the same league as the likes of Harvard and Yale. After my experience with Capella, I found that's like comparing a Yugo with a Rolls Royce. It is also disturbing that Capella touts their agreements with big business, even though that that has nothing to do with the quality of their programs. After my experience there, I would never recommend Capella to anyone, for any reason. I'm only sorry that I didn't find out sooner. Glad I got out when I did. I just found another site that tells all about the scam that Capella University really is - it's located at: http://www.capellauniversity.org . That site documents Capella's practice of hiring "teachers" who have bought their degrees from diploma mills, as well as other faculty members who harass students. Don't forget to read the comments of the advertisers on this site - they're the ones who mention things like "FREE" courses - nothing in life is "FREE" and Capella certainly isn't.
