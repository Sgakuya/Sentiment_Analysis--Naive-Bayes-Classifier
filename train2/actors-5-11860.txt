I met Angelina Jolie in the Los Angeles airport this past Wednesday. From some prior publicity I had seen on her, she was made out to be a little quirky. Instead I found her to be one of the most genuinely nice people I have ever had the pleasure to meet. I asked her for an autograph (on her way into the bathroom no less!!) and she was absolutely charming and polite. Even said she didn't need to go, she was just waiting for her Mom. She personalized the autograph for me, then had a 2 or 3 minute conversation with me about normal stuff. Told me where she was headed and I asked her a bit about the Oscars. She was very nice, laughed at my lame attempts at humor, and didn't act the least bit put out. Any doubts I had about her from negative publicity were put to rest forever after meeting her in person. She is utterly charming.
