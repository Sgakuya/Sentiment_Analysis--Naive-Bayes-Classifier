The Jungle is a great book about the loss of innocence. A group of Lithunaians come to America expecting to work and earn a decent salary. Jurgis and Ona are the focus of the story and their love is pure and innocent. However, they quickly find out that there are entire industries waiting to take advantage of poor immigrants, from the Packers to Real Estate companies, pub owners, bosses, police, politicians, etc. Not only does this book show the despair and tragedy of the working poor in America in the early 1900's but it exposes the packing industry's disgusting underbelly. Unfortunately, the main story disintegrates at the end of the book and it becomes more of a dissertation on the benefits of socialism.
