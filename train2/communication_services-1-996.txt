The service is a waste if you have a decent cell phone. Furthermore, their customer service is terrible. They once sent me an extra pager by mistake and didn't know how to resolve it. After I ended service in December and sent the pager back, they are still trying to charge me $400 for the pager. I am having to deny the charge on my credit card.
