I had owned a 1990, a 1992, and now a 1999. All three had transmission problems. I like the car, but I will never buy another minivan from this car maker.My personal opinion is that they do not care to fix the transmission problem and we, the consumer must pay to replace it every 60.000 miles or less. I always said buy american , but my next one will be a Toyota!
