Robin Williams has shown many people that even though life is hard (patch addams), we can still make it. It is so true what eva.2204se said on 12/17/99. A true clown with sorrow and happiness side by side. I have been told that he is a manic depressed man. For him to act as well as he does even when he is so far down, shows he has a real gift. lil_9571om, watch what you say, you never know what your best friend says about you.
