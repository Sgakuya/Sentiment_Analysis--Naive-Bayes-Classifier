Here's an actress with the rare combination of arresting beauty, acting talent, and an interest in choosing diverse, challenging roles. I have to admit I didn't think she was much more than a (very) pretty face when I first saw her in The Rocketeer, but after her performances in Requiem for a Dream and A Beautiful Mind, I'm really impressed. Did I mention she's, like, good-looking and stuff?
