Never again. Lived here for one year, and was glad to flee to a smaller town in Michigan, where the locals are far nicer and less racist. I have family that live here, and this city has perversed them. My cousin is brown-skinned and he tells me he's white. My aunt is an arrogant yuppie who spares no expense in showing off. Every time I go back to Cincinnati, I see nothing has changed. This was the first city I moved to in the US from the West Indies, and it wasn't a good first impression. I had previously visited New York City and liked it. However, something is wrong with this place; avoid it.
