Tom Hanks is such a believable actor. He has done so many great movies! We recently saw him in Cast Away and I was amazed at the work he went through in preparation for the movie - the pounds he put on and the everyday, cuddly look he had at the beginning and then the lean, ripped look he had when he left the island - he is truly an award-winning actor!!
