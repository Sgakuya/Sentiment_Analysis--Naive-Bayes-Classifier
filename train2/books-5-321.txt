Originally published in 1983, Getting To Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In is a book which examines the differences between two styles of negotiation: one being based on position, the other based on principles. The overall conclusion of the authors' analysis is that principled based negotiations are far superior to those position based, and they offer real world examples. The authors' four principles are 1) separate the people from the problem, 2) focus on interests instead of positions, 3) develop several options prior to reaching an agreement, and 4) insist on objective criteria for the agreement. Getting To Yes can be purchased new for about $12 in paperback.
