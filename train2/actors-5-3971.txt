I absolutely adore Ralph Fiennes. His entire performance in The English Patient is plainly brilliant. Its for that performance alone that I give him this rating. He WAS the movie. I can't even describe how moved I was by him. Its one of the greatest films, that one. And he deserves every bit of acclaim he gets for his talent.
