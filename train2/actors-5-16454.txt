He is both gorgeous and talented! Not only is he a wonder in the acting field, but also a great athlete and very loyal to his fans! He is under appreciated as so many actors and actresses are on GH these days. I think he deserves more and better. Overall I would say he is a beautiful human being inside and out and am missing him very much this summer!
