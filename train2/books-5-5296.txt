I could NOT put this book down! It is an incredible book, the interwoven story lines are intriguing and engrossing. I can't believe it is only Lamb's second work. Lamb is one of those gifted authors that is so believable that you think the story is autobiographical. The novel searches the past for answers to the present and future beautifully.
