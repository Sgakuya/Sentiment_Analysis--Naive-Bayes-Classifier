 Quit possibly the best actor of his generation. As I am an actor myself I hold Edward Norton on a pedastal. Ever since I first saw him in his ground breaking role, in an otherwise very lame Richard Gere flick, Primal Fear I have looked up to this man ever since. His versatility and talent are immeasurable. As an actor and even as a director he knows just what to do. He has proven to be one of the best actors around in such unforgettable films like American History X, Fight Club and Keeping the Faith. I hope to see Ed around for a long long time. He is a great inspiration and my favorite actor. Check any of his movies out. No matter how crap the film might seem,if he is in it, he will make the movie.
