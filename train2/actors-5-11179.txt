Honestly I don't think you can judge Kidman by Eyes Wide Shut. Kubrick may have been a legend who made some of the greatest movies of all time but Eyes Wide Shut was not one of them. The movie had an interesting concept, but to be brutally honest I think it was over-produced and the characters were weakly written. You could tell that, not just Kidman, but Cruise as well as everyone else in the supporting cast was really struggling to bring their characters to life... She turned a runaway slut with no self-esteem into an endearing character in Practical Magic. I didn't think it was possible for a Hollywood starlet to convincingly pull-off a brilliant, no-nonsense nuclear physicist but she proved otherwise (in my eyes) in The Peacemaker (and her character was still likeable). Whether or not you liked Far and Away, I think she totally came through as a spoiled rich yet brave and starry-eyed brat slowly learning how to rough-it in 19th century America. And she completely blew me away in Moulin Rouge. It's like, she's very beautiful, but when I see her, I never feel that bitter and envious little inferiority complex stirring in my subconscious. I think she always manages to make her characters believable and likable, and she never seems to act very Hollywood if you know what I mean.
