Cell One has now decided that they need to charge an administrative fee to do a job they're already supposed to do, monitor accounts for spending limits! They can change a legal and binding contract without the customer having any choice. Just try to get out of your contract with them and you'll face a substantial penalty. They are offering you the option of canceling your service with them if you don't want to pay this fee. You have to do this prior to 14 days upon receipt of this notice which is enclosed in your bill. If you don't check your mail on time you have lose your option to cancel without facing a penalty. This month my bill was late! Seems to be orchestrated and manipulative! What if you live in an area (Elko Nevada) where they are the only cell service! What a scam! They have a monopoly and the customers are getting raped with no other choice. Research into other cell companies has revealed that no other cell company is allowed into the service area and are being blocked out. My need for a cell phone is for business communications and is needed to stay in business. If you go over your plan minutes beware. The cost is exhorbitant and unjustified. And if you go over some preset spending limit your service will be suspended until you make an immediate payment by phone or credit card. Don't waste your time calling customer service if it's too late in the day. Cell One no longer has 24 hour customer service, they discontinued it! They are getting more money but they are giving less service. This company is owned by Western Wireless who is one of the major wireless companies and cornering the cell market. It someone doesn't stop this they will be the only choice and then the consumers will suffer the consequenses financially. CONSUMER BEWARE!!!!!
