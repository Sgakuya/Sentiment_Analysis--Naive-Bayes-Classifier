I finally saw Austin Powers 2 the other night, and I was angry throughout the entire movie because they teased us with one minute of Elizabeth Hurley right at the start (just enough time to remind us of how hot she is) and then got rid of her. The whole rest of the movie I was just wishing she would come back.
