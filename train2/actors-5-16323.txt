While shopping last week, I came into view of a television which was showing General Hospital. I was so captivated by Sonny and his incredible acting. After pulling myself away, I could not resist taping the show the next day. I have taped the show every day since and rewatch the scenes with Sonny in them. He has melted my heart and the show has gained a new and faithful viewer.
