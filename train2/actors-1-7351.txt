Many have stated that Vin could be the next action star. If they're refering to all the generic, mind numbing, corny standards that make up the bad qualities of some action stars, they're right. He is flat when it comes to his characters having any life an emmotion. HE also likes to shoot out those corny catch phrases (most evident in XXX.....and that movier was suppose to issue in the new brand to spy that's better than James Bond...YEAH RIGHT!!!!). Vin needs a lot of improving and fast.
