DO NOT go for this insurance comapany!!!! After I signed up the Quote seamed to increase dramatically. Not even insured for 27 Days I received 2 bills (within 2 days) one more expensive than the other. When I decided to cancel after being told that once the the rates are finalized I have the right to cancel with out the 50.00 cancellation fee they wanted to charge me. On 8-3-05 I called to cancel and was told by 2 representatives that I would not be charged the fee. Well they charged me anyway. I am in the process of fighting this. I am now told they cannot waive the fee. From what I was told yesterday that all calls are recorded I am demanding they pull my recorded 2 calls and verify what I was told. Dealing with this company has been nothing but stress, money and valuable time out of my work day that I can never get back. Try farmers insurance they are a lot cheaper. DO NOT CHOOSE ESURANCE!!!!!!!!!!
