Where to start. I purchased wireless internet from cellular 1, had horrible problems with it. No tech help, spotty reception, and screwed up bills for months. The techs kept telling me the tower had blown breakers often (the supposid reason for my net outages) when in fact they had turned off my internet usage for possible piracy activities. This went on for about 9 months before I finally stormed into their office and demanded to know what was going on, and only then was I told that they had (illegally) searched my computer and found what they thought was pirated material and were shutting off my internet connection for days at a time. I said screw it, take me off of your service, and they wanted 400 bucks for an early termination which I didn't feel I should have had to pay for the shotty and illegal searches they were preforming. Filed a BBB complaint and had my lawyers contact them, and they suddenly relented and let me out of my contract for nothing. That took almost 3 months to accomplish. HORRIBLE service, snotty employees, and illegal searches of your personal property. Never will I do business with them again.
