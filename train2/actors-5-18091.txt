Amber, the little vixen girl on B B... wow! Adrienne does a GREAT job as Amber on B B, the girl who's infatuated with Rick, and will do anything to get him, good or bad... well, really, Amber USED to be bad, but the character has definitely grown up over the years, and isn't the user she once was... she's become a good woman, for Rick, for little Eric, for everyone--she isn't who she once was.
