This is without a doubt THE most butt-ugly car ever created. I saw one coming down the street a few days ago and wondered how the person driving could take himself seriously. Aesthetically and visually offensive - best purchased by those who enjoy the ambiance of a gas station - since you'll be spending a lot of time there.
