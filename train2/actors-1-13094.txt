When someone asks you a question about a celebrity couple and you respond with a tirade about the Sudan, then you have opened the door yourself to criticism of your politics and beliefs. Liberals think free speech means we all have to shut up and listen to them without responding. Too bad. Susan Sarandon is an idiot. She is not a great actress, she is a great liberal and we are told she's brilliant because of it. I've never seen any actor who appeared so aware of their own celebrity in every role. When she comes into a scene, she pauses for some phantom applause we can't hear. We're also told she's beautiful and she looks like an old whore. I've never seen her manage to make an emotion look real, other than her misinformed self righteous contempt for this country and everything it stands for. She also bad-mouths her mother to her children because her mother is a conservative. Grandma is a stupid old bitty. How lovely and open-minded. Yeah, her children are making their minds up for themselves, aren't they? She's so damn special. Let's forget she ever existed.
