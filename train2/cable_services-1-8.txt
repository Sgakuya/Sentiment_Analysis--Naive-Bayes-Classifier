The worst customer service I have ever experienced with any company. My cable was out 4 days, before they scheduled a technician to come out and fix it Sunday morning. When the guy didn't show up, I called Cox, only to find that they don't do repairs on Sunday. I especially like dealing with the call center, and its minimum-wage morons.
