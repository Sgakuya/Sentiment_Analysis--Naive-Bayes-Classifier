I don't know why, but this comic strip reminds me a bit of the fantastic Calvin and Hobbes, only that this one is told from teenager's point of view. It is hilarious to see how Jeremy's parents are going crazy because of his rebellious attitude, and even though it may be a bit exaggerated, I think most of us can identify with Jeremy (who hasn't ever been harassed by school,homework etc?)
