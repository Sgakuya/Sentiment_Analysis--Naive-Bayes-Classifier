This service is really quite bad, and I would strongly urge folks not to get locked into a 1-year contract (VoicePulse fights tooth and nail to keep you from breaking the contract). The problems with the service are threefold: (1) poor call quality and reception (echo, garbling, etc.), (2) attrocious reliability (inability to make outgoing calls or receive incoming calls), (3) poor customer service availability (only available 9-5 M-F). Customer service, while friendly, will make you jump through hoops instead of accepting responsibility for problems on their end. For example, customer service made me run 24-hour Pingplotter tests on my Linksys Wireless-G router when I complained about the call quality. I have since switched to Vonage and the call quality is excellent. And, best of all, I didn't have to run any stupid Pingplotter tests.
