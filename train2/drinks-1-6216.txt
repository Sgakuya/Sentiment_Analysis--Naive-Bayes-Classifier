Horrible disgusting crap. I hate it, they tried to copy the success of Vanilla Coke and they failed miserably. It tastes like crap, it has none of the smoothness or delicious flavor. I mean, Pepsi sucks big-time, and they try to copy a delicious Coca-Cola success and they BOTCH it. I had little respect for Pepsi before this, and now I have none. I toured the Coca-Cola factory, and it's great! Pepsi sucks, Coke is good, that's it. And this new product seals the deal. Pepsi is lying, cheating, poopy-doo, copycat SCUM!
