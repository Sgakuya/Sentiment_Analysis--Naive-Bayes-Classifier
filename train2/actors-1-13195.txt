So! She is leaving the U.S. forever if G.W. Bush becomes president. The only downside to her leaving is that she didn't mention taking Hanoi Jane with her. Whatever talent she may have as an actress is overshadowed by her leftist political views. The U.S. will do just fine without her. The third world is a good place for her to stay. I only hope the State Department makes her departure permanent by removing her citizenship.
