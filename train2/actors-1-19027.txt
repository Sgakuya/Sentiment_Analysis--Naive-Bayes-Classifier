He was probably the most known for being one of the worst directors ever.I got to admit that I tried out a couple of his movies for curiosity.they were pretty campy and unintentionally funny. He seemed to march to his own drummer. I saw the movie ED Wood , and one thing i thought was nice is his befriending Bela Lugosi.Ed Wood was eccentric and did not have a talent for directing, but at least he seemed to be a nice guy .
