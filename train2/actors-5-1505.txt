Morgan Freeman is a serious actor who is long overdue for an Oscar. He has gravitas, that quality which exudes confidence and weight. When he's onscreen I am drawn right into his character. "Seven" was one of my favorites (he put Brad Pitt in the shade in that one) but Shawshank and Driving Miss Daisy were excellent. Actually, I've seen every movie he ever made, and there isn't a bad performance in any of them. If someone says they don't like Morgan Freeman then one has to wonder what sort of movies they DO like. If a movie critic is excited by "Dumb and Dumber" kind of movies they might not appreciate Morgan Freeman but any real movie buff will know what a powerhouse talent Freeman is.
