Massachusetts is one of the worst places to live. It's the armpit of the United States. The weather, people and job market sucks. I live in California now and everything is awesome. The weather, women and scenery are beautiful. The people are friendly and job market is really good. All you people that think Massachusetts is so grand, must have something wrong with you. Have fun!!!...........oh by the way...how's the weather?......ha!ha!ha! You Suck!!!
