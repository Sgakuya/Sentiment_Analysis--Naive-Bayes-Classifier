I have just got back from a weekend in budapest. I was a big disappointment. It could be such a wonderful destination but until the hungarians learn to behave and stop their petty crime on tourists I will not be recommending budapest as a holiday for anyone. Our luggage was tampered with and upon reporting my missing items found out that Bupapest airport is having trouble with their thiefing staff. (acutally its the other countries having the trouble) Its a shame as the city has fantastic buildings and a rich culture. People seem nice but it is only later that you relise they have robbed you with a smile. Shop keepers are always trying to shortchange you and even when you catch them or confront them, they know you are powerless and so they still dont give you all your change back. If you must go there, stick to large stores and dont buy anything just before closing time. I even got ripped off in a reasonable size supermarket by a checkout assistant, in the end it was still her word against mine in the size of the note I gave her. The currency is NOT confusing as the notes are also different colours but the hungarians think that we are confused by it and so they try to rip you off. I know the difference between a blue note 1000 and a red 500 so I cant see how they think we are so stupid. Kick them out of the EU or halt their progress until they grow up. The only thing that they have embraced since the fall of communism is their love for petty crime. It is also getting expensive for the budget traveller. This is a group they havent gotten used to. Since they have joined the EU and you can take cheap flights there, the budget traveller will find hungarians think you are rich and dont give you the same treatment as they do to there own, like returning ones change back or hasseling you for big tips. I have a tip - BEHAVE!
