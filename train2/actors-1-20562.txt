IT IS TOO BAD THAT THIS RATING SYSTEM DOESN'T LET YOU SUBMIT 1/2 OF A STAR, BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'D GIVE THIS NO-TALENT!!!! WHY DO PEOPLE THINK EVERYONE IS JEALOUS OF THIS AIR-HEAD...FACE IT PEOPLE, THE REASON MOST OF US DO NOT CARE FOR HER IS ABSOLUTELY NOT JEALOUSY, IT IS RATHER THAT THIS GIRL CANNOT ACT OR SING AT ALL!!!! I MEAN, MY CAT SINGS BETTER THAT THIS BALLOON HEAD. I AGREE WITH THE PERSON WHO REVIEWED HER SAYING THAT SHE NEEDS TO GET A JOB AT BURGER KING...THAT'S MORE HER SPEED.
