It's funny how a book can so totally turn you off in the first chapter and then leave you absolutely hooked by the last. That's exactly how this introduction to Hemingway's sardonic style affected me in high school. My disgust for what I perceived as toneless, depressing drunken tales truned to pity for any man whose thoughts could be so dark and then finally sheer admiration-awe. Even for a mind that could see the world so clearly for all its sad, bitter, aimless, rich, irony, could see it all without shattering.
