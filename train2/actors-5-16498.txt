Rick Hearst is the ONLY reason I watch daytime TV. He's a fantastic actor who deserves much better than to be in M. Benard's shadow all the time. Looking forward to his movie coming to the theaters. Hope he can make the move to full-time acting in feature films and prime time TV, if they're not going to give him the respect and roles he deserves in daytime.
