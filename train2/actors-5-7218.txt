I think Roberto Benigni is incredibly talented. He has brought a lot of awarenss to forgien films as well as a new life to films in the US. Life is Beautiful was an amazing movie and he is a great actor, director and writter. He is so full of life and happiness. I loved watching how excited he got during the Oscars.
