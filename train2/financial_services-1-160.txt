Beware of Citizens Bank!In our estimation their practices are immoral, inhumane and illegal. Citizens Bank foreclosed and auctioned our business because we always paid our mortgage during the grace period. After nine years they decided this did not suit them and with no prior notice they called in our loan [just before Christmas]. On June 24th, they auctioned our property for one million dollars less than it's worth. We owned our business [a motel on cape cod] for 16 years. It was our entire life and supposed to be our retirement. Thanks to Citizens Bank, we are now homeless, our business is gone and we have no retirement. Hopefull they are not your typical bank. They are a huge corporation who think it's a joke to crush people. Citizens Bank -- they don't have a rating low enough for them!
