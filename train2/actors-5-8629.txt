Ava Gardner is probably the most beautiful woman to grace the screen... EVER! But she wasn't only nice to look at, this girl had cojones! She illuminated the screen with her boldness and her charisma! When she married Frank Sinantra, someone asked her once why she would be attracted to a shrimp who weighed 100 pounds soak and wet to which she replied Because 1 pound is Frank and the other 99 pounds is pure C**K! Wasn't she awesome??
