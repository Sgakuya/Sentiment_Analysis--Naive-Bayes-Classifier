I agree with some of the people above regarding overdrafts. I too have been charged excessive fees by US Bank. Like the user above, I had a big item clear first and then overdrafted some little ones so they could charge me 6 fees instead of 1. If the big item had come on a different day then I could understand the fees but they all cleared on the same day. If you overdraw your account by 3.75 and get charged 31.00 for a fee, it is ridiculous. They also have poor customer service on the telephone, you never get to talk to anyone higher up than who answers your call, they practically refuse to give you a name of a supervisor. Five star service guarantee, HA HA, they need lessons in service. My recommendation, don't bank at US Bank. There are plenty of other banks out there with far better service and overdraft policies.
