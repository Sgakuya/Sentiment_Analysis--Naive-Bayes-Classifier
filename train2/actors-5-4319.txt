wow! in the contender i developed a major crush on jeff bridges.in the contender, he bully's christian slater, harangue's joan allen, sabatoges gary oldham and, simultaneously, it seems he's charming them off their feet. How? the presidential role just exquisitely played by jeff. can we see jeff in more of these misguided, egotistical, flawed characters doused in charisma.
