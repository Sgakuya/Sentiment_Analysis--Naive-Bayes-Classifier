Similar to the far superior Snickers, except that the coating is made of the loathsome white chocolate -- that abomination unto god and man, the bete noire of true chocolate connoiseurs everywhere. (It is beyond me how anyone can dignify that white stuff by calling it chocolate.) Zero is exactly how many stars this thing deserves.
