Let''s be real!!!! Shirley Temple has to be #1. Who else can you think of in movie history had more popularity and did many different roles and loved by all. She could play drama, comedy, musicals and could dance. If you ever saw her when Dancing with Bill Bojangles Robinson in THE LITTLE COLONEL (1935). Then there is no argument, especially when you think of the word 'stairs'.
