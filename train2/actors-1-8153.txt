If Henry Fonda had not been her father, I doubt that she would have gotten very far. As far as her Vietnam era record goes, it's probably not germane to the issue of her as an actress, but I'm always intrigued by how easily liberals seem to be faced facts and come up with alternative theories as to what actually happened or was said.
