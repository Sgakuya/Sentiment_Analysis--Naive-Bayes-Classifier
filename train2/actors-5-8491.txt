The last time I remember seeing her on TV was Curb Your Enthusiasm and she was with her dear husband, Mel Brooks, and looked beautiful. Her acting range was so wide. She played a nun in Agnes of God and a seductress in The Graduate with many more films and stage plays in between. Loved her sense of humor, too.
