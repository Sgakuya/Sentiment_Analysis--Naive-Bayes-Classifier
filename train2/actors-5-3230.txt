I love Steve Buscemi to death! I go and watch movies because he is in them. Even if he only has a bit part, he steals the whole show. The man is a genius, definately the coolest guy in the world. I seriously don't think he wastes his time in Sandler films, i truly think he enjoys what he does. It is a delight to see him appear in ANY type of movie.He is beautiful because of the enjoyment he brings to his fans. His personality is even more so. He definately deserves so much more credit than he gets.
