I can't stand Meg Ryan, therefore I cannot watch When a Man Loves a Woman however I have seen Andy in everything but that and The Godfather. Andy ooozes this sensuality and sexuality that cannot be denied. I feel the same about Richard Gere. Five minutes with Andy is all I'd need to rock his boat. Don't get me started. I love him most in For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story. Is he just sexy to me, or do others feel the same?
