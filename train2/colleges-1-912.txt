Don't listen to above post. This school is all about the money. The education is less than stellar for the amount you pay. A community college offers better than this school! Here you pay 6k a semester as compared to 300-400 at your local community colloge, 1-1.5k for csu, 2k for uc. Overall most other colleges are cheaper than this school and offer you more. I highly don't reccomend this school. Most other private trade schools I would steer away from as well.
