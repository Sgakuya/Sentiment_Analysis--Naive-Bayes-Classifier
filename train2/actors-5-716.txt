Norman Bates was a double edged sword, in the movie 'Psycho' as well as in Tony Perkins' career. Of course, it's one of the greatest performances of all time, but at the same time it really ruined Tony's career. Why not watch Tony in such films as Friendly Persuasion or Goodbye Again for which he rightfully won much acclaim? Even the Psycho sequels are not all that bad. Tony was an incredibly versatile actor, but is always overshadowed by Bates.
