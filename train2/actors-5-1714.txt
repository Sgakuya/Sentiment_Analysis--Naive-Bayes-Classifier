Someone told me he has a perfect face (it has to do with a study that envolves schemes of simetry... but you have to contact Reader's Digest if you want to know more, that's were I read it). Anyway, he's not only perfect in his looks, he also is fabulous and seeing him on a role makes my shivering inside. He's incredible.
