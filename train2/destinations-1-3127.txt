A flaccid, boring, New York wannabee of a city, that doesn't have the sophistication in its entire metro area that NY has in two blocks. It is peopled by ignorant, arrogant, unfriendly people who seem to think that Canada stops fifty miles away from Yonge Street. It is easily the most uninteresting city of its size on the continent. It used to be called Hogtown. It still should be. And yes, I've been there, all too bloody often.
