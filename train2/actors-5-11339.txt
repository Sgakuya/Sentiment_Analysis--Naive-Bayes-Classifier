Naomi Watts is very talented, courageous, and also very beautiful. She is one of my favorite actresses, and I have posters of her on my walls. Mulholland Drive was a great movie, and I can't wait to see 21 Grams. The Ring was also good, but it scared me. I also have respect for her because she's not afraid to do a lesbian scene if she has to. Where most actresses would be like OK, I'm not doing this!
