People say that you have to live in new england to like moxie. I do, and what do you know? I still hate it! It's extremely bitter, no real taste at all, and the smell is overwhelming. I guess if you mixed molasses with the darkest, unsweetened black coffee you could find, you might have something close to moxie. I think the reason it's called moxie is because you have to have guts to drink that crap!
