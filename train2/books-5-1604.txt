This strip should be at the top, or at least number two! Classic characters and perfectly timed dialogue! Nobody does it better! To see RAISING DUNCAN (insipid) and KEVIN AND KELL (too much in speak) and SAFE HAVENS (over-talkie dialogues with no real pay-off or funny character exposition) rated higher on this list than BLOOM COUNTY, well, it's just laughable.
