My feelings toward this book is that it shows me that there is always a way to overcome from the most horrible things that people face in life. Dave Pelzer provides affirmation that the cycle of abuse can be broken. Dave is a living example that all of us have the capability to better ourselves no matter what the odds. This book was a well written book because it showed in great detail Pelzer's maltreatment better than any book can describe. I recommend this book to other teenagers because after you read this book you feel that there is always a hope and other chance of life.
