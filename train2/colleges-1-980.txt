There is something about colleges like this that make a person's overall outlook on life very wrong. The whole personality of Stanford graduates often seems very fake and pretentious. Condescending philanthropy at best and over-inflated yuppie egos at worst, I give Stanford one star. Of course in terms of raw academics (computer science etc.) it is very good.
