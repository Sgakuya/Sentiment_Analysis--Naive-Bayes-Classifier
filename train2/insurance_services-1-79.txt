BEWARE OF FEES!!! Just cancelled my policy that I heve had for over two years and was informed that there is a mid term cancellation fee of $50 that I will be charged. I WAS STUNNED!! I have had car insurance for almost twenty years with several different companies and NEVER was charged an early cxl fee by any of them. Not that I jump from company to company all the time ( I could understand an early cxl fee in the first six months or something to prevent this) but when a better deal comes along I take it. They say it is in my purchase agreement that they supposedly informed me of two years ago so there is no way of having it waived. This is even though I am unable to access my policy information online ( it still only shows my previous term that expired before my renewal in July) what good is this policy if I cannot even print insurance cards? BOTTOM LINE STAY AWAY FROM THIS CROOKED COMPANY!!! Tell everyone you know! If you want to by insurance online buy from a reputable established company such as Geico or Progressive. They may cost a few bucks more but it's a small price to pay to avoid the hassles!
