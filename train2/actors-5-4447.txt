David Duchovny is one of the most talented actor in the world. He can show more emotion in his beautiful eyes than anything found in dialogues.He is such a expressive and multi-talented actor whose range works on many different levels.A mere inflection of his voice adds an unexpected nuance to a scene. David Duchovnys choices continue to reflect his desire to play a broad range of parts. His acting is so powerful. David nails scenes so easily, sometimes he never says a word, but his body language and his facial expression says everything. He didnt need to be so sexy, handsome and funny. :)
