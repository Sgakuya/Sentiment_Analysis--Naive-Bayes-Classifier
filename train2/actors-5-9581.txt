From the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com) about Catherine: 'Catherine Zeta Jones was born on September 25, 1969, in Swansea, West Glamorgan, Wales, UK... Her father is Dai Jones, mother Pat Jones. Catherine has 2 brothers: David who was born in 1967, and Lyndon, who was born in 1972. Catherine showed an interest early on in entertainment. She sang and danced her way to local stardom before she was 10 years old, as a part of a Catholic congregation's performing troupe. She later starred on stage in the musicals of Annie, The Pajama Game, and Bugsy Malone. At 15, Catherine haad the lead in the British revival of 42nd Street. She was originally cast as the second understudy for the lead role in the musical, but when both the star and the first understudy became sick the night that the play's producer was in the audience, she was given the lead for the rest of the musical's production.' I think that gives enough of Catherine's Theatre credentials, don't you? For those of you complaining that she is saying she older than what she is: as she was born in 1969, this would make her only 34...? What is your complaint? So someone's sister -who is 39- went to school with Catherine, big deal! If I had been 5 years younger, I could say that I went to school with John Your Body is a Wonderland Mayer! I admit that she is not Bebe Neuwirth (Velma Kelly) or Ann Reinking (Roxie Hart) in the Broadway revival of CHICAGO, nor is she Chita Rivera (Velma Kelly) or Gwen Verdon (Roxie Hart) of the Original Broadway cast, but who is???Catherine should not have to be. I was thrilled with Catherine's performance as Velma Kelly, and I thought Renee Zellweger did a superb job as Roxie Hart... Keep up the good work, Catherine!!!
