Her education seems similar to Jodie Foster's...she has the potential to be a great actress. But what really gives her a thumbs up by me right now is that she's so hot and play's all the sex bomb/sex toy roles in movies. And that she's worked with an asian guy, Chow Yun Fat, as well as can speak fluent Chinese...I'm pretty impressed and charmed. Definitely, one to remember.
