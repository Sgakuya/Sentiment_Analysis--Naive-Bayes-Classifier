Alluring. Sensual. Mesmerizing. What more can I say about the Brat Prince? This book was very well written, and I have to admit...I am a lover of the Vampire Lestat. He was made into such a beautiful character, and his story is spun so well throughout the story from beginning to end. It also shows him in a much different light than Louis portrayed him in Interview with the Vampire. I would definetely suggest this book to anyone who even has the slightest inkling about Lestat and his life, mortal and immortal.
