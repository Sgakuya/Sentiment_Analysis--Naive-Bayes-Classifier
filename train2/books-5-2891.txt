This book is absolutely mesmerising and worth reading. The grandaughter tells us of the lives of herself, her mother and grandmother. It ranges from the time when Chinese women had to bind their feet and follow the orders of their husbands, to when people wanted communism and fought that, to when communism turned into a nightmare to present day. It is a fantastic voyage through time that'll make you gasp. Read it.
