One of my favourite directors. While I disagree with some of the casting choices in his movies, no one else has such a flair for the visual. His sets and costumes are works of art, and the way they're shot is absolutely marvelous. Fav's include: Ed Wood, Nightmare Before Christmas, Sleepy Hollow, and Edward Scissorhands. The first two Batman movies were also the only ones worth seeing (I wouldn't accept money to see the non-Burton Batman movies again). Mars Attacks and Planet of the Apes were pretty bad, but at least they were visually spectacular.
