I would prefer not to judge anyone; However, I certainly would have to say that Drew Barrymore is exceptional at her job. I recently finished watching her movie Never Been Kissed for the upteenth time and yet I still find myself weeping. Ms. Barrymore is able to move one so emotionally. I can only hope that she not only continues in her profession but that she also continues to do it well. All I can say, in closing, is Thank You
