He has played some of the more interesting roles i have seen. I liked him in Edward Scissorhands, the manufactured man created by a scientist who had scissors for hands. he was good in What's eating Gilbert Grape, and EdWood. He is not afraid to be out there with his roles. he was also very funny in Pirates of the Carribean. looking forward to seeing Finding Neverland.
