The positive ratings on here are obviously Management employees because... well, they gotta be kidding! Yes Telus's reception is good. However you only need to be burned by their exhorbinant cancellation fees once to never, ever, be their customer again. Also I found (after a $600 monthly bill) that they never attempt to help you minimize your bill. You are on your own in trying to research the plans to keep your billl at a reasonable level. I am paying my $480 cancellation charge with a feeling of relief knowing I won't have to deal with them anymore.
