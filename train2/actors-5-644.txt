The best dancer in the movies of all time. He was innovative, a perfectionist and sheer class. I read a biography on him and he seemed a wonderful person and I hoped his second marriage to Robyn Smith was happy. However, I doubt this was the case after reading what Robyn has done since Fred's death. I was appalled to read that Robyn has filed lawsuit, after lawsuit, after lawsuit to gain money off Fred's name, to the point where Fred's own daughter did not have her permission to publicly view her own father's work. Here is where you can read about what Robyn Smith Astaire has done to destroy the Astaire family and good name: http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/060298/ent_she.shtml
