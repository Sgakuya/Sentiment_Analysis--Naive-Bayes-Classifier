Marlboro was the first cigarette I smoked. I liked it at first because I had nothing to compare it to. After I started smoking Camels, smoking Marlboros was hell. They are the cigarettes which contain the most chemicals and they are very harsh. I hate this brand because it makes me sick. I definitely don't recommend Marlboros.
