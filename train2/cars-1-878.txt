I purchased a new polaris virage in May of 2000. The MFDI (multi function device) went out twice and cost me $500 to replace each time. The impeller went out and cost $375 to fix. The electronis went out and cost over $250 to fix. Next the engine blew and cost over $1,200 to fix. The Polaris factory was of no help since all this started happening just after the warranty expired. I threatened to take them to small claims court and they could have cared less. I am trading this Virage in on a new machine this year and it will NOT be any Polaris JUNK!
