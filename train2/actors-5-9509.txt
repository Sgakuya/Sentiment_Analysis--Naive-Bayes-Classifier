I have been in love with Sally Field since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. She is the cutest gal, even now at her age, to me. Her excitable, bubbly personality, cute smile, pug nose...WOW, I'm getting hot. Loved her in Gidget, the Flying Nun, and most of her movies. She is a delicious, delectable sexy little tart in Stay Hungry. If she's single again, think I'll move to Hollywood. ;) Growl
