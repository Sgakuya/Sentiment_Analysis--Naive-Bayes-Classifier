Stanley Kubrick is certainly controversial which should be a clue to his influence and importance. Whether one likes his work or not, most everyone is familiar with his landmark films (ie Spartacus (1960), Lolita (1962), Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb (1964), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971), The Shining (1980), and Full Metal Jacket (1987)). As others have noted, Kubrick's use of color and extended, unedited scenes gave his films an epic feel leaving his work recognizable without having to read the credits.
