Blown head gasket at 64000 miles that resulted in engine needing to be replaced. Replacement cost $4000 of which Ford paid $2000. They took 11 weeks to replace the engine and only provided partial reimbursement for rental car expenses. We are taking Ford to small claims court and will never buy another Ford. Their customer reps are horrible to deal with and their dealership service departments are incompetent
