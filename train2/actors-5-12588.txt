Sexy, spunky, and oh-so-snuggleable, Ms. Fonda is easily one of the MooCow's favorite Snugglebunnies! She has a smile that would melt even the furriest cow heart, and has shown a remarkably cowsistant pattern of good performances in substandard films. In good films(Jackie Brown, Single White Female, Road to Wellville), she can dominate the screen. Too bad she seems to have disappeared from the radar screen; it may very well be that this smart, effecacious snugglebunny has found life outside of Hollywood, in which case the whole herd wishes her all the best. :=8)
