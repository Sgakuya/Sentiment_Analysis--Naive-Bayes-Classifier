Great book by Shakespeare! Not my favourite, but nonetheless still an amazing work of art! The themes, the characters, everything! Edmund- great villain! Edgar-one of my favourites! Very genuine! Gloucester- I cried when you had your eyes put out. I loved you man! I actually cried a lot in this book, also when Lear died, and when Lear carried Cordelia's dead body! Very emotional play filled with tragedy, but Shakespeare's best plays are the tragedies!
