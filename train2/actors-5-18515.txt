The Godfather of the New York Police/Crime Drama. Started his career back in the late 50s with a skillful movie adaptation of the classic courtroom drama, 12 Angry Men. Later found his niche in NYC-based police/crime dramas, directing Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon (Al Pacino's first major movies), Prince of the City, and my personal favorite, Q&A (an outstanding movie with an especially impressive performance by Nick Nolte as a rogue cop working for the Mafia). Lumet was limited in his range, but he was very, very good at his job.
