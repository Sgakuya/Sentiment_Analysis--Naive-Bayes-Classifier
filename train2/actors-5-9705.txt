She is truly a starlet . She pulls ranks with all Hollywood superstars. She is a classic in her own time. She emits such glamour, poise, and class. Her sense of style is almost unmatched. Her performance in Elizabeth has been unmatched since in Hollywood. I feel she was robbed of her award, it was much more deserved by her than Ms. Paltrow.
