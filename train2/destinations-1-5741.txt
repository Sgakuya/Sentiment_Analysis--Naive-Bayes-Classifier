I live in a beautiful state that actually has 4 seasons, unlike Florida. Illinois has snow in the winter and is hotter than Florida in the summer. I wouldn't mind living in Florida if it wasn't for the HURRICANES that they get??? Give me a break. I am still mezmerized by the fact that they are called the Sunshine State. I have been in Florida ALOT of times... it is either sunny or RAINING. 50% for either pretty much. NO THANKS, I think I would rather have a Christmas where my kids can build a snowman -- and a summer where my kids can say ha, ha... its hotter here than it is in Florida right now!!! Florida is crap.
