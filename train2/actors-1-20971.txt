If you lined up Roseanne Barr, Kathy Lee Gifford, and Kirstie Alley, then gave me the power to make one of them vanish from the face of the earth, I would be stumped. You can make such a great case for banishing each of them. But Roseanne, at least, has a sense of humor. And I like listening to Howard Stern make fun of Kathy Lee. So that leaves us with Kirstie Alley, who has absolutely no redeeming qualities that make her worthy of remaining on the planet. So I would say adios, Ms. Alley!
