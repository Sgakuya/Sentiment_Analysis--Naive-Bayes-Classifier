There's something about RAM's it hard to put a finger on but RAM owners seem to have an attitude. Maybe it's like they have to prove their RAM's are better then your Chevy or Ford. Scarey :( Scarey :( Actually Intrepid and Bonnieville drivers are about on par with the RAM drivers. The new RAM's look a ton better than the old ones buttt it hard to take a Chrysler truck serious with Chryslers quality record. Maybe that's why the RAM drivers have an attitude - they are all P__ed Off about their trucks quality! :) Peace Brother! :)
