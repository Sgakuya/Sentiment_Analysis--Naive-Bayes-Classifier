( Total ascerbic tone)....... This epic piece of literature...... is nothing but mindless, liberal propaganda meant to discredit the Bush admin. and the Republican party. Nothing that comes from the mind of this crackpot can be taken at face value. He will always try to scewer the view of the truth to fit his warped mind and ideologies. America, it is time to wake up and see that the Democrats are no longer looking out for the working man in this country. The Dems are today what the Socialists were in the USSR 25 years ago. They are Communists who want everything they can get their paws on and want you to be completely dependent on them. And the Republicans want the businesses to own it all and determine what is right for the people. So do us all a favor.... Vote! But vote for third party candidates who have never been in office before. Maybe one of them can help straighten this country out.
