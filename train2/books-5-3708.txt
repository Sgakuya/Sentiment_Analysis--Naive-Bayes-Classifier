I loved this book. I don't know how I read it because I was thirteen. It's intense and takes concentration to read, but I enjoyed it and was drawn into the characters' lives. They are not boring or simple in any way, you can like them or not, depending on the way you look at them. It is one of my very favorite books and the musical is my favorite of all time. If you aren't up for the 1,000+ page novel, go see the musical. But I highly recommend the book. It was long, but I hardly noticed.
