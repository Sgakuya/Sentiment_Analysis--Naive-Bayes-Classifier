This is a very innocent strip starring a not so innocent red fox girl and her friend, a philosophical gray fox boy. Ozy and Millie is what you'd get if you mixed Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes, Doonesbury and Bloom County in a blender. The strip never fails to entertain and enlighten (usually at the same time).
