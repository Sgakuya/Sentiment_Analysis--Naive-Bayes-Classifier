Ms. Fontaine is one the the screens great actresses and beauties. Her heartwrenching portrayals in Rebecca, Letter from an Unknown Woman, Constant Nymph, Jane Eyre, and Suspicion are unforgettable. Though thought of as a dramatic actress, her comedic roles were so appealing and she had quite a flair for comedy, e.i. The Affairs of Susan, The Women, and You Gotta Stay Happy. Even Casanova's Big Night is more enjoyable because of her talents.
