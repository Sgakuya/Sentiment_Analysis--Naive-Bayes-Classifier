i never thought that such a small addition to acting such as raising of eyebrows would manage to hoist an actor to the top of my list (AHX)? if you havent seen them; american history x, fight club, primal fear, rounders, keeping the faith, and even everyone says i love you despite its being insanely corny, are all films i would highly reccomend these great films to anyone.
