She has no diversity in her acting roles. She always plays the exact same type of girl, only with a different name. I do think her huge boobs are real, but she is too skinny so she looks too top-heavy...she needs a little more weight to balance things out. She is really not all that and a bag of potato chips. And I lost much respect for her when she dated that queerbait Carson Gay-ly.
