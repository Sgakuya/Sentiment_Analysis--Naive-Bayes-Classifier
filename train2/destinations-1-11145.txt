I have only been here once, and it was not an enjoyable experience. I had been standing in line, drunk, waiting to get into the Georgetown University pub, when someone had the bright idea to roadtrip to Virginia Beach. Next thing we know, it's 6AM and we are at Virginia Beach. It is raining, and cold, everything is closed, and we all had transitioned from being happily drunk, to being brutally hungover. And that was my VA beach experience.
