What is up with this? I guess the idea of it is cool, perfomance wise it is probably the best SUV. But who really needs this capability if they are not in the military, or living on top of a mountain. Doesn't even make any sense to see them on the street. It is clearly a status symbol for people who use it as their vehicle for going to and from work etc...
