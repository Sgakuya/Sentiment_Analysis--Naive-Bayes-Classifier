I saw her on friends, and she's really good in that role. But then I saw her movies. She's a one dimensional kind of an actress. Other than friends I think the only reason she is known at all is because she married Brad Pitt. One thing that puzzles me is what's with the nose? Sometimes (or at some angles) it's perfect, and at others she looks like a camel. She could gain some weight too.
