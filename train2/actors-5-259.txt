Great British actor. I first saw him in "The Third Man." I am a Graham Greene fan and that helped. He played Bligh in the 1962 "Mutiny on the Bounty." I like him with Sinatra in "Von Ryan's Express." I thought he was great in "Ryan's Daughter." but the movie wasn't that hot. One of my favorites is his portrayal as the abbott in "Catholics" (renamed "Conflict.") Watch him in the great WWII caper flick with Gregory Peck and Roger Moore, "The Sea Wolves." Where is his kind today?
