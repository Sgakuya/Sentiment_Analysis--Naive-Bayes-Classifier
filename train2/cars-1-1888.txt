RUN RUN RUN!!! It was just one thing breaking after another. The warranty is the only good aspect and they suckered me in with it's attractiveness. The Elantra is very poorly built and built with cheap, unreliable parts. Steer clear and BUY AMERICAN!!!! Update: Traded for a brand new black Chrylser PT Cruiser.
