An excellent actress, she has charm and grace that isn't known today. Most of her movies are timeless, I could watch them again and again. She's far, far better than Judy Garland and I would saw on an equal billing with Bette Davis at least! She could act circles around anyone in Hollywood today-they don't even compare.
