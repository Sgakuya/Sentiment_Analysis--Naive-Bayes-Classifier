While she may be the current It girl these days, she has done nothing to impress me. A former child star, she is the reigning teen queen at the box office. Her movies, all cutesy and Disney-fied, have made good money but as far as acting talent goes, she's a hack. She's stilted and has the emotional depth of cardboard. One of the worst actresses around these days.
