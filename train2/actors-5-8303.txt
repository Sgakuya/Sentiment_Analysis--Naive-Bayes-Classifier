Vivien Leigh is another one of my favorite actresses. I adored her in Gone with the Wind and it is my all time favorite movie. No other person could have been Scarlet O'Hara. Another one of her great performances was in A Streetcar Named Desire which I thoroughly enjoyed. Her acting was unmatched and she made me weep with pain. Not that many actresses/actors have made me feel the pain they are expressing through their characters quite like her. As far as beauty, she was gorgeous and had such a natural beauty. May her greatness be remembered forever.
