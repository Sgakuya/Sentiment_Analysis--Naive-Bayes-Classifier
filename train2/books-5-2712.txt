An amazing book with more insight and logic than I have seen in a while. The chapters on Faith just blew my mind and I challenge any unbeliever to read that book.... Enikdu, well, an accusation must be supported with evidence, out of curiosity, what fallacies were there and why are they legitimate fallacies (please don't provide speculated fallacies)?
