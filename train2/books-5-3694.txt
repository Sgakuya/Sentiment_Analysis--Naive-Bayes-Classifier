The Brothers Karamazov is my absolute favorite book of all time. The story is so emotionally engaging and spiritually charged that it actually moved me to tears. Dostoevsky creates extremely deep, three dimensional characters in this extremely entertaining and intellectually stimulating masterpiece of existential crisis.
