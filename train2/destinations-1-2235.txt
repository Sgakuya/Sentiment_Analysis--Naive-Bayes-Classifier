What a place. A former exporter of food, this country has been converted to a disaster by the racist Mugabe who has evicted many white farmers from the land they bought or were born on. The same sanctions that applied to Sth Africa during apartheid should apply here. Since even the residents are feeing in droves I can't see why anyone would want to visit the place.
