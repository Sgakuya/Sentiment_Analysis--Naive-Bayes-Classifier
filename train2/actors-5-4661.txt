Jim Carrey is the greatest actor who ever lived! I am also a great fan of Andy Kauffman and Carrey played Andy better than Andy played Andy. Since Kauffmans death I beleave Jim was sent here to replace him. Way to go Jim keep up the funny work. And by the way Only Jim carrey can talk out of his butt and make it tastefull.
