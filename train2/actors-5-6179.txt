I'm not a teenager, not so young ither I was born in the same year Crispin Glover born 1964. So I fallow his career for years, probadly since he start in the business. I love Crispin and all his work, this man is a genius. He's all except ordinary (He's extraordinary). His work make us to think, to try understand the human nature. People try him like a weirdo, but that people did't stop to see, read, analize his work. It's to easy judge, to hard accept we're wrong if we don't know all the facts. David Jordan said: The world steps aside to let any man pass , if he knows where he is going. So Crispin keep going...
