This Harry Potter book is great! I can't wait for the movie. I just want to tell anyone who thinks this book is bad because of the witchcraft aspects, for starters witchcraft is not evil. We don't worship the devil. The devil is a christian deity. How can we worship something we don't believe in. I think that everyone should learn the truth about witches, before they spoke their closed minds.
