I love Freddie Prinze Jr. not only because he is possibly the hottest actor currently in existence(except Brad Pitt) but he is also a really good actor. I have seen almost all of his movies and he has the capabilities to be a comedic actor and a serious actor. He is amazing and a kind person off-screen. I think that he and Sarah Michelle Gellar are good for each other and I wish them the best of luck! And Freddie is HOTTTTT!!! Love ya! bye!
