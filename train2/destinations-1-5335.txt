Pennsylvania is about as close to an 'average' state as you will find anywhere in the US: a mix of rural/urban, eastern/midwestern, average in wealth, a large population but in steady decline, nice scenery but nothing spectacular, etc., etc.... It is insane to see PA ranked between California and New York. Reality Check: PA Pros-Nice scenery. Decent amenities (food, outdoor activities). Pennsylvania Cons-Crappy roads; backward, clannish people outside Philly; nasty slums in Philly, a dull city with some nice spots; nasty old industrial towns literally rusting away; overall PA scenery inferior to New England, Mountain South, Colorado, West Coast; the cost of living is surprisingly high. There must be some kind of wastebasket shortage in PA, because you see more trash lying in the streets and the sides of the roads than anywhere oustide NYC! Not the worst state in the US, but certainly not #5.
