One of the greatest actors, living or dead. Can play virtually any role, and can convey any emotion with a flick of the eyes. Mostly plays villains, but is outstanding at all character types. My favourite Gary Oldman scene is in Immortal Beloved, when he is standing on stage watching the orchestra play his Ninth Symphony, unable to hear them or the audience. He expresses more joy and sorrow in five wordless minutes than most actors do throughout their entire career. He was so good in the Scarlet Letter that he made Demi Moore look talented through sheer proximity.
