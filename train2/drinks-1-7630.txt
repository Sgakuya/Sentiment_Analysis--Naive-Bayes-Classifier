It's scary to think that this is not actually the worst vodka that I have ever tasted. If you go far enough into western mass. you can actually find Poland Springs vodka (yes, they make vodka), the foulest stuff on earth... but I digress. Mr. Boston's is best utilized when your cheap friends send you to the liquor store to resupply a hopping party quickly running dry. Don't try giving this stuff to sober people, it's barely fit to qualify as a jungle-juice additive... oh, what I am kidding myself, anything is fit for jungle juice. If your taste receptors are actually still firing correctly, no freezer is cold enough to make this stuff drinkable.
