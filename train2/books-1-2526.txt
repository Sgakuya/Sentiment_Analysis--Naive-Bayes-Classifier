Maybe the worst comic strip of all time. Rex Morgan is funnier. Every strip seems to go like this I'm supposed to go out on a date with Kevin, but I haven't updated my PDA yet and if I don't do that, my computer won't be synched up with my sidekick and I won't be able to retrieve my phone list for my cell phone which has the number for Kevin. But then I have nothing to wear because I gained 79 pounds and my ass got real fat so i should just go to the gym and work out but I got to get up to brief my boss and I don't want to be too tired for that so maybe I'll just stay home and eat 3 Swanson Hungry man dinners and a 3-pound Whitman sampler that my mother got me for my birthday, but I haven't sent a thank you card to mom yet so i should call her but I still need to update my cell phone list and I really don't care to date Kevin because I am a freakin' psycho lesbian who should have committed suicide 20 years ago.
