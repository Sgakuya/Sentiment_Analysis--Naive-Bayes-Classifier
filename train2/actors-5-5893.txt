First off, Penn's appearance on this list is intended for rating him as an actor, and not for his political beliefs or statements. By strictly acting standards he is simply one of the best, if not the best, actors of his generation. Perhaps the only actor who is as good, and comparable in age, IMO, is Gary Oldman, but that's a whole different debate. Excellent work in everything from "Fast Times" to "Mystic River," an actor with a broad range, and a fine director, his films "The Indian Runner" and the one he made with Nicholson about a serial killer, the name eludes me at the moment, were highly underrated. A reviewer below noted that Penn looks like a scumbag, well, he does, but he and Robbins nailed the spirit of the characters who inhabit working class Boston in a way that is maybe equalled only by Boyle and Mitchum in "The Friends of Eddie Coyle." Are there actors who open their mouth about things they don't fully understand? You bet, but Penn is just as entitled to his opinion as everyone else. And while there is, of course, some merit to complaints about limousine liberals and pampered stars, I find it utterly hypocritical and absolutely hilarious that many of the same people who moan about Penn and other celebrities, or criticize Kerry, Rockefeller, and other politicians of the opposing party, or any other parties, or anyone, of privilege and ivory tower condescension, are the first to be hoodwinked or self-deceived into thinking that their hero Bush is some sort of spokesman for, or pal of, the average guy, or not a member of the blueblood elite of this land with aristocratic roots, and not someone with illustrious, powerful, and incredibly wealthy ancestry.
