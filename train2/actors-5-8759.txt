Jennifer Garner is the most talented actress on television. She's the star of Alias, an awesome spy drama which air Sundays at 9PM on ABC. Her character, you just feel the passion she puts into the role. It's amazing! I can't wait to see her 13 going on 30 movie. She's beautiful, talented, and is the best! GO JEN!!!
