This is a sports car??? This is a 2 door sedan with front wheel drive??? How does this equate to a sports car? Oh I'm sure the 6 speed manual trans helps it to qualify as a sports car. Then again things are all relative. To a Toylet fan maybe this is a sports car especially when compared to other toylets. Real Sports Cars = Corvette, Mazda Miata, Viper, Honda 2000 etc. Get the picture???
