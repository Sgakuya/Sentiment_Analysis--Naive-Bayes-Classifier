The best word I can think of for John Malkovich is fascinating . He gets my undivided attention every time. He was the best Jekyl Hyde I've ever seen (Mary Reilly); and unbelievably adorable in Making Mr. Right. (Gotta love a movie he has two roles in). Easy to love, easy to hate; always brilliant. Places in the Heart, ConAir, and Dangerous Liasons are some of my favorite movies. I find it strange that he can have such disdain for movies and yet be so good in them.
