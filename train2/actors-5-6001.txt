I've been looking over the comments about Tom that said he's a bad actor. You people are unbelievable. The guy is amazing. He's the most intense actor I've ever watched on screen. And for those of you who think he's got a big ego or whatever let me tell you you couldn't be farther from the truth. Having worked at an airport around LA I've met him a couple times and he's as nice as can be. Much nicer than the rest of LA that's for sure!
