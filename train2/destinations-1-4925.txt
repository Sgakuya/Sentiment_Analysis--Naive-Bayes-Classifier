The worst, an absolute dump of a city. Always cloudy, polluted, and depressing. I have been all over Latin America, and this is one of the few places I couldn't stand. Plus, be prepared to get brutally sick - even if you have a stomach of iron. The only bearable place in this festering hole is the Miraflores district.
