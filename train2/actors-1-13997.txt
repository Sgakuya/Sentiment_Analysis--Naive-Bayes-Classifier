I reaaaalllyyy don't like Julia Roberts. She can take what could possibly be a halfway decent movie and turn it into something I would refuse to see or if forced by association to sit through it, leave me longing for the two hours or so of my life gone by. I'd rather be sleeping that have to watch her on film. She has just slightly above zero acting ability. Her extensive repertoire consists of one character..the beautiful (not), wimpering, in need of a hand up, girl whose never gotten a fair shake but is true blue inside and is waiting to do good if only she could get out from under some guy or thing that's been holding her down. Insert helping hand in the form of older man and voila!! you have a yet another piece of crap movie.
