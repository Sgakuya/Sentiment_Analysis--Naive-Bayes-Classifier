Look at some of the ridiculous comments left by conservative people here. "A liar and a traitor. In better times, he'd have been hanged." "Moore ripped the title from Ray Bradbury without even consulting him. Bradbury is outraged." "911 is obvilusly Moore's weight in kilograms" To the idiots who complain about him "cleverly editing" his movie to make a point, of course hes going to do that. Hes a liberal with an agenda, to make conservatives seem like fools and crooks. To believe in a movie or person wholeheartedly is just plain stupid...you have to take everything with a grain of salt. I watched his 9-11 "documentary" and I know its far from the truth, but its entertaining for me to watch republicans be portrayed the way I already viewed them.
