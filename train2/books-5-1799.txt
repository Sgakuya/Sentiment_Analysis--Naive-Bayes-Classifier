For Better or for Worse has got it all: funny but never tries too hard, affecting but never schmaltzy, engrossing but never too much of a reach. The only continuous story line comic I even try to enjoy (I mean, cmon, Mary Worth?). Johnston has a sure touch with difficult story lines (for example the twin problems of growing up and growing old), sugaring them with affection and understanding. That she manages to extract comedy, albeit whimsical, from many of them is a tribute to her intelligence and perceptiveness. Nothing except excellence in this strip.
