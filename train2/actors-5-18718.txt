Tim Burton was the director of one of my all-time favorite movies (Edward Scissorhands - where is it on your lsit, RIA?) and if nothign else, his films are always entertaining, thought-provking, and bizarre. Even that atrocity The Nightmare Before Christmas was strange and original enough to have some value. I'd like to see more of him.
