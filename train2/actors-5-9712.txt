I always thought Reese Witherspoon was a pleasant, charming actress. She shined in Election, Legally Blonde and a few romantic comedies, proving she was quick with material and very likeable. But now with an Oscar nod, people are more and more noticing the depth she can really have if she chooses. The immersion into June Carter Cash was unmistakable; she was a perfect fit to Phoenix's Cash. She has the uncanny ability to be very raw and become her characters- an earlier work of hers,"Freeway" is a prime example. When I saw the young, pretty girl next door become a junkie delinquent, I knew she had the grit and ability to really be something. As much as I loved her happy, comedic flicks, I'm even happier that "Walk the Line" really showed her true potential. The Oscar nomination is totally deserved.
