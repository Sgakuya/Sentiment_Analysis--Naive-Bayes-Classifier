Bruce Willis makes a fool of himself in pretty much every movie that he's in. Moonlighting he always seemed like he was drunk in. Die Hard was a good movie, but he was a mental case in it. Armageddon is one of the worst outer space movies I've ever seen, I'd rather watch It Came From Outer Space. The Sixth Sense, the little boy stole the show, and left Bruce in the cold. The Kid, Lily Tomlin had to do herself, as he made a worse fool of himself then Jim Carrey did in Liar, Liar.
