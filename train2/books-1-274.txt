I haven't read this book, but I want to leave a comment about the whole Diana thing. Yes, her death was very tragic. And yes, it was horrible that her two sons had their mother taken away like that. But can she now rest in peace? I don't think her sons want all of this media attention still focused on her - and now them. Members of her staff have gone on trial and thats kicked off the whole thing again. Let her go and let her family get on with their lives. No one will forget Diana, but surely nit picking her life in books such as this and many others is not the way to keep the memory of her alive.
