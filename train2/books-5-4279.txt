It amazes me that a humanitarian and author such as Wiesel was able to explain Shoah in this compact but evocative masterpiece of survival, second by second, in the Nazi concentration camps, through an eternal Night. William Saroyan evokes similar feelings in his novel The Human Comedy about feelings of loss and despair, but ultimately of hope and redemption of humanity, only Saroyan refers to the Armenian Holocaust. A must-read for those who need to know and be aware of the horrors man can inflict upon man.
