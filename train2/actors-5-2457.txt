I try to see every movie that Samuel L. Jackson is in. I am never disappointed in his performance. He cannot get along on his looks alone, so he is very convincing in the roles he plays. He is very hardworking and professional. He choses his roles well and is only in top quality pictures. He has so much range as an actor he can go from the Die Hard With A Vengeance style of picture to dramas like Fresh, The Red Violin or The Negotiator.One of the best actor/movie stars out there. Still I think this man is one of the most underrated actors in the entire moviemaking industry.
