Their customer service is horrid! I called customer service three times to change my rate plan, because I knew my usage would be going up. Each time I'd call back after receiving a two hundred dollar bill for overage in minutes, and they'd say I'd never called, however they'd see where changes were made to my record and not implemented. )#(*_)(* I moved down the street recently, now I cant even get a signal in my house. Same type of building, less than three hundred feet from the old location. Decided to cancel service, after they'd asked for $170 to upgrade my phone to one with a stronger antenna. BS It took me one visit to a local store and three phone calls to their customer service to finally get a verification my service will be cancelled on August 16th. I'm not holding my breath...their Information Systems Infrastructure either sucks by design or utter incompetance...half the staff I'd talked with doesn't even speak intelligable english.
