Washington is a state of great natural beauty. The thing that kills me about this place is that the population is very, very xenophobic. I have lived here for 6 years, and in different parts of teh state; Port Angeles near the Olympic National Forest, Spokane, and Tacoma. As much as these people seem to think that the western and eastern halves have irreconcilable differences, they do have one trait in common; an intense dislike of outsiders. Washingtonians come in three flavors: Redneck lumberjacks on the peninsula who dont want to talk to you because you are not originally from washington state, Seattle Area Snobs who wont talk to you for the same reason, and Eastern Washingtonians who dont like you because you don't go to the right kind of church in addition to not being from Washington. They find out very quickly if you are not local. A horde of out of state people moved here in the 90's because it was the cool thing to do (me included), and now the locals must find out if you are one of them. They will ask you where you went to highschool. This is a common question anywhere, but in WA state it is of supreme importance. An incorrect answer, which is any answer indicating you are not originally from Washington, will garner you the quickest social rebuff you have ever experienced. On some occasions, this has manifested itself as open rudeness. Washingtonians don't travel much outside of their state, and are wholly ignorant of the rest of the USA; they think the rest of us are chair throwing hicks like they see on Jerry Springer. Dont ever, ever try to move here. You will cry angry hot tears and gnash your teeth until you go back home.
