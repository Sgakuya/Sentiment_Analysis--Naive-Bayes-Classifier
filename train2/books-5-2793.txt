A superb history of Hitler and the Third Reich, movingly written. The chapters covering the period from the founding of the Nazi party to its consolidation of power (all of which occured in a DEMOCRACY) are particularly important. Was Nazism merely an aberration, or can something like this happen again? This book is a warning to us all... and it is also a very, very good read.
