A classic. Some of the best parts of this book, in my opinion, are Churchill's small observations, which he makes on topics as diverse as Stalin and water faucets (he thought it was great when he first saw a bathroom sink that had the hot and cold water run into one stream, so you could control the temperature, instead of running from two separate streams). This book truly gives you an appreciation for how bleak thinkgs looked for England from 1939-1941. Churchill changed the course of the modern world, and this book gives you great insights into his thought process.
