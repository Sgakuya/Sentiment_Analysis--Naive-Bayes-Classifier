I admit I have been pretty rough on no talent pretty boys so far, but of all of them, Freddie Prinze is probably the worst. Unlike most of them, he seems like he's probably an alright guy offscreen, maybe even a little self-deprecating because of the way he carries himself, but he cannot deliver lines to save his soul. He's the male Julia Stiles - probably cool in real life but should never have gone into acting, the only profession where incompetence will not get you fired.
