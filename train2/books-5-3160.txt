some horror books/movies are simply 'gross' movies, but this is a true scary read...it is much better than the movie (as usual)...i read when originally published before the 'horror novel' genre came into being, and it definitely rates right at the top.....it is not contrived, and is certainly a plausible story (except maybe when her head does a 360...)
