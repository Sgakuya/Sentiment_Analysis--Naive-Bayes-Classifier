I'm currently reading 'Crime Punishment' for the first time. I think the plot is very well executed, but sometimes there is a bit of an information overload and it can be tricky to keep up with whose who and what the hell is going on. But it is definately worth reading and I think I'll be reading it again so everything can sink in!
