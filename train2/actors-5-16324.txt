I was a huge fan of General Hospital in the 80's with Luke Laura. I just started watching it again about a month ago. I have been totally addicted to Maurice Benard/Sonny Corinthos. I cannot watch him enough. I find myself watching all the showings of General Hospital on the Soapnet channel just to see him over and over. He is just such an amazing actor, not only with the way he delivers his dialogue, but with his body gestures and facial expressions. My husband even watches it, and the only character he likes is Sonny.
