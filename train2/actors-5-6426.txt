are you kidding me! he deserves a million stars!!!!!I actually adore that guy, but everybody who searched this site does...so i guess he is quite popular. i have seen 4 times the movie the skulls and i am obsessed with him. i live in italy and there dawson's creek is way behind so i haven't even seen pacey and joey get together yet!!!! oh well! i will because otherwise.....I'm going to get crazy, if i,m not already. anyways my biggest dream is to become an actress...and who knows...maybe one day i,m going to do a movie with him. i think that the role in dawson's creek changes a lot my impression of him. when first started this serial i didn't like his caracter because he was so rude and selfish.. so i think that this whole joshua jackson crush for me started when andy came in and he became so wonderfull....now I like him whatever role he plays!!!!!!
