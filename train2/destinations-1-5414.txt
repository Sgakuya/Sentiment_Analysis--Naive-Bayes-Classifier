I have the misfortune of being stuck in Southern Illinois right now but I am going to run away from this place like a bat with it's a$$ on fire as soon as possible. This place is a god awful garbage dump with lots of junk trailers and dumpy houses with one car in the yard that works and three that don't. Popular fashions here are the mullet, the Ku Klux Klan look ( skinned or shaved head), camouflage clothing ( even when not going hunting), baseball caps, and beards that have not been trimmed in months. We have the ugliest guys and some very, very butt ugly women who can't even wear anything that matches and weigh 300 and 400 lbs and insist on showing off their bodies by wearing tight clothing and halter tops. The people here are a bunch of weirdos who have no knowledge of the outside world and won't even talk to you if you happen to be an outsider or evn slightly different than themselves. People here are toothless, ignorant,inbred, smelly, unbathed, unkept nasty pigs. They are not friendly at all, either. They stare at you and won't even say hello. As far as entertainment if you don't like to get drunk, camp, hunt, or fish you will die of boredom here. There is no variety, diversity, education, decent paying jobs, public transportation, NO good health care, and if you visit be sure to rewind your watch about 50 or 60 years!
