Sprint is a piece of crap! Their customer service is next to non-existent. Their coverage looks good on paper....but becomes a whole new ball game if you travel around the country. Their phones (I've tried 5 different models) are worthless with frequent breakdowns. I was with Sprint for over 5-years, and it was five years of uneccessary head-f**ks! Give me Verizon any day of the week.
