The most interesting thing about The Stand is King's ability to develop main characters. There are approximately twenty main characters in the novel, yet I did not have any problem distinguishing them. I felt like I really knew the characters as real people. It was also good how King does not have a complete conclusion. It is left to the reader to make up the ending.
