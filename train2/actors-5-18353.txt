Billy Wilder knew how to make a movie that drew you right in and held you to the finish. When I watch his movies it's not like I'm just watching a movie, it's almost like I'm a part of it. My favorite Wilder movies are The Apartment (1960), The Lost Weekend (1945), Stalag 17 (1953), Some Like It Hot (1959) and The Seven Year Itch (1955).
