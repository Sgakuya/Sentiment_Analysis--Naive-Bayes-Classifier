Bank One is just simpley pathetic. They don't give a damn about the customer, as so many here have said. I transferred most of my CC debt to their low rate card... boy what a mistake. I made sure my payments were on time so the rate wouldn't go up, but once the low rate period was up, it went to 8%, then a few months later, up to 30%. This entire industry is out of hand, and Bank One is the leader. Never again... I don't understand how the CEO sleeps at night. Write your congressman.
