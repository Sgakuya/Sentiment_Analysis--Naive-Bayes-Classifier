I wouldn't recommend Elon unless you have no creativity and you enjoy being a follower. Leo Lambert goes out of his way to make sure you won't have fun. It's a pretty school and it's real easy. Job placement after graduation is impossible and they aren't very helpful at finding jobs. Elon supresses who you are rather than letting you find yourself.
