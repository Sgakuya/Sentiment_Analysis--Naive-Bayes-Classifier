ANGELA BASSETT IS ONE OF THE BEST BLACK ACTRESSES AROUND TODAY. SHE IS A VERY HARD WORKER AND VERY UNDERRATED. SHE IS IF I MUST SAY A GREAT ROLE MODEL FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT PLAY DEMORALIZING CHARACTERS AND ROLES AND YOU NEVER HEAR NEGATIVE NEWS ABOUT HER PERSONAL LIFE WITH HER HUSBAND IN THE MEDIA UNLIKE SOME BLACK ACTRESSES WE KNOW. BUT ANGELA HAS A BEAUTIFUL SPIRIT OF GOD HER MORAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS ARE VERY RE-DEFINED. I COMMEND HER HIGHLY FOR TURNING DOWN MONSTERS BALLS AND SHE WAS ABLE TO GIVE A MORAL AND ETHICAL REASON WITHOUT TRYING TO PUT ANYONE ELSE DOWN KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU FOREVER MORE.
