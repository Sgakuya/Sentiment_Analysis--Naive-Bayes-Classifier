CCB sucks to the fullest extent, I have heard so many people complain about them. They let charges go through on my account even though I told them not to because of a situation of a company fraudulenty (spelling?) withdrawing money from my account. They not only gave these idiots my money but then charged me up the whazoo in over draft fees. I can't even open up another checking account because of them. I now owe over $300 in fees that I have to pay off in order to clear my name and be able to open up an account at another bank. I also got charged fees for walking into their bank to deposit a check, this was under their free checking program. If you do any banking inside their bank or through the drive up, they will charge you a fee. Well, how else was I supposed to deposit my check, considering that 90% of the time their ATM machine wasn't working. What ever you do don't open an account with them. The free gift is not worth it.
