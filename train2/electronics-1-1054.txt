I hate Cell Phones because these stupid high school and college girls and boys yak on them all the time, run up huge bills, and end up going to Judge Judy because the people who brought the the cell phones often end up having to pay the cell phone bills themselves because these stupid kids can't pay them. Nokias are very popular among these irresponsible high school and college kids.
