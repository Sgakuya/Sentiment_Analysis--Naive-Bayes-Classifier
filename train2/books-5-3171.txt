Of the many, many, many Koontz books out there, this is far and away the best of the lot. Not only is it one of the few that doesn't seem formulaic (sp?), it also tells the best story. From the first few pages to the last few words, you will hang on every sentence, and wonder what happens next. The same can not, unfortunately, be said for a lot of other Koontz books. If you read nothing else the man has written, pick this book up!
