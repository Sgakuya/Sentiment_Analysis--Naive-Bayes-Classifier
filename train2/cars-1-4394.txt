Another Ford money-pit. Bought a 1999 LX with 22K on it. Ran real well for about 3 years, then everything began to die at once. Engine light kept coming on at 74K. Two O2 sensors and air deflector replacement didn't help (around $350 total). Engine began surging after cold startup. Power steering rack blew at 79K, cost $650 to replace. Tie rods had to be replaced. Heater quit working, loud slapping/banging noise from under dash that we couldn't get rid of. Then, our mechanic says, Head gasket is going out, get rid of it. Owned a '91 Taurus money-pit and another Windstar previously. I finally learned my lesson. No more Fords.
