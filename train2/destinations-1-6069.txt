This state rates 49th out of 50 states for the 'intelligence' of its populace. Well there is some validity to this, believe me. Las Vegas is a dry overpriced plastic ersatz mecca of nothingness. Reno is not much better- and Carson City is a sorry dump- Tahoe is beautiful- but hardly redeems the remainder of this sorry state. Filled with deserts, poison from past nuclear testing, snakes and scorpions. And the water will soon run out- take your chances at the roulette wheel.
