He's hilarious! Chandler is my favorite out of the guys on Friends. He's so talented. It's too bad about his drug addiction and his accidents, but hey, s**t happens to everybody. No one could play Chandler as good. Chandler and Joey make the best pair. That's where most of the humor is on that show. I think Chandler is the backbone of Friends. He brings most of the humor to it. If he wasn't so funny, and didn't tell such good jokes, I think the show would be boring.
