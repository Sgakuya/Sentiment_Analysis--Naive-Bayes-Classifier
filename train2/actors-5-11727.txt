Gotta love her-quite aside from the fact she is one of the hottest actresses out there, love the way she appears so genuine and totally dismissive of and untainted by Hollywood BS. Staggeringly, i have heard some small minded types critise her for her adoption ambitions but when you cut through the crap she is giving abandoned children a much better life than they otherwise would have had.
