I think Marky Mark Wahlberg is the one of the finest men in the world. Not only is he a great musician, and no matter what no one thinks he is a great musician, he is also a great, talented actor.I think he can do whatever he wants to do and no one can stop him. He is the best. I love Mark. I wish him good luck.
