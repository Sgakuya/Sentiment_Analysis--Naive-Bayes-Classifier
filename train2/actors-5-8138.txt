Jane Fonda is an inspiration. She doesn't strike me as a particularly shrewd woman...she plays it as it lays...and she knows to lay low when her situation gets too complicated. She's raw, her performances communicate a soul deep sadness without actually 'performing' sadness (see 'They Shoot Horses Don't They?'). Her reputation as 'Hanoi Jane' is the result of more right-wing hyperbole than anything. In short, she's my favorite Christian.
