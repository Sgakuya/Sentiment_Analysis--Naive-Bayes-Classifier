Even now, after all these years, and after countless other handsome faces have come and gone, Cary Grant is still the one Hollywood actor I want to be most like. He knew how to handle the verbal barrages of beautiful women with a smile and a witty comeback, and it seemed as though he ALWAYS got to the woman rather than vice versa. The personification of style and class, he knew the importance of never letting them see him sweat, even while carrying out timeless comedy. I'm sure that as we speak, he's making the angels blush in Heaven.
