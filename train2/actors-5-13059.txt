well, what can I say. At the first glance she is incredibly beautiful, she has a body that'd make most straight guys drool and eyes that just say it all. She's tall, not too thin, blonde and with a killer smile. As an actor she's not incredible but she wins me over with her extremely honest nature. Definately a fan of her and her movies, i hope she continues with a successful career and unfortuanatley a marriage too i suppose, so long cameron...
