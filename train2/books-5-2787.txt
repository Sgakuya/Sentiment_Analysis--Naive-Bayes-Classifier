The Second World War was originally published in 1948 (just three years after the war) in a series of volumes; however, I read the abridged version which was originally published in 1959 and which has the advantage of including Winston Churchill's observations on NATO and the early Cold War era. First and foremost, the books give an in-depth, firsthand perspective of one of the most important events in the 20th Century, the effects of which are still felt in the contemporary world. While Churchill can be excessively detailed at times, his distinctive manner of writing largely overcomes this and many of the details provide an interesting time capsule of the times. The point of view is obviously from a British perspective; however, this is interesting to counter the American perspective given in U.S. schools. For a history book, The Second World War is actually an enjoyable and sometimes easy read (at least the abridged version).
