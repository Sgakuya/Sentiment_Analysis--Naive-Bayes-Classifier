I really loved the way Courteney looked back in Season 1 of Friends, but she still looks incredible now. She's just breathtakingly beautiful, in a way that doesn't always come across on screen for some reason. And what a voice! I've noticed something though - if you take a look at a picture of her before she married David Arquette, she has a certain light behind her eyes that she doesn't have now. She's much too good for him, I'm just totally mystified as to why she's with him at all! Courteney, you're a beautiful woman - find yourself someone who's more your standard!
