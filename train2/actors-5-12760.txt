I just saw the PallBearer with Gwyneth Paltrow and David Schwimmer-- I think she deserves five stars overall because (up until this point) she fooled me: I too thought she could act, but it was just an act (get it?) So she really can't act as in become a character, but she sure can ACT like she can act. Mimicry, long pauses--- ugh! I found it hard to believe her character in the Pallbearer in many of the scenes- it was hard to maintain a connection with her and to feel or care for her other than the weepy look she sometimes portrayed. Especially unbelievable is the part towards the end where she and Schwimmer are standing facing each other outside their friend's wedding reception: and Gwyneth like was totally motionless for like 3 or 4 seconds...it was sort of like something stopped and it was awkaward to watch- but I guess if you are that shallow (as an actress) than there's a bigger tendancy you will think you are having a dramatic pause when actually you've just come to the surfacce and there's no where to go. I kind of feel sorry for her since it's so obvious she can't act and here she is the recipient of an Oscar. I was under the impression that acting was becoming (key word: becoming) a character and then living in that character's world. Some can do it so well you completely forget that it's actually an actor up there. You can see the soul of the person- with Gywneth all you see is her seeing herself. I hope Gwyneth takes the chance and tries to improve her acting, whether by taking a small but meaty role or going to the Actor's Studio... but it may not happen since she's already had success, after honing her acting as an actress skills.
