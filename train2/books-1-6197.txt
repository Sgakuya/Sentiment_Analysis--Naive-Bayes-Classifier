Everyone is biased to one degree or another; newspeople are just like any one of us. It's not just reflected on the tone of a reporter's story, it is also reflected in the stories one reads on the paper or sees on TV. It's impossible for one not to be biased; Goldberg has a point, but it's duly noted. Most rank-and-file reporters are liberal, but for most of them, ideology isn't so much the point as it is getting out a story. A good reporter doesn't show his/her bias, my problem is that most newspeople don't verify their sources. For instance, during the Iraq war, the media would get it's information straight from the Pentagon and the White House without first verifying with other departments like State to check it for accuracy. Turns out that we were reading false news, cooked up to hype up the Iraq threat. There's just a lot of laziness out there on the part of the news media, even worse is the fact that they don't have the guts to stick their heads out and question the status quo for fear of losing credibility with the big shots. An even bigger concern is that quality reporting is being sidelined for a sensationalist brand of journalism. If it bleeds it leads. Terrorist threats always make it to the front page even though that's just a normal threat like any other. We always hear about bloody murders, accidents, jury hearings, and celebrity pop garbage from the media, especially in this country. We just aren't getting the whole story, news is becoming entertainment, thus distorting one's world view. Ideological polarization is part of the flashpoint, two sides arguing out some marginal issue, forgeting about intellectual discourse and moderation. Goldberg highlights only a very small problem within the media; he addresses his book primarily to conservatives.
