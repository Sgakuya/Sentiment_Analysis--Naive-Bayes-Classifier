I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a melon baller than watch Jim Carrey make an ass of himself yet again. It's really getting old and tiresome Jim. Grow up. Slapstick comedy is fine for simple minds but I prefer a little comedic maturity every now and then. What's up with the stupid facial expressions anyway? You look like some sort of a farm animal. Well I guess that's supposed to be funny......how sad.
