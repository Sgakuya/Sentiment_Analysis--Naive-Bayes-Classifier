Katherine is an amazing actress. Despite having a rather difficult (IMO) role in Young Americans, she was able to make the character seem real and easy to relate to. She completley gets into the character, all the way down to the smallest facial expressions. I think she has amazing potential and will have an amazing career. I cna't wait to see her in many other movies/TV shows.
