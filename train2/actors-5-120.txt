Great, great everyman actor with a resume of excellent films. He wasn't leading man handsome but instead always brought a lived in feel to his characters, whether it was tough guy detective Sam Spade, world weary mercinary Rick Blaine or the aging, cynical, but ultimately caring agent in the Barefoot Contessa.
