Bruce is awesome!!!! Who could have been better for the part in the Sixth Sense ?!?!? No one! He does every character that's given to him so well. I loved The Whole Nine Yards , and you also gotta love some of the movies where he's a bad boy. When he cries, you feel loads of empathy towards him. I loved him in The Kid . :-D
