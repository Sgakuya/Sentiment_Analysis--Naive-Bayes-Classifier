One of the best strips of all time. The Fox family is just a typical, normal everyday American Family with a math genius son, a less inteligent daughter and a wanna be jock. The father is a computer illiterate, and the mother just trys to cope with her strange brood. Jason is like me, he goes into projects and ideas full throttle. Brilliant strip.
