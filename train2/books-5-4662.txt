Upton Sinclair's The Jungle is the greatest call to scialism since Marx's communist Manifesto. Tracing Jurgis Ludkis (sp?) through the hell of Chicago's meat industry the reader gains true insight into the like of wage slavery. The disturbing thing about the book is that it got the Clean Foods Act passed but did little for the lives of workers.
