Oh where to begin!! This broad is sooo very overrated and very conceited. I do not find her attractive at all and I'm afraid if she broke a nail, she'd have a complete nervous breakdown. When I hear people call her hot , I cringe. She can't even act in an emotional part of a movie.(NEVER have seen her cry, just blubber). So, I have taken the liberty to nickname her THE FRIGID QUEEN. And I think she shows more nudity in films then she does in real life. Ever wonder if her marriage is consummated?? I highly doubt it!!!! HEY HALLE.....YOU'RE NOT ALL THAT!!!
