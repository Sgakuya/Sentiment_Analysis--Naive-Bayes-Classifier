I like Jack Nicholson and I like a lot of his movies he's in. He's become a legend because of his style and charisma. However their are and have been better actors than him. He's good at he does, but his approach to a role is basically the same. His best role was as Warren Schidmit in About Schmidt because he is actually acting in that movie and it is so different from the real Jack Nicholson. I give him 5 stars because I do like his performances in movies such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Batman, The Shining, As Good As It Gets, Something's Gotta Give and more.
