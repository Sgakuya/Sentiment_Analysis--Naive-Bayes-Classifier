This vehicle's competitors include models from Lexus, BMW, as well as Mercedes. This is a near-luxury vehicle that really is not worth the buy. For $25,000 starting price, a small 4-cylindar engine is standard that makes only 170hp, underwhelming for the class. All its competitors are a much better buy. Prices escalate quickly with just a few options. The rear seat has as much room as a Ford Focus. Fortunately, a new and improved version is expected sometime in 2004 as a 2005 model.
