I love Bruce Willis! I happen to be one of the only females I know who adores action/war movies, and Bruce is perfect for these. He's a very dynamic actor, very flexible in roles and also very believable. After 9/11, he said that he was no longer interested in acting in violent films, but I can't see him in anything else. Besides, Tears of the Sun is coming out this week, and that seems pretty violent to me. . .
