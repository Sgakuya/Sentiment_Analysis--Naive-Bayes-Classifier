Tamara Braun is an amazingly flat out boring actress. No amount of shoving this actress down people's throat is going to make her a leading lady. Her acting is second rate at best and it is painful to watch her three facial expressions. It's a shame that GH insists on using their lesser actresses while more worthwhile actresses flounder on the backburner.
