There is only one car more boring than a Honda Accord and it's a CAMRY!!! Most people who buy these things don't give a hoot about cars. They should just take the subway and be done with it. The Earth would be better place because of it. Come to think of it they are probably tree huggers any way. I'm glad some people buy Honda's and Toyota's - it would be terrible if people all drove good looking exciting cars. Its a balance of nature thing - boring exciting boring exciting.
