If you want a truly enjoyable, legitimate Tennessee style whisky make it George Dickel #12, or nothing. Jack Daniels... it is a damned disgrace that this glorified hooch is somehow the defacto representive American whisky. I can name ten brands off the top of my head that are far superior and cost less. Great marketing, I'll give them that, but nothing more.
