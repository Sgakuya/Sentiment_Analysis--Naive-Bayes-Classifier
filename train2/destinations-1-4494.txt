Prejudice with a capital P! If you've any outward indication that you're a Yankee, you will get into trouble.While I was in the military, I had the misfortune of driving to Atlanta when my Grandmother was dying. Misfortune in her death, but equally in the attitude of the local Atlanta folk who would render all sorts of less that kind actions in my direction. Example: I was on a 6 lane Hwy driving around in the number 4 lane, just about, if not over the speed limit. There were few cars on the road and room to pass on most lanes. I was shouted at, flipped off, cut off and more as a drove this southern HWY. Reason - I had New York Plates.
