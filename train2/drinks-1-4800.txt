BLEAH!! Nasty-tasting stuff. I hate Dr. Pepper. I don't care if it's the oldest pop around, it's disgusting. My brother likes it for some odd reason. He said they put prune juice in it. I guess that's what accounts for the nauseating taste and smell of it. If I had a choice between this and my own urine, I'd drink the urine. Keep it away from me, thank you!
