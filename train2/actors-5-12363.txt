First of all, Halle is so much more than just a pretty face. You people who only care about looks need to dig a little deeper. If you actually listened to Halle you would see that she's a great person with a wonderful personality. And, she is an excellent actress. And it is so disturbing to see all of the racist remarks on this page. For PhillipW who said it's the white in her that makes her so beautiful, black women are beautiful, just as beautiful as white women. Halle is beautiful simply because she's beautiful. It's 2002 and people still have issues with race. That's so sad.
