I have seen many movies with Russell Crowe. He has a presence that is just so unreal. When you see him on the screen, you can tell that he totally emerges his self in the role. That's what makes a movie star good. I have to admit that I don't really find him that attractive. Sometimes he is a looker other times he is not that hot. Oh well, I'd snap him up if I had the chance regardless.
