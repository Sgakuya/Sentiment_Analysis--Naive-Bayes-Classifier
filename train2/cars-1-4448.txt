Purchased this van new from dealer in 1995 for $20,000. Intake gasket blew at 14,000 and engine failed at 42,000. Transmission failed at 80,000 and traded it with 87,000 and recived $5,600 trade in as Ford rebuilt engine with 45,000 miles was starting to knock. Ford's response to my problems convinced me that my business was not appreciated. This is my last Ford.
