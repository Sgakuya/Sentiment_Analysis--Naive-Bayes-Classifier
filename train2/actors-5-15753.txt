Oh boy, S&Cners are beyond pathetic.So unhappy about your reunion,huh? Geeeeeeeze.It's getting beyond ridiculous.Well, if finding any way possible to bash Ted King makes you feel less miserable I'd say go for it.Just shows how childish you're. He is still talented, handsome, and one of the most well-respected actors on GH.
