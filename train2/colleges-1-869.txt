I would NOT recommend University of Phoenix to anyone! Like others have said on here, UOP is really excited to get you enrolled then they really do not seem to care. Then to withdrawl is a whole other story, no help from UOP to make sure you have withdrawn correctly. This school is not student oriented as they claim, all they see are the $$$$$. I wish I had never heard of this school. I attended online and I liked the fact I could do this from home, but I have learned that it depends on the online school, as far as UOP goes their online program stinks! I'm in another online program at another school and let me say WOW what a difference it makes going to a school that acutally care about their students. Once again DO NOT waste your hard earned money on Univeristy of Phoenix because that is exactly what it will be a waste of money!!
