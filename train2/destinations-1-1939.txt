Firstly, United States has a very high crime rate, not forgetting that this country is full of racism. Secondly, people seem to be cocky about them being an American, I dun see whats so great about this country. And furthermore, United States is NOT the wrold's richest country, instead its ranked the 10th. The Country's only strength is only Entertainment, and nothing else. Perhaps I should give a 3 for those innocent Americans as well as the States of New England and Washington I've visited. But sorry, I find this country too overrated and Ill have to give it a 1.
