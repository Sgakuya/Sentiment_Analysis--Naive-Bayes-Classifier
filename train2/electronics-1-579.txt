I did not like it at all. The way the buttons clicked when you pushed them... they made a very annoying noise, and the design turned me off too. I haven't owned one, but from what I saw at Circuit City, I wouldn't suggest it. When you FF between tracks, there's too long of a pause between tracks, and you can also hear it change from track to track, which made this awful mechanical sound.
