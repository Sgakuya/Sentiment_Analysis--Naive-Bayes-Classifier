Our cable and internet is constantly going out and we have to call to get a credit to our account. The cable internet is very slow compared to others, plus they just raised our rates AGAIN.... yet we don't get anything extra out of it. There are no other cable companies in this town to switch to... if we go with Satalite TV we can't get network channels... they've got us where they want us and all we can do is take it in the ass!!
