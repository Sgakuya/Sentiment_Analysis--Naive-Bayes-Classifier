The best american actress alive today. Her performance in SAFE (directed by Todd Haynes) is very much worth taking in as a study in restraint and how an actress lives inside the character she's portraying. Delivers an amusing performance in COOKIE'S FORTUNE, a brief, humorous turn in SHORT CUTS, both films by Robert Altman, and is appearing in the current film THE END OF THE AFFAIR with Ralph Fiennes, directed by Neil Jordan. Also see, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, BOOGIE NIGHTS, and VANYA on 42nd STREET.
