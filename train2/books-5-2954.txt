My favorite novel of all time. The ultimate good vs. evil story with an assortment of remarkable and unforgettable characters. Most of my friends dismiss his writing and say that he writes nothing but junk. I find this funny since they have never read any of his work. If you base his work by the crappy movies made over the years no wonder people think he stinks. They also ignore the fact that he has sold millions books -- one friend had the nerve to say to me, that King does not write anymore. The publishers just put a few ideas in a computer and come up with a variation on his previous books. King is a genius. This story especially gives your insight into every type of character imaginable. I do not want to give a major part of the storyline away but remember the Swine Flu? King tried to warn us! Ok, I will admit that his in-depth descriptions might gross out the faint at heart but believe me it is all vivid to the story. If you read only book by him I strongly recommend this one.
