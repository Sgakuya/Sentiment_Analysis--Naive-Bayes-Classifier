Hartford has yet to pay me for my truck damage when it was stolen. The theft actually happen once the adjuster got the claim. They do not want to pay for my truck even after I sent them ads showing them they were $1000's off on their offer. Nor will they repair it. The loss happen in april 04. Save yourself money and lots of grief and do not buy hartford insurance. They are heartless.
