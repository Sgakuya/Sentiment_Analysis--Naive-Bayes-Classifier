She is a great actress and I hope someday to work with her. I loved Fried Green Tomatoes and the cast was great, I also would love to work with Mary Stuart Masterson. When I lived in Indiana I went to a casting director and she wanted to know why she should be my agent, I told her I was going to be the next Kathy Bates- she became my agent. I live in North Hollywood and work in film and am in school and plan to attend USC to study film and acting. I have been compared to her people say I look like Kathy and that is an honor. Hope someday to work with her. Thank you Becky Ann
