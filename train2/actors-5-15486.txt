Travis handled his role of Spanky in the 1994 version of The Little Rascals quite well. Also, he was one of the young spokesmen on some of the Welch's Juice commericals, one of which he talks about the tongue getting bored after drinking the same thing... the same thing... the same thing. He was born in 1988; it's hard to believe that he's almost a grown man.
