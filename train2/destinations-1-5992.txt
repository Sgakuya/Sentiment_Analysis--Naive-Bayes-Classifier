i personally hate the state of Maryland. I am from Massachusetts and evrey time ive been down there has been a bad expedience. I was stuck there for 12 hours in just traffic because the Maryland Police took that long to pick up a bumper to bumper accident. And balimore looks like a chemical wasteland...it smelled. i was really dissapointed with Maryland
