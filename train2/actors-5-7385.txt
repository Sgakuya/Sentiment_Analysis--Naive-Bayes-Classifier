Politics has nothing to do with this man's acting, which is supurb. It's OK to disagree with the man; in fact, it is your right. However, just because he holds an opposing viewpoint does not make him un-American. In a sense, it makes him a real American for exercising his right of free speech. As I said, his acting is supurb. He was great in Apocalypse Now , and he exhibited his love for JFK by playing him in the TV mini series, Kennedy . He stands behind Bruce Greenwood as the best person to play the role of JFK. However, I thought his portrayal of Kennedy was a bit inaccurate. He portrayed JFK as somewhat of a stuck-up man with no sense of humor. Kennedy was well-known for his sense of humor, publically and privately, and this attribute was missing from Sheen's performance. However, he fared much better than a lot of the other actors who have tried to assume the role of President Kenendy. He went on to impress me in Wall Street , and he did a wonderful job portraying Robert E. Lee in Gettysburg . I loved his performance in The War at Home . That is probably one of my favorite of his films- he and his son Emilio had such a presence in that film, along with Kathey Bates. The mood in that family home reflected the mood of the country as they dealt with the trauma of the Vietnam War. He's great as the President of the United States in The West Wing . O , Spawn and The American President were also great performances from this very talented actor. I care much more about his acting abilities than his political beliefs.
