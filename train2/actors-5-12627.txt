One of the finest dramatic actresses in the world Alfre excels when she is given a role where she can be both tender and tough.Always cast in the role of a complex, multilayered woman of many nuances with Alfre's character you always know where she stands.Blessed with a smoky, self-assured delivery she has within her cache an ironic inflection that is one of her most effective instruments.There are so many of her performances to love but check out the hoop star's mother in Blue Chips or the overburdened mom of four in Crooklyn and really perfect as a 'proper' mentor to Sanaa Lathan in Love n' Basketball all standouts but plenty of fine roles where she isn't a mom.She is Winnie Mandela in Mandela .There are often druggie roles there for her but the best one of those can be found in Down in the Delta where she's allowed to be so much more than the cliches.Ms Woodard has been great a long time and there is Passion Fish , Cross Creek Miss Firecracker , Grand Canyon and the really fine all the way around The Piano Lesson . Miss Firecracker and The Sophisticated Gents find her in good form back in the day.Probably a lot of folks know her from HBO's Miss Evers' Boys but not as many from her cameo as a judge in the hit that launched Edward Norton Primal Fear or in the highly entertaining Brown Sugar .So you've seen her now go back and check out her career.It's been landmark and she hasn't even shown us yet all she can do.
