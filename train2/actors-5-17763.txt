Rebecca Herbst is a terrific actress! I have been watching her since she first came on the show. She has never had a false moment. She always gives 100%. She even made seens with the screaming Jacob Young worth watching! I loved her with Steve Burton and I love her with Greg Vaughn. She's beautiful and she's graceful. She is good to her fans and they obviously love her too.
