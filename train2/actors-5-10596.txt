On screen, Drew Barrymore sparkles like a genuine diamond and she always brings out that quality in her costars as well. She's a natural person (free-spirited and a little goofy) and a natural star! She has an amazing talent for not being too conscious of the camera and doesn't mind making a fool of herself to better certain scenes. Where would so many people be without her? She serves as an inspiration to so many, but to meet her it would seem as if she wouldn't pretend to be anything more or less than a friend.
