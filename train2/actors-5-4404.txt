Jason Isaacs is worthy of every praise given to him. He has stressed himself that he is not a 'star', nor does he wish to be. He is purely a character actor and a damn fine one at that. I can only hope that he continues his wonderful performances and gains the notoriety due him. He is incredibly talented and well-versed in everything he's portrayed to date. He has made a dedicated fan out of me forever!
