Based on Han Solo and Indiana Jones alone, Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors. So even without considering his great performances in movies like Blade Runner, Apocalypse Now, Witness, Patriot Games, Fugitive, Clear and Present Danger, and Air Force One, I'd give Harrison Ford a 5-star rating. But don't let me get carried away - he definitely has limits. I don't think he's all that great in romantic comedies (Working Girl, Sabrina) or when he stretches his typical character too much - like when he played the mentally challenged guy in Regarding Henry. But he's perfect for the regular-guy action hero roles, like the Jack Ryan character in all the Tom Clancy movies.
