So far, from reading these ratings, I've learned that she survived cancer, there's a drink named after her, and, some people wish she was their daughter. I remember when Cindy Brady hated her because she couldn't be her, and, of course, I remember most of her movies. Her acting ability was awesome, especially for her time, when there was not as much in special effects and other technology available. If she was a child actor today, I would still love her. The thing I remember the most is her dancing...she was so good that they put her right beside the best dancers in history!
