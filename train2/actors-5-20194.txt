Courteney Cox Arquette is the BEST ever! *(as you can see from my Screen name thing)*! She is sooo pretty with short straight hair, and short long hair. I LOVE her in seasons 3-7 of FRIENDS. Although she wasn't THAT pretty in season's 1-3, she still was(and is) the best! I wish i could see R rated movies, and i wasn't scared out of my witts of scary movies, so I can see scream 1,2 and 3. I hope she is not pregnant (yet)! She is too beautiful too put on weight! P.S. She is much better than Jennifer Aniston!
