After I first saw her in Foxfire where she tattoos herself with a big sewing needle, I had to try this, but it didnt work too good, so I used a razor blade...i would let her cut me all over, we would be blood sisters ...we already share the same birthday, crazy gemini twins...stop screwing around with blokes, angie, you need a grrl, or at least a cat...how about a futuristic foxfire sequel where she plays the one-eyed leader of a band of lesbian stormtroopers...
