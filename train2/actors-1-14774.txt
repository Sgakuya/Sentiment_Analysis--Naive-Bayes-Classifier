When J.Lo's career started to skyrocket I thought it was wonderful to see a Latina woman taking the entertainment industry by storm, opening the door for other Latinos entertainers who are extremely underrepresented in Hollywood. I forgave all the jelly shaking and unecessary booty shots because hey, in the beginning it's all about attracting attention and getting noticed. But now that she is one of the most powerful women in Hollywood, what does she do with that power? She takes the role of a maid and poses for billboard photos sitting next to a bucket and mop dreaming of her white prince charming to rescue her. When are latina women finally going to escape these tedious houseservant and sexpot stereotypes? Kudos to Selma Hayek for using her star status to produce a movie like Frida. J.Lo should follow suit.
