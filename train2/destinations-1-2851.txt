A dump! I live here, the people are rude it's dirty there isn't anything much to do. All the truly forward thinking and bright people leave (i'm working on that) Thats why the City Gov.is so awful. It's as backwards as the rest of the state. If it wasn't for the Eagles,Flyers and 6ers there would be NOTHING here that anyone would care about. Note how I didn't add the Phillies, Don't come see to see the Bell it has a crack in it and is out for repair
