Ingo is a dynamic gorgeous guy who brings a zest for life and charm to the character of Jasper Jax. He needs a love interest that is compatible with who the character is, not an actress who's chararacter is known for being evil. Ingo's subtle acting is superb and never over the top. He is a joy to watch.
