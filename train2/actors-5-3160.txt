I saw Gladiator two days after I broken up with my boyfriend,I was sad and depressed, but he maked me feel happier. People! Do you Know why? It's obvious.. I have only seen 3 films of him but It's enough to conclude that he s one of the best actors.He plays roles that are so convencing and he consumes his characters so well. He s the right combination: great actor and so attractive.
