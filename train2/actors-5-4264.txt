If it was possible to rate John Travolta with ten stars, I would. He is THE actor. And that's not all, he's also an author, pilot, singer and father (at one point, he was voted one of the nicest people in Hollywood). He's had tough times in his career, but he stuck with it. He never stopped, and went on to make one of the biggest come backs (if not THE biggest come back) in movie history. I own almost every movie that John Travolta has been in (including the movies he only has a small role in, such as Carrie ). I also collect John Travolta memorobilia...my favorite piece of Travolta memorobilia is a box of Saturday Night Fever trading cards (with the gum still inside) from the late 70's. My favorite Travolta movie is a tie between: Grease, Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction. I love the fact that the character he portrays in each movie is so different from the other (high school student, dancer and hitman). Now that's versatile! He is so charasmatic and not afraid to try anything..that takes a lot of guts. He really deserves credit for making the second attempt at his career...I'm sure many people lost faith in him after the Look Who's taking movies....but he took a chance on Pulp Fiction, and he won...besides that, I heard he received only a six figure salary for Pulp Fiction, and look at him now! I will always be a true Travolta fan!
