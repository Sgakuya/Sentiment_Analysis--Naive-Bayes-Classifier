I think that Meryl is a great versatile actress.she has been good in any role I have seen her done. I liked her in Music from the Heart, Sophie's Choice. I even liked the role she had in a tv movie about a mother trying to get help for her epilectic son in First Do know harm. She is a talented woman.
