The idea of decaf coffee was sullied by this people for years. They took bad coffee and made it poisonous. Pennzoil tastes better. A sorry story of U.S. buyers being goosed. Decaf has been around for decades in Europe but Mrs. Folger and her dummy pals were too lazy to try it. Now the good brands have it and Sanka should slip away into the night like the Edsel and Tiny Tim. It is a national crime that this brand ever got loose!
