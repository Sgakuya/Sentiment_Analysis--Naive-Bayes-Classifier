River Phoenix by far is one of my favorite actors ever. I didn't know of him before or even when he died....just a while ago I discovered his talent. I can't believe he let it all go to waste!! Not only gorgeous was he, but had this immense talent that he could have cultivated into something even greater than it already was! It angers me, that he got involved with drugs and wouldn't let anyone help him. A self inflicted death. It could have, and should have been prevented.
