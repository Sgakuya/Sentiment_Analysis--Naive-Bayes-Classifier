UMMM Let's see where do I start, The fact that they have been supplying Iraq with weapons that are dated 2003? They were so Concerned with us not going into Iraq because they were going to lose millions that Iraq owed them for weapons and mines? Then after war they have enough nerve to try and get us to let them help rebuild Iraq so they can get more money? F@$K Them! They should take every american that died in france During WWII and bring them home to Arlington. Its a disgrace to have them over there in that pathetic SH!T HOLE. Plus their women are smelly and don't shave.
