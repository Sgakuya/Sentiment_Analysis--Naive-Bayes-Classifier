This is the greatest of Dostoyevsky's novels, and probably the best Russian novel ever written. Like Moby Dick, it is incredibly long and ambitious, and manages to cover just about every single philosophical idea that the author ever had. The characters are some of the most well-developed I have ever encountered (as they should be, the novel is over 1000 pages long) and the murder mystery is reasonably suspenseful. It is, however, the psychological analyses of the characters that is the greatest accomplishment. I do not see how someone can proclaim themselves educated without having read Dostoyevsky.
