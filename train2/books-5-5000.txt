Heaney has taken a hoary old Chestnut, and rendered it fresh and new. True, you have to enjoy Beowulf to begin with (which is not an easy read, even in translation... the pacing is very strange to modern sensibilities). Frankly, you either love Beowulf, or you hate it. Heaney has put the _Poetry_ back into Beowulf-- and he's done a really remarkable job of it. The Georgian and Victorian translators never really caught the 'beat' of the thing. Without the alliterative feel, the Poem is dry as dust, and has bored undergraduates for generations; Heaney restores the underlying 'throb'... and has thus restored the feel that those on the mead-benches must have felt. The work is admittedly strange... our sensibilities have changed somewhat over the past millenium. But, if you are brave enough to delve into Beowulf, you won't find a more gripping retelling. Seamus Heaney has offered us as fine and fitting translation as we are likely to hear in this Age. It's not an easy read, even in Modern English... but he's caught not only the sense of the thing, but the underlying feel. And that is remarkable!
