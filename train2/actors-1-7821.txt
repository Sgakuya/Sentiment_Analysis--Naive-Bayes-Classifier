I rarely agree with ALL of my fellow negative reviewers (i.e. one star) through the date of my review (5-01-02), but this is one time I do! I can only add one additional condemnation to their list: My revulsion when they cast Alec Baldwin as the heroic Gen. Doolittle in Pearl Harbor. That anti-American hack Baldwin doesn't deserve to play an American hero.Oh, and for the few reviewers who like this lug, get a life.
