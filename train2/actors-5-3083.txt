Don't forget those early roles - in Proof, Romper Stomper, Hammers over the Anvil, The Crossing, and later The Insider and even A Beautiful Mind. If you have actually SEEN these movies and can then honestly tell me this guy can't act then I'll just take the apples and oranges point of view. I first came to like him early on in the underrated Quick the Dead, and I really wish that he would have remained a character actor and never become a big star. But I guess the journey to major stardom was inevitable for someone with those looks and charisma. A character actor is left alone and kept to a small group of admirers who have a thoughtful appreciation for what he does. They don't know much about his personal life and can only have opinion of him as an actor. So many opinions of Crowe here are of him as a human being. We have no right to judge him as a man, only as an actor. I could say he is a cocky, adulterating boozer who probably doesn't know how good he's got it? Perhaps he is. And if he is that's his problem. A big big problem. But we're rating actors here, not souls.
