i think that steve burton (jason) is the sexiest man alive and if any one cant see that then they should probally have their head examined. i mean where else are you going to find some one who has pretty blue, eyes, great hair, is sweet, honest, doesnt have his head up his ass, is not afraid to take a risk, and has perfect teeth, look at the way the proposed to his wife, i mean how much sweeter can a man get?? he is picture perfect he is the main reason general hospital is good!! (him and sonny) he plays a wonderful, faithful mobster on the show then does comedy, he is perfect!!!!!!
