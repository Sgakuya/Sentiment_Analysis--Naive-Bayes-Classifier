I have had the same problem over and over again, I was just on the phone with a rep and just broke down in tears. I have been out of work for a while from Delta Airlines. Wachovia took a hard year and made it the worst ever, with fee's fee's and more fee's. We are changing banks ASAP! I have had more than I can take. Do you ever know how much money you have in the bank with them?
