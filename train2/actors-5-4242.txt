John Travolta is an extremely talented actor! He is a triple threat because he is a great dancer, actor and singer! He should do more musicals! My favorite movies of his are Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Urban Cowboy, Primary Colors (he did such a great impersonation of Bill Clinton), A Civil Action and The Generals Daughter! I hope he wins an oscar one day! He deserves one!
