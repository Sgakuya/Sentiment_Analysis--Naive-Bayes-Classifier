Johnny Depp is an amazing actor. He is so diverse and interesting to watch. Its weird to think he could play such a messed up character in Leaving Las Vagas, a freaky detective in Sleepy Hollow, a man who has scissors for hands...the list is endless and he always manages to make all of roles very believeable.
