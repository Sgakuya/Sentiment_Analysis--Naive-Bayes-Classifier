I used to work for Progressive as a claims representative in Illinois. Fist of all, the reps are usually fair... it is their managers that you need to look out for, they control what the adjusters can do. If you are injured by a Progressive insured, then they push the rep to meet with you to "discuss" the injury process. Basically, they just want to see if they can get you to settle early to and save them money. This is viewed to be an early settlement opportunity (ESO). If you had only gone to the hospital, then don't expect more than $500 for your pain and suffering (p/s). If you go to the hospital and to your family doctor, then they will go up to $750 for your p/s. If you have an ER visit and more than 1 follow-up visit, then they will offer up to 1500 for your p/s. But what about your continued doctor visits? If you sign a release before you are done with treatment, then they will only pay up to the release amount. If you sign a medical authorization form, then they WILL use that information to argue the best reasons to deny you a fair settlement and offer you a reduced amount for your p/s. Best bet, DO NOT meet with them until you are ready to settle, do not sign a medical authorization form and just give them the records and bills you want to give them (They will threaten a reduced settlement if you do this, but the threat is empty!). Just wait to meet with them until you are done treating so that all bills are covered and you can negotiate a better settlement for your p/s.
