Sea Doo is pitiful! Try 4 engines in 3 seasons! The last one lasted a tank and 1/2 of gas. Sea Doo Reps and service is very poor difficult to deal with. More time is spent in determining who is at fault for 4 engines than fixing the root of the problem. Sea Doo is Doggie Doo. If I had an enemy I'd GIVE tehm one.
