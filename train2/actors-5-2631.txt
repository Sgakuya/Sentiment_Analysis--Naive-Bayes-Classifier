Really diverse. Really talented. Really convincing. I love all of his performances this far and hope to keep on loving them in the future. Primal Fear was so good. He managed to play two totally different people in one movie and make it convincing. He and Richard made that movie one of my all time favorites. Keep up the terrific work Edward!
