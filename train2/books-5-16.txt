This book is absolutely incredible - this book really did upset me when reading about his siblings dying and how his father was always drunk. Its hard to believe that stuff like this actually happened and that he actually survived. It makes you wonder how traumatised he is. The descriptive narrative is fantastic and you can't put the book down. Frank is very honest with what has happened with his life which really keeps you hooked.
