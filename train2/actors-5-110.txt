He was so handsome, but at the same time he was secure enough as an actor to allow himself to be the butt of many gags. He never seemed to mind making a picture where his vunerable side was shown. He could act absent minded or be a clutz and we laughed, but always wanted to be like him. Regardless of the role he was playing on screen, we never saw him in a bad light.
