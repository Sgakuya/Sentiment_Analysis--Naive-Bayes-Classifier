it was HORRIBLE. after looking through bazillions of reviews, i switched to Sunrocket. 500% better. they gave me two free phones with the refer a friend deal, and the phones ROCK, they're not even cheap like i expected. Service went down for a few hours and they gave everyone 25 "rocket rewards" which gave me a $25 gift certificate to Amazon. i LOVE sunrocket. boo to vonage. if you want to join and get free phones, you can use my code if you want: 6177620169 free fast shipping of everything, no downtime that i've noticed, clear as day service. hooray!
