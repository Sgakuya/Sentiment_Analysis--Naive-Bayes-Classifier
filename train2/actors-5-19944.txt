SHOCKED that she is not considerably higher in the list. People say overrated when they simply don't like them. The fact that she never received Emmy nods for her work on Buffy shows just how UNDERrated she is. Strong, consistent, and often impressive she showed she towered above all others in the 'teen idol' crew (Katie Holmes, Jennifer Love Hewitt, etc). She expresses more in her eyes than most can in an hour long monolgue. I'm crushed that Buffy is now gone, but here is hoping that she will flourish in films ( Scooby-Doo2 notwithstanding - BLAH)
