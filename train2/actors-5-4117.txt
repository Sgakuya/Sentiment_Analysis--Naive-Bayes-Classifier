I can't explain in words what this guy does to me. He is of course wonderful at his profession and is one of the lucky ones, except being in the public eye as a celebrity; than comes with the territory... I define him in two words, Carpe Diem . Unfortunatly, I will never meet him in this life, however if I am lucky I will in the next. Keep living your life to the fullest John, so we can all share the unique talent that you have. With great respect always...
