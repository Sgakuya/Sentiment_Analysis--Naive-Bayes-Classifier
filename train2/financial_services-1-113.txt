Let's say you have 200$ in your account and you make an ATM purchase for 3$, 4$, 5$ and 9$ on a specific day - total purchases of 21$ which leaves you with 179$ on your account. Let's say later that evening an check for 180$ goes through which you had only expected to go through a few days later. Thus throwing you 1 dollar into overdraft. Instead of honoring the ATM charges you made earlier, which all went through fine and for which you had receipts and charging you one 30$ overdaft fee for the check which threw you over - they will ALWAYS put the big check through and then charge you $30 overdraft for EACH of the little charges. So you are paying 4 times 30$ = $120 on $21 worth of charges and because you were $1 over. If you had made 10 little charges they would charge you $300 overdraft. If you call them you get rude and unapolagetic staff. Company policy - is what you are told. Of course it is. If you can rob your clients blind rather than treat them with some respect for being clients for many years, it's a no-brainer, right?
