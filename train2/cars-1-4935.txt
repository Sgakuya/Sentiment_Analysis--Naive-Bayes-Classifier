I bought a GMC Sierra 2002 and I put a lot of miles on. I have had it less than 2 years and the heater core is leaking and.....The transmission just blew up. The factory says sorry we can't help you. Isn't that a joke. I can't wait until there are enough people that can get together and put this manufacurer in their place. They can't keep building transmissions that don't last more than two years. What a joke!
