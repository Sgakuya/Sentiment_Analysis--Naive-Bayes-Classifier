Robin is undoubtedly the best actress in daytime, and in my opinion, in all genres! She can play everything- drama, comedy, romance, intrigue- and each type is better than the next. She puts so many layers into her portrayal of Skye that no matter what Skye does, you sit up and take notice. Robin is amazing!!!
