This school always sucked, but really hit the dungheap bigtime in 1970 when those cowardly killers in the Ohio National Guard opened fire on peace protesters and any other innocent bystanders who happened to be walking across campus at the time. Four dead and several wounded for the sake of maintaining order i.e., silencing those who wouldn't be knee-jerk herded into conformity with the Official Nixon Line with the rest of the sheep. firebasecrosby has it all wrong in this regard, and his depraved indifference to the victims of this tragic event showcases the typical rightwing social irresponsibility, antipathy toward dissent and violent-tinged disrespect of humanity. Obviously, firebasecrosby, by merit of his juvenile, sick and braindead comments, isn't old enough to remember this event, and if he/she/it is, that's even worse.
