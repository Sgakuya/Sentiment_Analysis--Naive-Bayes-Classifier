Since L'il Abner is not on the list (why not????), I'd have to rank Blondie as my favorite. It's warm and genuinely funny. And it has some good running gags: the giant sandwiches, the nagging salesmen, his habit of taking baths without locking the door (and forever getting interupted), and his dogs, whose facial expressions are always the same as his. Even though Blondie inadvertently keeps yanking the rug out from under her husband (figuratively speaking), she really adores him. Overall, I think Blondie is the finest.
