Let me start by saying that if your looking for guidance and/or assistance with anything unrelated to actual classes then look somewhere else! I've been in the AAGS for a little more than a year now. In that time I've had 3 Academic Counselors and 6 Financial Counselors! What a joke! Some have moved on, some promoted, and 1 fired! None of which ever give an adequate pass-down to their successors who basically start from scratch. I've had nothing but problems with the financial side of the house. I'm in the military and my school is paid for, nearly 100%, all I have to do is make sure my approval sheets are faxed on time. I still have an outstanding balance that I have proven to be erroneous via transaction letters from the military. My advice to anyone looking for online studies is to stay clear of UOP!
