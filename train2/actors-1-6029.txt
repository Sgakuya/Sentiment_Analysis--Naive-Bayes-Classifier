Man, can this guy pretend to act! He's like a dog trying to use the toilet! It'll try and try and try and never understanding why it can't do it. Mr. Idiot Cruise is the same with his to-cool to act attitude. He starred in two good movies, Rain Man and Top Gun, and that was it. He was disgustingly horrible in all the rest. Including that waste-of-time Eyes Wide Shut. That movie was soo bad, I prayed that someone shot Kubrick in the head 14 times, after I saw that movie!
