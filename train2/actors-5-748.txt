Rock Hudson was a very versatile actor whose performances were nearly always enjoyable. From Giant to Pillow Talk he could believably accomplish drama or light romantic comedy equally as well. I didn't much care for some of his later movies or TV work, but that had more to do with the subject matter than his abilities as an actor. Sadly, future generations may remember him as much for his tragic end and for being the first high profile person to die of AIDS, as they will for his acting career.
