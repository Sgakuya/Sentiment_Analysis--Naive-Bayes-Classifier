Meg Ryan is NOT the Girl Next Door ...Nupe. Cause if she was...I'd never be here at home. (Ever) Meg has something very very special about her. A touch on the petite side at times which brings out the protective instincts in men. All in all, Meg is pretty kewl and very pretty. Soft, sweet,... and a girl who brings out that I Just Gotta Hug Her in me.
