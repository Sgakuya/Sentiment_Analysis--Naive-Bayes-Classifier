I have met bryan twice and have seen how he is not to mention one of my very good friends was seeing him and let me tell you that I was totally disappointed in the real him. He is a show off- wants to be the center of attention, a player, a egotistical jerk and a heartless bastard. He is now my very least favorite days star or any star at that. He lets fans think he is something special,but when you see him away from that...you would be discusted.
