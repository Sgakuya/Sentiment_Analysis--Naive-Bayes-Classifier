I've admired him from afar. I met him in my home town Ballston Spa N.Y. when he was there with Barbra Streisand, i met her too!Along with her double. They were making the movie The Way We Were. He gave me a Kiss for my Sixteenth birthday i'll Never Forget! Right there in the Bar where they were shooting the film. Of corse they were on break. At the time i was Engaged to the Bartender. It was cute ..he asked for permission to kiss me. I'll always be a big fan of his.
