The Da Vinci Code is to me as the Danish cartoons are to Muslims. The self-admissions by Dan Brown in his interviews are all I need to know this is mocking blasphemy disguised as fiction. I hope RIA let's me hate it without seeing it and doesn't do a Brokeback Mountain delete of my comment. Even if the Code were masterfully written, that couldn't redeem it from it's terribleness of denying the divinity of Jesus and inerrancy of scripture. Any shrink will tell you it's possible to program minds, even with fiction.
