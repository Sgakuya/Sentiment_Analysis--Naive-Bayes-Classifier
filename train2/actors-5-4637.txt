Jim Carrey is certainly full of himself--no one denies that. But if I was a s funny and gifted as that man, my ego would be the size of Jennifer Lopez's booty! The Cable Guy is his most underrated flick, Dumb and Dumber his most funny, and The Truman Show his best. Check 'em out! Oh yeah...and Lauren Holly is a gold diggin' bitch!
