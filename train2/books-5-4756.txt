Some things seem a little silly to be rating, and this is one of them. A lot of people hate Shakespeare and this play in particular because it was forced on them in high school. To these people I say come back and give it another try when you are older and hopefully wiser. Some of the English in this play will never be rivaled again in it's perfection. The beauty of the Queen Mab speech is an example of why Shakespeare will probably always be the greatest writer in the English laguage. Hopefully KikiD is joking.
