Annette Bening is one of those talented rarities that come to life once in a generation. Her sense of style, dignity and natural elegance makes her one of the most sensual and beautiful women in the show business today. She does not need to show or prove anything. She was gifted with an angel when it comes to art, that comes out naturally. I am very proud to be one of her biggest admirers. Fabrizio Carlo Rossi Albuquerque, New Mexico
