OH MY GOODNESS. I HAVE BEEN WATCHING SOAPS FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN SO ENGROSSED IN AN ACTRESS AS ADRIANNE FRANTZ. ALTHOUGH THE STORYLINES ARE FICTION SHE HAS A WAY OF MAKING THEM REAL. THE CHEMISTRY THAT SHE HAS WITH RICK IS ABSOLUTELY GREAT. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HER FOR YEARS TO COME.
