I've been there twice, and I hope I won't come back. The airport is terrible, there's human defecation on the sidewalks everywhere, the streets are so crowded and so destroyed...; the higienical conditions, even in upper class places are rather dangerous. Really a bad place to be in case of a strike, or fire: the only one exit from city is on it's higher part, by 12,000 ft. I always try to avoid Bolivia and Peru in my trips.
