For the uninitiated, the Far Side was a single cell (with a few rare exceptions) comic strip that provided a twisted observation on daily life and the human experience, yet by and large stayed away from political issues. It was a particular favorite among college students. My personal favorite was the huge eye reflected in the passenger side mirror with the well known warning that objects are closer than they appear.
