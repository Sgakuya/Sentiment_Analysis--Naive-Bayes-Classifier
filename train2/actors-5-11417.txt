How unfair - drop dead good looks, brains AND talent! There is no doubt in my mind that Ashley Judd is one of the very best of today's younger actresses. I have marveled at her excellent performances in every film I have seen her do so far. Her ability to completely become her character is on a par with people like Tom Hanks, Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. She is so adept at character development that not long ago I was watching one of her films and it took me about 20 minutes to even realize who she was. I hope she lands the high caliber roles she deserves. She certainly has what it takes to handle them.
