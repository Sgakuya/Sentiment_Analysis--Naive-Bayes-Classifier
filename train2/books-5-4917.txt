Gone with the Wind is my favorite book. I saw the movie, but it isn't the same. I read the book for the first time in the 8th grade. Since I keep reading it, I remember most of it. Scarlett does get swept off my Rhett. The story includes her children more, and how she treated them. The movie doesn't have much of that.
