Damm good actor, no doubt about it. He is no Robert Denero, or Al Pacino, but hell not many People are. I like alot of Mel Gibson Movies, he is one of my favorites, but I will have to say he isn't the best actor that came out of hollywood or anything, he is one of the best though. My fav movies with Mel would be all 3 of the Mad Max flicks, damn good action movies. He was also good in the Lethal Weapons, he even played Hamlet great, the guy is very talented he can play many roles. His movie Braveheart was truly badass too.
