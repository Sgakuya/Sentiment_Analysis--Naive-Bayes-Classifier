I don't smoke, and I'm not planning to. Malboro has been one of those American Icons . They spend millions on advertising and I really like the scenarios on their advertisments. However, the hypocrisy comes in with that. They show beautiful visions of the country side (Malboro Country) mountains and fields, but in the end would you attain that dream if you are helping destroy it? Gee... Not only that you're destroying yourself.
