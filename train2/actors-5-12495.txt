Was introduced to her in Sisters and have a fan since. Is a perfect combo of beauty, class, brains and charm in an era where it is few and far in between amongst actresses. Is still drop-dead beautiful as she ages gracefully. We need more of her and less of the J-Lo's and Jessica Simpsons of the world.
