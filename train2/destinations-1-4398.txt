Lived in Charlotte for the longest short period of time in my life. You can't tell the difference between these two places. They are nothing but suburban sprawl, with no real sense of community. The only time you get any excitment in this stupid place is when Clay Aiken (a local) comes out with a new album. Avoid it if you want a quality life for you or your kids. Avoid charlotte as well. Again, not that you would be able to tell the difference
