I've seen him laugh, act like a fool, and I've seen him cry in movies. He's just really down-to-earth. I wouldn't mind spending a couple of hours just staring at his gorgeous face. He's a Prince,and getting to it, but not quite a king. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy! I've seen him act in all kinds of movies, and I wouldn't mind spending a whole week seing just Ben Affleck movies 24/7. The guy's cool. Good Day!
