I went to Pittsburgh for school and am unfortunately still here while I look for work...ELSWHERE. From a distance it looks like it offers a lot, but then you find out it's filled with hillbillies, abandoned buildings, and generic people who thrive on their losing sports teams. It is true that there are some intellectual, artsy-types, but most of the time they are not from here. There is only one area of the city that is truly ethnically diverse and the rest is a zebra. The easiest way to describe pittsburgh is West Virginia that happens to have black people.
