OK, I didn't even think it was possible to find 2 dirty cities in Missouri. But St Louis is actually WORSE than Kansas City. Go figure. This place is so dirty, I felt like washing my hands the entire time I was there. And the people..OMG ! I do not know who controls the image of this city, but downtown is in serious need of reimaging, as it is falling apart and looking all sorts of array. I would be scared to go into some of those old buildings down by the Mississippi. And the Interstate that goes thru this concrete jungle is a nightmare worse than even Chicago. We were almost killed twice by the ignorant drivers there. But that is how St Louis is, one minute the freeway is bumper to bumper, and a little later, it looks like a ghost town..it is creepy. And I would recommend no one move there.
