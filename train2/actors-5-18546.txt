Put aside the wine commercials and the caricature that he became later in his life, this man was brilliant in front of and behind a camera. He made (arguably) the greatest motion picture ever made, Citizen Kane. It was a movie that fought tooth and nail to maintain his artistic vision. In that respect, it is one of film-makings most focused projects, as Welles poured everything he had into it. For this alone, the man is a five star director.
