The coolest Chinese man on Earth. Unfortunately most asian actors are given specifically asian roles; even in movies made in Hong Kong the roles are pretty stereotyped, but Chow Yun Fat is so good he could be the leading man in any Hollywood movie. He also smokes real cool, or chews a toothpick real cool, or does anything with his mouth in just a really cool way.
