Russell Crowe is a grrrreat actor. the first time i ever saw him was on Gladiator, then i saw him in Proof of Life. I enjoyed both movies but i have to say that i liked Proof of Life better. i liked the chemistry him and Meg Ryan had. Meg Ryan is my favorite actress and russell is my favorite actor. i think they should reunite and make another movie together
