One actor of great versatility of movie roles is why 5.0!! There are so many that it will fill my comments screen. Examples; Mr. Roberts, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Days Of Wine And Roses, Save That Tiger, Missing, and to really show in one film his versatility see Irma La Douce. Still enjoy that last film. A truly great actor is one who is not limited in what he can do on screen. These are the films I remember best about this actor of great dramatic sense as well as great comedic sense on screen.
