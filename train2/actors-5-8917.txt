I'd like to start out by saying Sandra Bullock is an awesome actress and all her movies ROCK! I also respect that she keeps her morals high and follows them. She doesn't give in to anyone and she keeps her personal life to herself. I respect that, I mean just because she is an actress does't mean she should tell the public everything about her life.
