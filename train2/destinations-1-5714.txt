About Miami...great place to visit but not to live. The city is very overrated when it comes to year-round living. Pull back the party-time veneer and the city holds very little substance. If you're wealthy, retired with time on your hands, or have a high-five to six-figure income you'll be ok. The cost of living is rising faster than the rest of the country yet salaries are not keeping pace. Now, the truth about the climate...it's shockingly hot and humid, and ocean breezes are rare. During winter, the humidity still hovers. It's so darn uncomfortable. Finally, the traffic...poor urban planning has made traffic very inconvenient and a sprawling region of a mess rather than a city. There's a reason why the area is referred to as South Florida--get ready to drive EVERYWHERE. Move here, uninformed, and you're in for an unnerving reality check.
