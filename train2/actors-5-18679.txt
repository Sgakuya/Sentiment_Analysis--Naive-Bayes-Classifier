Ken Burns is not a great 'documentary' filmmaker. . .he is a great filmmaker period. All of his work (Baseball, Jazz, Thomas Jefferson, Civil War) manage to breathe life and human interest in American history. American history is violent, wonderful, terrible, and beautiful all at the same time. Burns somehow manages to capture the emotion. He is a highly underrated artist.
