I had a crush on Bruce since I was really young...I loved him in Moonlighting and when he potrays that witty, cutting sarcastic type guy he is at his best. I do not think he is given enough credit and has been suprisingly good in more dramatic roles as well..He is also one of the few actors in Hollywood that does not follow that usual sickening over the top liberal/I hate Bush/I practice Kabballah (pick one) trend...seems like a good dad too!
