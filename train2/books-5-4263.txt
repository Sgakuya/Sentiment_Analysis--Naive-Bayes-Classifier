A profoundly moving book, I read it in less than a week while in high school, often during other classes. It's a complex book with meaning on many levels- (look into Anna's dream sequences) however the numerous long sections on Russian provincial government proceedings got a little boring and took away from sucha tragically written love story. I can't wait to share this book with my daughters someday.
