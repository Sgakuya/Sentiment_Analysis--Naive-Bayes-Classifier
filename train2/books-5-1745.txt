What happens when a carnivorous business-wolf marries an hervivorous I.T. rabbit? You get Kevin and Kell. Story lines range from computer related to current events to a business whose corporate edict is to thin the herd . Never predictable, but always entertaining, I highly recommend K K. K K is the longest running syndicated online comic and probably the first ever produced. Written and drawn by Bill Holbrook who simultaneously draws two nationaly syndicated comic strips, On the FastTrack and Safe Havens.
