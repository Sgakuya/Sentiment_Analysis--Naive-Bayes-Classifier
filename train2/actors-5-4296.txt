The first time I ever went to the drive-in I saw a double feature..Urban Cowboy and Grease (I was 8) and there began my love for John Travolta. He has proven that he has a wide range of talent and is only getting better. Excellent actor..he'll always be best as Zuko in the black leather pants to me though!
