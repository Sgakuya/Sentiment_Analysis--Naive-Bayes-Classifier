Great actress... Remember when she was Sam on 'Who's the Boss' and she turned out that brilliant epsiode when she had to wear a cup for her Little league team? Total tak-off form the Bad News Bears movie but she handled it much more professionally and with more charm tha Jody Foster. She is really pretty.. and nice. I need to take a break from this now.
