ANOTHE GREAT MOVIE FROM TOM HANKS. HE IS ONE OF THE BEST ACTORS IN HOLLYWOOD OR ANY WHERE FOR THAT MATTER. CAST AWAY WAS SO INTENSE. I WAS HOLDING A TEN DOLLAR BILL(FOLDED UP) DURING THE PLANE CRASH. I THREW IT UP IN THE AIR, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I DID THAT UNTIL HE WAS FLOATING IN THAT RAFT. I HAD TO WAIT TILL THE MOVIE ENDED TO LOOK FOR IT. IT WAS ON THE FLOOR BEHIND ME. I CRIED THROUGH THE THE LAST 15 MINUTES. WE ARE STILL WONDERING WHAT WAS IN THE BOX!!!!!
