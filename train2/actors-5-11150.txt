Nicole Kidman is a true star. Her movie choices are so variable(think Moulan Rouge vs. The Hours). She is very charismatic and sophisticated and truely genuine. When she first came out I wasn't all that impressed, but you know - with time and age you get to see things differently. I think she is a true gem for present day.
