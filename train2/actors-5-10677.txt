She's a great actress and has been wonderful in a variety of films. However, I have to admit, I enjoy her most in the James Bond movies. She brings a very real touch of drama and class to movies that are often sorely lacking both. When she is on screen, it seems to be a much more serious film, and not just a summer popcorn flick.
