I agree with all the above comments ( No 1-5 ). Two weeks ago I didnot know who Jason Isaacs was! After watching The Patriot DVD for the first time I was totally blown away by the whole package ( the great looks,mesmerizing eyes, captivating voice and tremendous acting talents). Best of all to find out he is such a sweet person from all the chats and interview.( I'm running out of adjectives ) :))
