I am ashamed to be one of her many fans that only took notice when she was announced as Queen Amidala in Episode I. I think she is the best actress in her age group and that if she got the right part she could easily grab an Oscar. She has a spot at the top of my ten most beautiful women list. The girl has brains, integrity, and beauty.
