The Scarlet Letter is the best book I have ever read. Hawthorne displays the artistic touch that authors don't have anymore as he paints this subtle, captivating story of love, guilt, corruption, redemption, and hope. Before I began reading The Scarlet Letter, all I heard was how boring it was. But as I began reading, page after page was brilliant. Hawthorne beautifully counterbalances the somewhat dark subject material of the book with a prologue that is lighter mood, and at times even deleriously funny.
