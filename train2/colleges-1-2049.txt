What an overated school. Average SAT score is, like 1260. This school sucks. The average person from NC who goes here is not that bright. However, it is difficult to get in out of state. Last year 10,000 people applied from out of state and only 7,000 from in state. Carolina can only have about 20% of their students from out of state.
