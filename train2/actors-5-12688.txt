Charlise is an amazingly beutiful womoan. She has a simple and timeless elegance that is rare, even in hollywood. I think that the best thing about her is that she is deceptively beautiful. She does not scream beauty as some actresses do, though she is more attractive than most of them. She is cute and sexy at the same time which makes her even more desireable. I have only seen her in a couple of roles and she has impressed me, particularly in Cider House Rules. I give Charlise 11/10 in the looks department and 8/10 as an actress.
