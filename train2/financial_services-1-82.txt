Just tell me how it can be legal for a bank to hold funds on authorizations to your account??? Case in point: Standard reservation authorization to Embassey Suites for a room to be used 3 weeks from now for $230. The bank has your money in your account, but if you have something go through before that authorization drops off(1-3 business days), you may bounce because the bank is withholding(and using) your $230. Looks like a class action suit waiting to happen.
