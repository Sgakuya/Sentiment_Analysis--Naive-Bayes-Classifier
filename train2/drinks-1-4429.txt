You cannot taste anything beyond the iodine in this scotch - it's so overwhelming that my wife, who was drinking Jack Daniels, took a sip after I expressed my disappointment with my new purchase (last bottle was Glenfiddich - excellent) and could not taste anything but iodine for the next 30 minutes.
