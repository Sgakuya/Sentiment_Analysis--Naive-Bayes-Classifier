I have an IRA & MF with them. I lost heavily on my IRA, besides 25$ fee every quarter. I finally decided to move my IRA out. It took me more than a month to get the money out. I sold my MF. When I called for the check after a week I go the reply stating that they were in the process of finding my bank account to transfer the funds. I have no bank account with them, whatsoever. According to me they are big rip off. Stay away from them.
