I really don't think this car sucks, but you guys have rated it higher than the true supercars so I feel I have to knock it down to bring it back to its true place. That said, the Supra is a very nice, fast, agile, comfortable automobile that probably deserves an overall rating of around 4.0. I must say that most of you members here are morons. The fastest production vehicle in the world (McLaren F1, 11sec quarter, 3sec 0-60, 230mph top speed) is ranked number 30 on this list while the relatively tame Supra is number one? This is just plain ridiculous. Oh yeah, Red Celica GT, the Sledgehammer was a one-off car. Only one was ever made. Callaway offered to replicate the car for prospective buyers for around $800,000 but had no bidders, so no Sledgehammer ever saw production. And yes, the McClaren F1 is the fastest production car out there... Added on 12-21-00: Dude what in the name of God is a McLearn?
