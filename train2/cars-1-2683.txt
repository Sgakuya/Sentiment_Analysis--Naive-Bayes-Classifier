Outdated v8 garbage. This car has a large following of undereducated older people. If you learned about other cars like the Supra before talking it would look better for you. The supra is one of the worlds strongest cars. It has an inline 6 200ci twin turbo setup rwd with a six speed manual. Top ungoverned speed in over 180mph stock. 0 - 60 in under 5 sec stock. Moddified they have blown over 1400+ rwhp on a stock block. 0-60 is then around 1.6 sec top speed 276mph. NO MUSTANG CAN TOUCH THIS! V8 is a very unbalanced setup and too big they cant handle so much horse stock...plus they are unreliable. BTW that 1400+ rwhp is on pump gas! Please learn you facts before you talk. MUSTANG=CHEAP, SUPRA=HIGH QUALITY. What will you mustange be worth in 10 6 years? Did you know anything performance mod more than a air filter in a ford voids the waranty? Not so in a toyota. Guess one of these companys must have a reliability fear...ford=kia quality,performance! j/k sorta ,kia realy sucks.
