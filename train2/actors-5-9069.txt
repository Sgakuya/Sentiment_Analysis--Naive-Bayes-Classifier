Meryl is the best actress I've ever met. Down there says an anonymous: ... adultery... . Yes, she works in that kind of movies, BECAUSE SHE CAN MAKE YOU FEEL THE PASSION, THE PAIN, THE SHAME, THE SADNESS. She is THE real actress. It is sooooo sad you can't see it. Bad thing, but the light is given to two or three, and no one else. Sorry. Next time come earlier.
