If i was not influenced by Speilbergs movies at such a young age, i wouldn't be the thriving young director if am today. He has influenced me and many other directors in the feild all over the world. His movies are insperational and fun to watch. He is great in every aspect imagionable. From Cinimotagraphy to CGI. I love to watch Spielberg movies because i know every movie will be fun to watch.
