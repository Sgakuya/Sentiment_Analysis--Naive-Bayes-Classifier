Anyone who has the priveledge of playing the president in a movie, has to be considered a good actor, but take a step back a black man(real case scenario he would be dead within a week) playing the president, damn talk about an honor wooh! how about a priveledge well it would be dream, Slap!!! wake up, well at least the fantasy made it to the big screen(probably turned allot of stomachs and made allot of folks that past on turn in their graves) and we can say this man is definetly an artist in his field not bad for a guy who appeared on the electric company long ago for those who remember this show in detail, I won't feel to bad about my age later!!!
