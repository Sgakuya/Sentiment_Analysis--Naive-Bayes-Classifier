At present Im trying to view Holy Smoke in all its entirety. Yet all I am left with is a smoking hole. That is an aviation slang phrase for a fallen aviator. The movie is making out Kate into an outstanding cult figure. She has swapped her innocence of beauty for a shining intelligence. Hence her most endeavour in the film ENIGMA. As the girlfriend of an intelligence officer. Helping him through his nervous breakdown and together the two of them crack a German U-boat code.
