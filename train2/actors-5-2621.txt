I think Edward is a great actor. He plays his carictors very well. I think that he played great rolls in Anrican History X, Primal Fear, and the Fight Club. I think that he may have inspired alot of people with his move American History X. And it may have changed alot of peoples veiws. So thats why I gave Edward 5 stars.
