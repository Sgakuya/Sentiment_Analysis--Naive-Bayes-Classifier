Why in GODS name is this crappy novel so popular?Was it because she had some idea's and shoved them into characters that have as much inner life as a televison set? Who the Hell is talking about the absence of presence anyways?What's it matter? This book sucks.I bet I am the only person on the East Coast to admit it.
