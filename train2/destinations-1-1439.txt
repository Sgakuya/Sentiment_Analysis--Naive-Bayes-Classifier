The French do not understand that for their nation to gain international respect as a world power it first has to become a world power. This means having a large economy strong enough to support a well equipped, skilled and highly motivated military that can rapidly deploy massive firepower and logistical support anywhere on the globe. A country does not become a world power because of it s history or it s culture or it s cuisine or the philosophy of it s leaders, it occurs after a country has the ability to project it s diplomatic, economic and military might wherever needed AND THEN other countries listen to what it has to say because it s words are backed by something more than words themselves. The French are rather self-absorbed and see things differently, which is precisely why their nation became completely irrelevant.
