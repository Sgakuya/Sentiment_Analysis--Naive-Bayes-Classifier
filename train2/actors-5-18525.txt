Fantastically out of this world. He's taken his skills and genius that he showed as a Python and taken it to a higher level. 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' is very surreal and is very amazing. I found it very easy and pleasurable to watch. As for '12 Monkeys' Wow! Fantastic plot and acting to boot. I love his use of camerawork and photography. I hope he carries on directing these type of films and enthralling us even more.
