Calvin and Hobbes was so personal and relatable. It conjures up images of summertime and innocence and days that have since past. Not to mention it was hilarious on a consistent basis. Quite possible the best comic strip ever made. Dilbert is really good, and Garfield used to be great, but Calvin and Hobbes is king.
