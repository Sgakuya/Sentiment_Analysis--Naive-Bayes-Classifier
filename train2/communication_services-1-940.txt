Judging from the other comments, AT T's service seems to vary widely depending on where you are. In the NY/NJ/CT area, I can tell you, service is horrible. I've got a Nokia 8260 phone through work, and it's downright embarrassing -- I'm hesitant to use it for any important call, it's so unreliable. My colleagues feel the same way (they call it 'AT Terrible'), so it's not just my phone. My wife has much better service with SprintPCS, despite using a cheap outdated phone.
