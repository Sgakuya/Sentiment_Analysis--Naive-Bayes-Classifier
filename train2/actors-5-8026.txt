i first saw audrey hepburn in breakfast at tiffany's when a teacher told me a had a strong resemblance to the actress. this was the greatest compliment i had ever had. not only was she beautiful, but she was an award winning actress with grace, poise, style, elegance, and the list could go on and on. she was very well known for her work with unicef which expresses great empathy. while she possessed all of these admireable qualities, which often tends to inflate ones ego, she was able to maintain humility and and an uncommon neutrallity as far as the media was concerned. in my own humble opinion, she made brown puppy dog eyes, a not-so-small nose, dark hair, and a little frame a beautiful thing. (im especially thankful!). she is truly a role model in every aspect.
