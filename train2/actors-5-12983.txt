I will always remember Sylvia Kristel's roles in the Emmanuelle movies. I used to watch the Emmanuelle movies on Cinemax "Friday Night After Dark" when i was younger. These soft core movies were great. They were both sensual and adventurous. I did not see Sylvia Kristel's role in Private Lessons until about 2 years ago. This movie debuted when i was only 7 years old. I think no other actress could have done a better job playing a housekeeper who seduces a teenage boy to help scam a large sum of money from his rich father. She was great, but she had a body double for the nude scenes in that movie. After seeing this movie , i was surprised that it was not banned. Maybe it was banned throughout the 1980's. I might never know. Whatever might of happened, it probably caused a heavy stirr!
