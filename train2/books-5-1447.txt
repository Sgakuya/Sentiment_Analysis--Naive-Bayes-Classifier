Pearls is a great comic in waiting. It centers around the activities of a rat (called Rat) and his friend the pig. Rat is self centred, Pig is gullible. They also have several friends, a zebra who is tormented by a couple of inept crocodiles, and a goat. The strip generally revolved around Rat doing vicious things to Pig. It is very funny but as you can probably read really hard to describe.
