Do NOT Buy ESURANCE. If you value customer service, answers and fair treatment do NOT Purchase Esurance. This Company recieves The worst rating an individual can possibly give, AND I was only a customer for 3 WEEKS. Well I suppose I'm still a customer until they actually cancel my policy (1 week and counting). Let me say, in this 3 week period my rate doubled due to 'Review' and them claiming to have never recieved previous policy information. Which was sent, several times. They always gave the same answer 'we didn't recieve it'. You have no recourse and then all you can do is watch your rate SKYROCKET. Do yourself a favor and purchase a legit BRAND NAME for your insurance needs. Simple. Dealing with an Insurance company with NO Agents and NO Office is impossible. No answers, only promised followup, which never comes.
