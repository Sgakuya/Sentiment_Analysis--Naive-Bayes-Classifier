Brittany Murphy was brilliant as the troubled Daisy Randone in Girl Interrupted. She won the hearts of everyone as the shy Tai Frasier in Clueless. She was dramatic as Nikki in Spun. Brittany Murphy displays great talent when acting and she really develops into her roles. Her final scene in Girl Interrupted really moved me and brought me to tears.
