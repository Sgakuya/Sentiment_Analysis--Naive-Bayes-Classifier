Outside of Montreal and the Pontiac, Quebec is a place to go if you want to see some backwards hicks. Quebec makes the Ozarks look like the height of sophistication in comparism. Most French Canadians have a class A attitude problem and hate the English, particuarly English Canadians. They tolerate Americans because they want the money, but try driving around Quebec with Ontario plates on. Visit Montreal.
