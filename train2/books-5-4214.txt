Largely dismissed as a meandering, contentless tale for coarse teenagers. Salinger's Catcher in the Rye offers wonderful insight into teenage middle class malaise. Holden's search for self and stuggle to mature, can strike a chord with people of any age who have ever felt alone. The only people who seem unhappy with the book are spoiled kids with impossibly doting parents or crusty old men who think youngsters whine too much.
