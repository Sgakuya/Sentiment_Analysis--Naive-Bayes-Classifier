Ted King is the only reason I still watch GH. He manages to shine in every scene even when the wrting is terrible .The writers at GH are a bunch of fools for not taking advantage of this gifted actors abilities. His scene stealing acting has gotten 1 particular veteran leading man shaking in his little boots.
