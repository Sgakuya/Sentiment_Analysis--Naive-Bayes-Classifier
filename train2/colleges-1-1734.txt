I truly feel sorry for the people who attend Ohio State. I wonder what it's like always living in the shadows of universities that are superior in every aspect (e.g., the University of Michigan). I guess that explains why Ohio State students have such a big chip on their shoulder. If I was stuck there, I'd be defensive too.
