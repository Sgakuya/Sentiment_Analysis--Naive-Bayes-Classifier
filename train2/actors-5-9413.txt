Jodie Foster is one of the best actors around. She is so smart and so classy - not your typical Hollywood celeb. She seems like she is her own person and not a collective thinker. I loved her in The Silence of the Lambs. She was unbelievable in that movie. One of Hollywood's best! Don't see enough of this fine actress.
