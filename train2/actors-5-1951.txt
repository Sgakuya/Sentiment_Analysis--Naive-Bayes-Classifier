I had the grand opportunity of meeting and hangin with Johnny Boy a few times, and I tell you all: Not only is the guy genuine, but he's wholesome, and simple! He's got a personality like a diamond and he belongs in the eyes of strangers at every moment! I am really proud of every one of his accomplishments, and the way he's matured as a Hollywood leading man! Johnny Boy, you don't need an Oscar to measure your calliber of excellence, you have thousands of folks just like me that hold you up to our sky. Shine Johnny Boy, and let the rest of the world wonder: What next ! Peace, Vampire Eyes
