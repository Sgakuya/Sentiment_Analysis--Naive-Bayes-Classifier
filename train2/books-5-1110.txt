The true Boxcars- those written by Warner- are stellar. Afterward they became formulaic and predictable. These were the first chapter books I read to my kids at bedtime. We must have gone through 50 at least. Wonderful adventures of the kids looking after themselves following their parents' deaths. Soon they're reunited with their wealthy but estranged Grandfather Alden. Now the adventures are pure mysteries, but still exciting! Get the older ones and you can't miss.
