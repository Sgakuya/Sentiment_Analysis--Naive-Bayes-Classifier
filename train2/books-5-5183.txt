I don't understand the other reviewers on this page. For me, Prayer for Owen Meany was one of the most unique pieces of fiction that I have ever read, and beautifully written. The character of Owen is especially bizarre - puny and speech disabled on the one hand, with this amazing, almost Christ-like charisma on the other. It is very hard to review this book without giving anything way, so let's just leave it at this - Prayer for Owen Meany is a beautiful, beautiful book that, chances are, is like no other that you will read.
