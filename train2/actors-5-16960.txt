Olga is the best damn actress on daytime, and they continually misuse her talent and leave her character Lena completely out of the Bianca storyline It would serve AMC if Olga quit. I don't want her to, but another soap would grab her up and she would be able to have a storyline of her own. Go Olga!!! Lahv ya girlfriend
