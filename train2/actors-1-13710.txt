i think she is a very naturally pretty girl and unlike most actresses portraying teens she actually looks like a typical teen. However, her acting in American Beauty was very over the top and unatural. Her performance was the only thing that brought down an otherwise flawless film. On a more catty note, why doesn't she do something about her teeth. meow!!! ok, lol, i'm done.
