This is one of those books which should be read at a particular point in one's life (like Huckelbery Finn or Confessions of a Crap Artist or In the Name of the Father). Salinger captures the inner workings of a teenager's mind (at least some teenagers). People who liked this novel would also like The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner or the movie My Own Private Idiho .
