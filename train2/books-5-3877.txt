I LOVED it. The book is great. I, as a high-school sophomore in the pretigious IB program, don't see anything wrong with the piece of literature for it to be banned. It teaches character, and mocks a lot of the norms society has today. What ever happened to freedom of speech? Put Huck Finn back in our schools!
