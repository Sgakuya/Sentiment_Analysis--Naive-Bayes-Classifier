Walt Kelly's Pogo is probably the greatest and most influential comic strip ever. Pogo represents a brilliant combination of lush artistry, unforgettable characters, hilarious storylines, unabashed wackiness, and acutely topical political humor that was unmatched then and has not been matched since. Without Pogo, there would be no Calvin Hobbes (note the similarities between Kelly's Albert the Alligator and Hobbes, and of course Pogo and Calvin) and no Bloom County - and these are only the most obvious (and best) of the strips influenced by Pogo. If you're a fan of Watterson or Breathed, you're a fan of Walt Kelly, even if you don't know it. Do yourself a favor and find yourself a Pogo collection. Beautiful, rich, artful, smiling genius.
