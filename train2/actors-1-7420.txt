Take the first Rocky and Dukes of Flatbush out of his resume, and there's not much there. He fell in love with his Nautilus machine two decades ago, and gave up acting for body building. At this point he's just an ugly caricature of himself. There are worse actors out there, Keanu Reeves for one, but he's undeserving of the praise some folks are lavishing on him here.
