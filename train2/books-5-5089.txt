One of the first examples of naturalism in American writing. Very advanced for its time. Tightly written and convincing, considering its author never saw war up to the time he wrote it. Crane was about 24 years old when this book appeared, so one can easily say he was precocious. It is a slight work, but very contemporary in its spirit.
