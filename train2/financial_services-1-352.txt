BankOne is about the worst financial organization I have ever encountered. Customer Service ? None. They never responded to my secure email messages for information about new account procedures, the local branch manager (Batavia IL) had the gall to suggest that I might be a thief when I wanted to cash an out of state Cashiers Check, and today they allowed checks to clear from my account that were dated for a month from now. Bad, bad, bad. Avoid at all costs !
