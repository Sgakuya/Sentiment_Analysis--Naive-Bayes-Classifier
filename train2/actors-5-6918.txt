okay, the guys body of work has some incrediblly bad moments. Yes, he was in the terrible movies The Trigger Effect, The Flintstones and (I grimis at the recollection) Showgirls. BUT PLEASE do not forget this man was portrayed the unforgettibly and dangerously curious Jeffery in the Lynch masterpiece Blue Velvet. And above all his other performances, the one that no other actor could have ever pulled off, FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper on the greatest show of all tim, Twin Peaks. His work on the show as well as the feature film, Fire Walk With Me, is phenominal. He was born for the part and has left n indelible mark on pop culture as an icon of the best humanity has to offer. The man has had nothin but crap roles since the cancilation of the show. Yeah, he plays the guys who hasa limp dick on Sex and the City and yeah, those were his tanned butt cheeks in Showgirls, but damn it, that shows grit and character!!!! Thae man is a hero and a role model. Kyle, you ar high in my book, buddy. Even if you are on Sex and the City and cant get it up. gent Cooper lives on in my heart.
