i am in my 4th year here at Temple. i have to take a 5th year, just like many here (it's not really that common to graduate in 4 years here anymore). i really don't like temple at all. most of the people who work here are rude and disrespectful. some of the people who work as secretaries and receptionists can't even speak proper english... and i don't mean because english isn't their first language, i mean because they are poorly educated. i dont know where Temple gets some of these people from. it seems they would want to make a good impression on their educational institution by having employees with an education. also, i live off campus and i try to avoid campus as much as possible because the people are just not nice. well, a lot of people live off campus actually, especially now since ONLY freshman get housing! after your freshman year, plan on getting an expensive apt. in a horrible neighborhood. its very dangerous around here... very. also, in my 4 years, i think i have had a total of no more than 5 teachers whom i would consider to be good. Again, i don't know where they get some of these people from. Temple always seems to try to make everything difficult. And in my major, there are 3 advisors for over 2,000 people. so if you want an appointment with an advisor, plan on making it wayyy in advance. i guess the good thing is that in general, Temple has a good name as a university, so hopefully it will look good on my resume.
