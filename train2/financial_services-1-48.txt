why do they take so long to post funds to the account? with all my experiences with various banks none of them operate like this except for usbank. my account has only been open for 1 month and i havent really used it untill now. When they say that the first $100 is available to you when you make a deposit...that is a lie, it doesnt apply if you cash a $1500 check and deposit $500 of it...and i quote...the "first $100 was already given to you in cash" that sounds made up and illogical. the customer service reps act like theyre laughing at you when you ask them a legitimate question and they point out that your balance is "only $2" they dont seem to have "any supervisors available" When you are finally sucessful with moving up the chain of command by asking to speak to the supervisor's supervisor they seem to respond well when you threaten them by telling them you are going to contact your attorney general about thier business practices. for everyone having trouble with usbank contact the better business bureau or your attorny general in your state...thats what they are there for.
