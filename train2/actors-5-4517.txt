Elijah Wood is such a talented actor. He's only 21, but he's already been in so many great movies! I mean, he played the main character in FOTR (Fellowship of the Ring, which is the best movie to come out in a longggg time. Even if Elijah had never acted before doing the Lord of the Rings trilogy, he'd always be remembred as an actor for playing that role. That would be the high point in anyone's career! But he's also been in so many other excellent movies too, like The Ice Storm and Rdaio Flyer , just to name a few. He's definitely a lot more talented than a lot of actors you see in all these stupid teen movies.
