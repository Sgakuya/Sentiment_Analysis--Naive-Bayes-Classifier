I absolutely love Kim! Her character,Reva Shayne,on the drama series Guiding Light is what got me hooked and the reason im a HUGE Kim Fan! She's the absolute best actress in daytime and has 3 emmy's to prove of her wonderful talent! Kim can make any storyline interesting even the weird ones she is sometimes handed! You are definately the best,Kim!!
