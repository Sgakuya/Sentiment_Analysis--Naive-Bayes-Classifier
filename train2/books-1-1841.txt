As a Southerner I am very offended by this strip. Original cartoonist and creator Al Capp was a native New Englander (born in New Haven, CT)which might explain his yankee distain for those not of his region. He was a guest speaker at our college in the 1960's. This incredible jerk arrived stinking drunk, groped several coeds, and tried to assault one who was escorting him around campus. His speech was cancelled and he was told to never return to our state or he would face arrest.
