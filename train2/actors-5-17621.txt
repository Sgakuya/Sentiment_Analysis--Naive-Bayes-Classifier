I have watched All My Children for several years. I have always loved Susan's style wardrobe and hair she is pure class. I cried when she won her emmey and have all the articles. She was so gracious, and such a lady all the years she should have won and didn't. This is the only show I watch I tape it and watch when I get home from work.
