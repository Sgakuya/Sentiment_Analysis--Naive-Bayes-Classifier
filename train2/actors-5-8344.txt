This poor woman was so used and exploited by her mother and by the MGM machine. She had tremendous talent but she was so abused as a young person she was never able to build her life on a stable foundation. She was incomparable in The Wizard of Oz , and she definitely deserved to win the Best Actress Oscar for A Star is Born, instead of losing to pretty girl Grace Kelly.
