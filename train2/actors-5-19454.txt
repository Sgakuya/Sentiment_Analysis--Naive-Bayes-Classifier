Grammer has played the same character for almost two decades now, and still, he is able to pull it off amazingly. Frasier Crane is definately one of my favorite television characters of all time- I really can't imagine anyone else playing that role. However, he is also a very good drama actor, playing George Washington in the recent movie on A E about Benedict Arnold. Kelsey Grammer is a first class actor who is often not given enough credit for his amazing skills which have been depicted on the screen and on the stage as well.
