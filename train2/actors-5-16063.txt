I think Sonny showed a lot of warm feelings towards Carly durning her break down & towards Michael helping him cope with Carly's break down. I just saw Maurice as Desi Arneiz in "Before the Laughter" about Lucllie Ball & Desi. He was great as I was watching the movie & watching Maurice I felt like I was really watching Desi himself. I always watched Lucy & desi in I Love Lucy tv show & Maurice was so much like Desi Iam sure he studied charater he played very well. I would love to see Sonny & Jason turn out to be under cover FBI's that would kill Durant Rick would be happy Max would be surprized along with Alan & Monica thank you bye now Linda
