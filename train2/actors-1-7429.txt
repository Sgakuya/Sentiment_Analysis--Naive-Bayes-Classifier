 Glupf magahuef, agotaglin stenglentha putomassim. In wha jultphyman, postymilko retenthofo. Thank you Mr. Stallone, for your well-considered comments. I recently saw Rocky for the first time in over 20 years and I was appalled at how lame, stupid, predictable and retarded that film was: I had forgotten what dreck it is. And that was the best entry in that totally crappy series. Furthermore, I hope this guy is proud of himself: seems every time there's some horrorstory in the news about a school shooting or some crazed SOB killing a dozen people at a restaurant or something, the Rambo imagery is always present. Always with the combat fatigues, armed to the teeth, misunderstood loner posture, etc., that come straight out of one of Stallone's pinhead productions. For these homicidially deranged wretches who want to take out their frustrations and disappointment in themselves on the innocent, on the defenseless, on strangers, Rambo becomes the inspiration/model for ensuing acts of wholesale carnage that become Real Life Tragedy while Stallone laughs all the way to the bank. This steroid-poisoned, talentless, brain-damaged clod has blood on his hands because the subtext of his action films is: It's cool, and justifiable, to be like Rambo. Really sick.
