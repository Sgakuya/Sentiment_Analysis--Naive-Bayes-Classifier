A truly talented actor, he is top notch in everything he does whether its acting or directing. He was excellent as William Wallace in Braveheart, he also did a great job in directing it too. He was also excellent in The Patriot, though I thought the movie was too biased Mel Gibson does some of his best acting of his career. Just watch the scene where his son dies.
