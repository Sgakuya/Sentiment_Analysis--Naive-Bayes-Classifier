Rockin Robins portrayal of Skye is soooooo emotional and fun. She can take any script(good or bad) and deliver. You do not have to take my word for it, watch General Hospital. Oh and because I think Robin deserves more than just five stars heres another five-*****, because she is just that good. -victrolalights-
