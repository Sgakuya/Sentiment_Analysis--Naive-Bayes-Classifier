Jacquie Courtney is best remembered as Alice Frame on Another World & Pat Ashley on One Life To Live. The character of Pat started out as a beautiful career woman who eventually hosted her own TV talk show. Unfortunately, Pat evolved into a somewhat goofy parody of herself as the show went on, who wore an awful knot hairdo, & eventually had no storyline left to speak of.
