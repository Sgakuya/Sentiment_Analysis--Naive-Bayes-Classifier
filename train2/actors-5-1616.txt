This man has amazing acting range not to mention apparent excellent taste when it comes to selecting his work...and I am sure he's had that option for quite awhile. Over the years his characters have made me laugh (Young Frankenstein) question their sanity (Bonnie and Clyde) warmed my heart and made me cry (Hoosiers). Hackman can truly do it all!
