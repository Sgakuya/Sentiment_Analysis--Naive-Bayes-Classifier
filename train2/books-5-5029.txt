Hemingway's beautifully written novella of superhuman effort against all odds, in which a man surpasses possibility and even still loses the prize. Some readers have trouble with Hemingway's laconic style, which is most laconic in this novella. However, when read and seen as a painting of the Caribbean, it pours forth color and meaning in his most poetic way.
