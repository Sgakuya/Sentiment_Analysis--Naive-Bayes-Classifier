People need to stop hating on this girl. She is a great actress. When she first came on the show she wasn't good at all, but she has really grown as an actress. I think the only reason people don't like her is because they like the old Carly(Sarah Brown) so much. Of course nobody is going to be better than Sarah Brown, but Tamara Braun does very good job at the role.
