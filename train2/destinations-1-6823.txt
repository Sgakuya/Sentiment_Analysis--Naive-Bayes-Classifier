Thankfully not orginally from Oklahoma, but have lived here for several years. Visitors who find the state friendly obviously don't recognize crocodile smiles. People here are unhappy and bitter; and the extreme emphasis on religion translates into the hypocrisy level being quite high. Business people watch your backs in this state! (You're safer walking down a dark alley, at night, in a big city, with money hanging out of your pockets.)
