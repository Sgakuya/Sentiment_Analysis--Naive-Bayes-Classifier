Smarmy and obnoxious. Acts as if he thinks he's God's gift to women. I'm sure a lot of women just eat that crap up, but those are probably the same women who were born on this planet but don't live on it. Thank GOD he wasn't in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. As much as I like the Harry Potter books and movies, I would have had to skip that one I'm afraid.
