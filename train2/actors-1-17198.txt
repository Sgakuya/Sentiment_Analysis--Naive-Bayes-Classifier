I'm sorry Tamara is no Carly, she never was and never will be. This is a new character, and she should've been kept interacting with Zander (Chad Brannon)and Jax (Ingo R.) those are men she had chemistry with. I was beginning to enjoy Carly in Early to Mid 2002 under Megan Mc Tavish's version, she was independent and starting her life over and making friends and connections outside of Sonny's Realm and it Worked! But putting her back into Mob Central and basically ostracizing her from any other relationships outside of Sonny, Jason, and Courtney has hurt the character and has not helped Tamara grow as an actress. I believe in time she would've gotten better, if she'd been allowed to stay bad to the bone Carly. But this version under the new writing team, well it's not working and in my opinion it's made Carly a one note character and Tamara stale. So its not all her fault ... but I still say she's better off playing light stuff, don't give her the heavy drama because I'm always left running cold.
