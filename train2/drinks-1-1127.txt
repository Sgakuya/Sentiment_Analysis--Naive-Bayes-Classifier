We call this junk Diarreah beer. Really awful and misleading. Pretends to be the real Blue. Well, the real Blue is Molson Stock Ale which is a lot better than this crap. Labatts is a cheap Southern Ontario copy of Pilsner beers. The Pilsner company should take them to court.. Avoid at all costs unless, of course you want to run to the bathroom all the time!
