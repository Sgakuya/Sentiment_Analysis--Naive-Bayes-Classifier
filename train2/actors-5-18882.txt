A detective must find a child killer in apocalyptic Europe. The ghost of a young girl haunts a major Danish hospital. A group of intellectuals pretend to be mentally handicapped in public. These are just a few of the plots that are explored in von Trier's films. I say explored because von Trier has proven time and again that he has the cojones to go where little or no other filmmakers dare to go. From his sepia colored Element of Crime to his most recent contribution, the dramatic musical Dancer In the Dark , he has always amazed and cofounded the best of them with surreal plots, exquisite direction, and ever changing style. This man seems to live by the Monty Python credo:'And now for something completely different!' Some people might find some of his earlier films, such as Zentropa, a little over stylized so von Trier has remedied this by creating, with Thomas Vinterberg, the Dogme 95 movement. (For those who don't know what that is: think of it as neo-realism on a higher scale of reality.) Owing to the Rules of Chastity , von Trier was required to make a film with little to no style and he passed it off beautifully with the hilarious and thought provoking The Idiots . Lars von Trier has not only proven to be one of the best directors to come out of Denmark nor one of the best in recent history, but as one of the most titillating and proficient directors of all time. A true genius!
