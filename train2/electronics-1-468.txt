Have an MFC 5100c and would not buy another. Had minor problems with print quality in the first year, but starting one week after the warranty expired have had lots of problems. The paper feeders (both original top-feed and paper feed in the back) jam fully 80% of the time. Goes through ink very quickly. It does interface with my Mac, which was the primary reason I got it. In future would spend a little more to get better quality.
