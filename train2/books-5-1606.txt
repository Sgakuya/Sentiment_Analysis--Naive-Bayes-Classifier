Bloom County was one of the best comics of all time. Now seems to be forgotten. I've been a comic page addict since I can remember and the best years were when we had Bloom County, Calvin and Hobbes, and the Far Side all in print. Now they're all gone. Pick up Bloom County Babylon for a taste of what once was. I wonder what Breathed is up to now-a-days???
