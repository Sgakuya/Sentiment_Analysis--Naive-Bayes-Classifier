97 Grand Ch.Laredo. Worst car I have ever owned. More maintenance than my previous Honda, Toyota and Mazdas combined. I'm on my 3rd water pump, 3rd CD player, 2nd radiator, rear bearings, plus multiple seals, gaskets guages. Front stabilizer bar went and almost caused a crash at 60mph with 2 kids aboard. The original was junk and apparently the parts are too. Wrote twice to Jeep with no response. Dealer was no help either. People with new Jeeps are taking a big chance.
