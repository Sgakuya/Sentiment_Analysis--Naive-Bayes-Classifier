I have been a fan of Sarrah Jessica's for years. I love knowing the fact that when she is acting she is a firm believer of certain rules. Like how she will never do any nude scenes, and she does what she always feels right in front of the camera. She has a great personality, hardly ever curses, a wonderful sense of style and no matter what you will always find her smiling, unlike most celeb's that after awhile the spotlight gets to your head. I think she is a role model for all women.
