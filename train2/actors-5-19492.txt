I had the pleasure of seeing Jerry Seinfeld in person last night in one of four shows he s doing in my city (two later shows were added due to the original two selling out so fast). He is absolutely hilarious and brilliant onstage. I laughed so hard from beginning to end that I worried I might be dripping eye makeup from the tears that had been streaming down my face more than once. The entire crowd left still laughing and repeating various parts of his bit on the way out of the theatre. If he brings his act anywhere near you and you enjoy good standup you will not regret the price of admission.
