Stunningly beautiful actress on two really good tv shows (Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its' spin-off Angel) who has shown remarkable dramatic and comedic talent. Her flair for one-liners, sultry looks, and perky charms mark her as one of the finest, and snuggliest, tv actresses around. The MooCOw really hopes she does not get stuck as a tv actress , and never get the chance to show off her skills in a great moovie role. Few Snugglebunnies come as cowplete as this former cheerleader - by all accownts, she is a super nice person as well! :=8D
