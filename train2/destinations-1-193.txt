I was there in April 2004. This is a horrible, horrible place. It has the worst air pollution I have ever seen. I was there 4 days and never saw a tree or bird! In addition to the 15 million documented population there are 4 million people living in the streets and shanty towns. They brag about their maglev train but you dare not drink the water. What a misplaced set of priorities!
