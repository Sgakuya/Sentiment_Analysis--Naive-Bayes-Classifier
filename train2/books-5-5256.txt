This book is basically written how Scottish people pronounce words - so its understandable that people might find it difficult to get into. This story is very gritty - I'd say more gritty than the film as there's more to it. It doesn't try to be hip, or cool concerning addiction to drugs, I think it tries to be honest without being patronising. I think some people think it is pro-drugs because thats one of the main themes of the story - shame they don't actually read the book or watch the film properly before passing judgement.
