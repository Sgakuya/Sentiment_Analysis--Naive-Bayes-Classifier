I give Johnathan Taylor Thomas five stars because he is a great actor. He chooses film roles wisely and has steered clear from raunchy teen comedy. So nobody has the right to say he can't act because he can! As for the stupid ignorant people who talk about his sexuality, whatta hell has that have to do anything with him being an actor? Mind your own damn business and get a life! Oh yeah, by the way, Calif Jenny can you say HOOKED ON PHONICS ?
