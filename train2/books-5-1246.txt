An excellent comic strip by any means. I love how all the animals are drawn with small eyes and minimal capacity for facial expressions, making them look far more apathetic and logical than their human counterparts. The very sight of a cynical cow is hilarious! However, my favorite strip would have to be the one where a worried looking man is sitting at his desk, with a malicious looking mallard staring at him from a far-off building. The caption reads Antidaephobia: The fear that somewhere, somehow, a duck is watching you.
