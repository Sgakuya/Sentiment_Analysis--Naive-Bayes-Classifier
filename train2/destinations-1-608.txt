OK, Kingston should not be a top-rated destination in the Caribbean. It is a pit. It is scary. It is dangerous. I was there for a couple of days for work, I was with Jamaican friends, and it STILL was the most threatened I have ever felt anywhere in the Caribbean or in Latin America. Walking down the street at night (once again, with Jamaican friends) shady people were literally running out of buildings to harass me. To try and sell me things, to beg from me, to yell s**t at me - not a fun place. I do not recommend a trip here unless you have some way of sticking out less than I did, or if you get off on danger tourism - Kingston is urban blight at its worst.
