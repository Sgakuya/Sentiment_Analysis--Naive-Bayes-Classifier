I have had friends and relatives who have worked for USBank, and they have been treated like office furniture: Easy to move out on a whim. My Uncle has had been told severaltimes in the last 5 years he will probably be laid off or let go, but so far has kept his job. I had a friend that lost her job in operations there when they did a big merger four years ago; she had been there for a long time, and they just let her go with a month's notice. They hadn't even completed the merger yet, so how would they know they wouldn't need her anymore? Her husband worked in IT and he and half of his staff were shown the door as well. A few monthes later they put up several postings, hiring for those positions. Mis-management in the extreme!!!! Don't give them your business, they are an unethical company.
