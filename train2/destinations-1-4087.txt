I lived here for two years before returning to my home town in upstate ny. While vegas may be one of the vacation capitols of the world, its one of the worst places to live. They have the highest suicide and the highest divorce rates in the country. As is porbably apparant by that statistic, the people in las vegas are all really miserable and all on prozac. The desert climate is overrated as well; the whole dry heat isn't bad is crap. Because it is a dry heat there is nothing green anywhere and it is very depressing. The sun shines all the time yes, but there are no trees, no grass, NO YARDS, The kids all play in the middle of the street. And then, when it does rain (which usually starts in November and ends in late January) it floods all the time. So yes, go to las vegas and have the time of your life, lose all of your money, and go home broke, just make sure you are out of there in a week, and NEVER move there.
