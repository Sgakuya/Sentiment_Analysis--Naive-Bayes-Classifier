UoP online is terrible! I was in it for over a year and had to drop due to personal problems. When I returned, I was told that due to my "extensive" withdrawls, I was not in an "academically eligible" position and I might not be able to continue. This was AFTER I had already completed 3 courses. They dropped me (unofficially) & then said that I could "appeal" & re-enroll. Are they nuts? Since I said no, they put on my transcripts that I was "academically disqualified" which totally screws me up on transferring anywhere else. When I asked that, the advisor told me that if I had appealled, I would have been "allowed" back in but since I didn't, well they had to note that. Absolute crock. Since I won't give them more money, they'll f**k me over totally. I look forward to hearing if I will be able to transfer to a real school in the fall. Oh, and those who say that no working adult can take regular college classes & work 40 hrs a week probably hasn't looked at a college schedule lately. Most schools have MANY night & evening coures, even courses online, which anyone can work into their schedule. Wish me luck.
