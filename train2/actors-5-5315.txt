robert downey jr. is a true positive talent in the acting field. the one thing that i love about his work is that he can ake the most DRAB character and pump it full of life. do you know anyone else who can do that?! i don't. being an aspiring actress my self, watching him on the screen, is like taking a class in acting every single day. he truly is an inspiration and i wish that those of you who only see him for his drug problems would get past that and see, truly see, his acting skills. peace love heather
