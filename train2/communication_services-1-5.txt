EXCEL is a company that searches for young college students to become sellers of a service that does not give you anything that it says it does. The 49.95 unlimited deal is NOT 49.95 you get hit with charges that you are not told about. I tried it out as a favor to a family member and not only do they have TERRIBLE customer service, I NEVER got a bill for 49.95 it was usually 20.00 higher and I got charged for dropping the call waiting answering service that was causing problems on my phone line. Terrible company and I would rather never use the phone again then use EXCEL.
