What a disapointing day! Arriving within an hour of the park opening up, the womens restroom/changing room was in complete filth. Looking as if it had not been cleaned in days. Not only was it disgraceful but the restroom stall doors did NOT have locks or closing devices to close the door because they were all broken. Your not allowed to bring in any kind of food. Not only was the staff not prepared for the crowds at lunch time but after waiting in line for over 25 minutes for a single hotdog for my son....it was 1/2 frozen on the inside!! Out of the 'food court' windows....only 4 were staffed and open, 2 upstairs and 2 downstairs. This was a weekday afternoon. I cannot imagine what the peek weekends would be like. Later about 3:30 pm it was time for a snack. Over by the funnel cake snack shack there are tables. One of the many tables in that erea which where clearly messy for some time (due to the lack of employees cleaning up the food area) this table had honey bees(atleast 30 bees) swarming around the mess left by people. I notified the employess emediately of the bees that it was a safetly issue that if there is a child that could be highly elergic to a honey bee sting they will be liable for the injury to the child., that they needed someone out there right away to clean up that mess. Not only did the employee look at me with the 'deer in the head light look' but also observed NOBODY'S concern for childrens safety with the honey bees, 45 minutes later the table was still a mess with the bees swarming around the table. I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK TO THIS PARK EVER!!!
