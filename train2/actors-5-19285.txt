Tom is the greatest both on and off the screen. Pure class. Can you say that about Rosie? She doesn't want anyone to have a gun except her bodyguards. What a hypocrite. It's a shame when political beliefs are the basis for a person's character, but I guess by the comments on this site it is a major factor. Go Tom!!!!!
