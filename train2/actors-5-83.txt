*Swoons* Wasn't Cary Grant just a treasure to look at? I mean, why can't men still wear suits and hats? Anyway, more to the point, Cary Grant was a fantastic actor with a commanding screen presence. It's just too bad that he never received the acclaim that he should have. I adored An Affair To Remember and even thinking back on Cary's subtle elegance and romance-book perfection makes me sigh.
