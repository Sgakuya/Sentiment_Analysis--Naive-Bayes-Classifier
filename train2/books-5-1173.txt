great stories, very funny, excellent drawing, and often insightful. No mystery why this is everyone's favourite! I don't think I'll lower the rating of the strip just because scumbags have ripped it off and put it on t-shirts, etc - cause that's not the strips fault, and really has nothing to do with whether the comicstrip was good!
