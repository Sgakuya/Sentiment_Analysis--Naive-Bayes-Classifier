Tom Selleck is without a doubt my favorite actor in Hollywood. His movies are great, but to me, that is just where the story begins. Tom has acted with real class time and again. For example when big mouth Rosie brought him on her show and set him up about the fire arms issue, Tom was outstanding and behaved as a true gent should. Further more, Tom seems to have his head on straight about politics. A quality that so many of our Hollywood Celebs have tossed aside. Finally! We have a true hero on the screen and off the screen as well. Tom you are the best!!!
