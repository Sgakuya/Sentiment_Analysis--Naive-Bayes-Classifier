Mark Wahlberg is AWESOME! He has come a long way since his days of rap...(which I did see him in person at the Jensen Beach Pineapple Festival in Florida). Not only does he have an amazing body which makes my heart do flip-flops but he has a great personality as well! I loved the 1996 movie Fear ...great kissing scenes!! Basketball Diaries has a great plot... The Perfect Storm was eye-popping, edge of my seat, can't take my eyes off of Mark. The Big Hit is a superb action flick, again Mark is all tongue with his kissing. I am anxiously awaiting the release of his new movie, Planet of the Apes !!! I think Mark is an ALL AROUND GREAT ACTOR...Also see other movies with Mark Wahlberg in it, like: Boogie Nights , The Corruptor , Three Kings , his first flick Renaissance Man , and Traveller . Keep on making the movies Mark!
