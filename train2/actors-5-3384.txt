As Indiana Jones and Han Solo he brought us more thrills and romance in just six movies than some actors do in a whole career. He has aged very well and continues to be a real star on screen. When he is on the screen the movie just seems to get better. I try to see everything he makes, and while I am sometimes disappointed in the movie, I am never disappointed in his performance. I hope he keeps going like the everready bunny.
