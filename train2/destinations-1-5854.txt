I moved to New Jersey from New York fifteen years ago. First, I lived in Essex County then I moved to Roselle in Union County. I have to say that my last move was like jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Roselle (as well as the rest of Union County) is a property tax trap! The town has a property tax scam going where people wishing to sell their property can have their tax rate rolled back temporarily until the house is sold. A year after the property is sold the new owner is faced with sticker shock when their property taxes are rolled forward to where it really should be. In the twelve years that I've lived in Roselle, I've seen my property taxes grow to 180% of its original value. Talk about inflation! Now to help pad their property tax income, the town is finding other ways to penalize homeowners. They have an ambiguous set of rules for garbage pickup that they provide to their citizens. If you become confused about the type of garbage that should be put out on a certain day, they'll make you pay for it dearly with a mandatory court appearance as well fines and court fees. What's more, they require that only certain forms garbage must be left in your backyard while other types of garbage must be placed in your front yard. The private garbage pickup service has to come into your backyard for certain types of garbage only. This extra service is obviously passed on to the taxpayer. The quality of public school education in this town is atrocious. Most parents I know are doing the same thing that I am doing. They are putting their kids in private schools outside of this town. Needless to say, the Board of Education is one of the burdens that the homeowner in this town has to carry on their backs by way of property taxes. The administration of this town is incompetent, inept and indifferent to its citizens. New Jersey is not a great place to live. Moreover, I vote Roselle to be the worst place in New Jersey to be a homeowner!
