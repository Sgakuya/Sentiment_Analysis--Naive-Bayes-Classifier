I'll start with the people. There isn't much of a middle ground. You're either an uppity snob or an uppity redneck. Either way, you're uppity, and I don't even know why. This place is the sphincter of society, all crap passes through here. And half the Richmond men that just read that comment got excited at the word sphincter. Why is this place the gay capital of the east coast? Sure we can't hold a candle to NYC or Boston, since they have tons more people, but we've got just as much gay per capita as they do. A bunch of artsy fartsies, everyone here should die. Yeah, I'm here too, I went to VCU, big mistake. What to do at night? Drink...and then...drink some more? cuz wherever you go, that's about all there is to do. Options for an average weekend? Go to a club, drink. Go bowling, drink. Shoot pool, drink. Go to Laserquest, drink? Actually, after bowling, you don't drink, because you don't have any money after bowling. What else is there to do here? Nothing. The education here is a little lacking also. I've met quite a few people here, and I haven't met any that have impressed me with their intellect. I can hardly hold a conversation with half of them. It's not like I talk about anything intelligent, they're just that dumb.
