I was recently offered a Natural Light while working the BBQ grill in the backyard. Apparently suffering from the August heat and smoke inhalation from the grill, I opened the can and took a swallow. WTF had I just put in my mouth? Save the pennies that this stuff must cost until you can afford to drink something enjoyable. Where's my Old Speckled Hen?
