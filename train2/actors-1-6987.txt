I am extremely disappointed in this man. Since he is not on the site as a political activist , I will have to rate him here. He is a good actor. He is not such a good representative. Here is a man who abhors the death penalty. No one who murders deserves to be killed by the state , he says. But then, the U.S. deserves the terrorist acts, which killed MANY people, because of our actions in other countries . So, I guess it is okay for foreign nationals to kill us in retaliation?
