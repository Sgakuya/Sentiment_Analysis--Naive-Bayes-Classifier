This is one of the worst strips around. When it's not corny, preachy, or saccharine, it's just plain annoying and redundant. The punchlines are not funny, and the whole family dynamic is so stereotypical and bland. This must be a strip for those who need humor that is so sanitized that it doesn't apply to the real world.
