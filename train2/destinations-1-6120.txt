I have a gay friend near London- teaches at a Community College- calls KY hillbilly hell- 'very redneck' he says and very backward. He has told me time and time again how he wants out. He says KY is filled with bible thumpers and slimy bigoted people. Gay bashing is common, as is racism and anti sementism- are we living in 2006 or 1850? Now we see why there is a divided USA- the 'blue coastal states of the northeast' upper mid west and the West coast- sadly to say KY and the rest really fit the bill as 'flyover states'.
