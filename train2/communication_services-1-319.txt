I have been having the same issues as I am sure most Bell Mobility Customers are having too! I work in an industry where we are governed by the CRTC and this sort of fiasco is inexcusable. I have recieved many bills lately not showing payments that have been made. When I have record the payments being made, and there is nothing worse than opening a huge envelope.. and I mean huge and seeing an amount owing close to $1000. I have been unable to cancel my service as it is impossible to actually speak with someone. And what really boogles my mind, is they actually have staff cold calling people to get service thru them. How I know this, is today my Mother received a call from Bell Mobility asking her to sign up. She then said to the person on the phone, my daughter already has a phone for her and me.. and she is very dissatisifed. the girl then acknowledges that they are having billing issues and some customers are being double billed. Now I have a weekend to look forward to.. NOT!! I will be going over my invoices for the past while and cross referencing with my call logs on my phone. And believe me i will be cancelling my service and will be refusing to pay for the penalty. I signed a contract and in my opinion the company has breeched the contract therefore i should not have to be penalized for their problems. I have also filed a complaint online with the CRTC and I urge more to do this. They should not be allowed to rape their customers of their hard earned money.
