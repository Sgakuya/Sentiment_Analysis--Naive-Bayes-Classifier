The Nokia 6185 (CDMA dual-band) is terrible. Why? Numerous dropped calls (not dropped phone), bad service (in and around a buildings with cell site), intermittant message notification, etc. Sprint has removed it from their portfolio. Cudos to Sprint for providing a good customer experience with phone issues. Just ordered a Motorola StarTac dual-band in hopes that the service will improve.
