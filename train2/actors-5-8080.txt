Katherine Heburn is one of the best. I absolutely love all of her movies, love her voice, her look, her moves - everything about her. She travelled to the beat of a different drummer and was her own person - way before it was the in thing to do. One of my favorites was The African Queen. Loved her with Spencer Tracy. There is no one like her and there never will be again.
