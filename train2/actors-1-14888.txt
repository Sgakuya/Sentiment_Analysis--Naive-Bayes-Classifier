Kathie Lee Gifford is equivilant to nails on a chalkboard, something rotting in the back of the fridge, stepping in a pile of dog doo. She is annoying, narrow minded, self absorbed and JUST WON T GO AWAY. Sure, ambition is a respectable quality..but she is too much. I agree with CastleBee..she should fade away and stay home with her kids. Pop singer. Not. Talk show host. Not. Actress. Not. Infomercial queen. Nope. Author, no thanks. Let's see Kathie, there isn't much left. Don't go away mad, JUST GO AWAY.
