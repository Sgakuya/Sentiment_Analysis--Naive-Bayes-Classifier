The U.S. government- the wonderful "institution" that it is, has turned to US Bank for handling it's child support payments-- what an assinine move!!! I have had my card for a total of one month and every time that I try to activate it I get a busy signal. I have been trying for a full week now, to no avail. Who was the brainiac behind this stupid move!?! For those people who would actually like to access their money, should I suggest filing complaints until a reliable bank is found. Here's the irony- the US Banks card for child support payments is called the ReliaCard- what a crock!
