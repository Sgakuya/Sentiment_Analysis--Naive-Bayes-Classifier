My interest rate on my CapOne card was recently jacked up from 3.9% to 27.99% (!!) When I called in to ask why, the gal told me "it's just something that Capital One does" -- and I use the quote marks because those were here EXACT words! lol I knew there had to be a reason, but she couldn't tell me what it was. When I asked for her supervisor, she said she didn't have one; when I asked for her name again, she hung up on me. Great customer service, huh! When I called back, they weren't able to see that anyone had accessed my account but did tell me the interest rate increase from about 3 to about 30% was due to two late payments in a 6-month period. It's true, I don't deny it. The first payment was ONE DAY late (for which I paid their $35 (!) late fee), and last months was't late, it was two weeks early. I'm cancelling my card this weekend when I transfer funds from investments to checking to pay it off.
