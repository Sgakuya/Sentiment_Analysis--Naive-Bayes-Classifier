I did not read this book until late in life. Im glad because I might not have appreciated it. The book manges to be stark, hilarious, and utterly tender at times. I find it vastly superior to Fitzgeralds semi-autobiographical Tender is the night, which though it contained the most amazing decriptions I thought most of the book tedious. Do yourself a favor read Gatsby.
