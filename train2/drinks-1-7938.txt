I found a fifth of Old Grand Dad on sale one day at a Rite Aid store in Los Angeles for $5.99! I thought, what a great buy! Like an idiot, I bought it and proudly sported in my bar for several months. Finally, I decided to take a belt of that great bargain whiskey. One sip cured me. Basically, it resembled turpentine. It was the worst liquor that I ever tried. Had I have had drank the entire contents, I am certain that I would have been able to use my liver as a door-stop. I do keep that same bottle or rot gut handy for those freeloading, deadbeat friends and relatives of mine that only show up thirsty and in need of a favor. Ha!
