I PURCHASED A STI MOBILE PHONE, SAMSUNG N440. NOT TOLD ON THE PACKAGING IT WAS A REFERB PHONE. THE PHONE IS DEFECTIVE, WHERE THE CHARGER PLUGS IN AND THE SCREEN FREEZES UP, DUE TO THE FACT I SENT IN MY RECEIPT FOR A REBAIT, THEY WONT REPAIR OR REPLACE THE PHONE NOW WITHOUT THE RECEIPT. DAMN THEY GET YOU DONT THEY.
