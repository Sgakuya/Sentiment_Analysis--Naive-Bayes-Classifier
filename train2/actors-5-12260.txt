I was actually offended by Islandgal's comments. As a biracial--half black, half mexican--woman, I KNOW you have absolutely no knowledge of our experiences and lives. Halle may look white -which is a tad on the racist side--but she is black and america looks upon her as a black woman, stereotyping and impairing her in numerous ways. She felt the need to rally for black america simply because america sees her as black and nothing else. She is talented and beautiful--one of the mose beautiful women in the world.
