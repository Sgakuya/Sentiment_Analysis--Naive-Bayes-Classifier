Elijah Wood is a very good actor, he deserves 5 stars!!!He also has beautiful eyes,....but that has nothing to do with how good of an actor he is. After watching The Lord of the Rings ,I was amazed how well he played the part of Frodo,...he was everything I had ever imagined Frodo to be.I assume being a character out of a book that is supposed to act certain ways is difficult. To pull that off is a sure way of knowing who's a good actor and who isn't, and by golly,..he is a good one!
