It would be a disservice to limit Alec Guinness' stature to his performances in 'Doctor Zhivago' (1965) and 'Star Wars' (1977) and 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980). Guinness was in a class of his very own about whose work this commentator feels privileged to acknowldege. Even to bring up an award winning performance such as in the very worthy 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (1957) or in lesser parts in 'Lawrence of Arabia' (1962) and 'A Passage to India' (1984) does not provide the whole picture. His legacy encompasses a diversity of roles that should include his parts in director David Lean's adaptations of Dickens' classics from 'Great Expectations' (1946) and 'Oliver Twist' (1948) to Christine Edzard's two-part 'Little Dorritt' (1987), through the Ealing comedies, 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' (1949), 'The Lavender Hill Mob' (1951), or in 'Father Brown - Detective' (1954), and 'The Ladykillers' (1955). In a light comedy such as 'The Swan' (1956), Guinness is the personification of highest breeding in a man of mediocre intelligence. Very especially, he was most memorable in 'The Horse's Mouth' (1958), 'Tunes of Glory' (1960) and 'Damn the Defiant' (1962).
