I really can't believe that Alec Baldwin really believes the crap that he spouts. Hey Alec, I have news for you, Bush was elected president, get over it!! And he has done a great job to boot. I will personally pay for a private jet to take you to exile in France, or better yet...how about Iran or Iraq, yeah, I'll really show you a totalitarian regime. If you think that Bush is intolerable, then you'll really enjoy the Middle East! Some of the stuff he says is so crazy that even Hillary Clinton can't back them. At a recent Democratic fundraiser in New York City, Baldwin was saying derrogatory things about President Bush; Hillary ignored it out of embarrassment of his stupidity. Baldwin is a hack and has-been who has quite a mean streak. I'm sure he would have stoned Henry Hyde had he had the chance. Alec, along with Bill Clinton, is the great protector of the constitution...Yeah right!!!
