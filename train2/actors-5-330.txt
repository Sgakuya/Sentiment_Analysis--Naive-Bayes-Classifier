William Holden was IMHO, the finest film actor of his generation.Bill was a very natural actor-always real and believable.Bill had the special ability to be able to seamlessly enter the heart and soul of his character and become that character on screen. Bill had a inate understanding of human frailty-'That for the Grace of God go I .Bill`s sensitivity, compassion ,and empathy which he brought to each of his roles is beautiful to watch.Bill so often conveyed a tenderness and human little boy lost vulnerabilty which was very touching. Bill had the mosy beautiful smile ever-filled with true, gentle sweetness.Bill was a dedicated wildlife/nature conservationist-the accomplishment for which he was most proud. Bill is no forgottten by those of us who admire his work both as an actor and as a conservationist.Welove you. Lorraine Chandler
