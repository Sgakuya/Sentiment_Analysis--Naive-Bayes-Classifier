Just a schmucky little pretty boy who appeals solely to 14-year-old girls and homos who have a predilection towards twinks. Has appeared in a cavalcade of movies that are the cinematic equivalent of horseturds. I actually saw one of his totally unremarkable performances and couldn't believe they would put someone so vacant and useless on camera. But, that's popular culture for you these days: people who can't sing, dance or act and look like they need a good bath become so-called stars, meaning they have a fan base that constitutes about 5% of the public. What a waste of everybody else's time!!!
