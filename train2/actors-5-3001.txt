Sean Connery has a character style he plays continually, and he plays it very very well. Like a fine bottle of wine or a handcrafted violin, Sean Connery continues to improve and hone that character he protrays so well so that with each new project it shines brighter than the time before. Some people say that he lacks overall acting ability because of his choice to play a specific type of character in all his stage and movie roles. That would be like saying that a bread maker is not a real bread maker because he doesn't make every type of bread. Sean Connery has been making movies since I was born and doesn't show any signs of quitting anytime soon. That is a good thing for the entire world as he is loved worldwide for his performances. As a male in my early 40's, I hope I look and talk as well as Sean does when I am his age. I didnt like his Bond movies as much as I like Brosnans Bond performances. Personal taste I reckon. Still I do not know of one male actor I would rate as highly as Sean Connery. My other male favorites include: Michael aine, Val Kilmer, John Travolta, Keanou Reeves, Antonio Banderas, and Harrison Ford. Sean Connery is a notch or two above them all.
