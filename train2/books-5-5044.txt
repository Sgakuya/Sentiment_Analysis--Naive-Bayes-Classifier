It's a book I keep coming back to. Ayn Rand's ideas are extreme but, whether you agree with her philosophy or not, her books force you to think about her ideas and define your own. I don't think I'd like a world as black and white as hers is, but each of us envisions a different Utopia. Most importantly, though, her writing makes me care about the ideas her characters describe -- care about them, and think about them.
