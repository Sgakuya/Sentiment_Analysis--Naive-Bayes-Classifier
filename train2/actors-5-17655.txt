Helena Cassadine, a woman of beauty, grace, poise, witty, humoress and evilly brilliant. She isa true Goddess and each day she appears on GH I am captured by all and who she is. Daytime never hadd a great villian a mother to love one son despise the other but we get it all in Helean. May seh forever be a part of GH without her who shall wreak hell in Port Charles?
