Steinbeck's classic story of the migration of poor farmers from the depression era Nebraska to California, and their treatment as third class citizens all along the way, is one of the most powerful moving books I've ever read. The hero of this book, Tom, is developed as a character with such skill and attention to detail that you feel as if Tom is your neighbor, your friend, someone you know intimately. This is a masterpiece-read it!
