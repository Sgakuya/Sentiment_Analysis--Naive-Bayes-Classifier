For a man that's been around longer than most you wouldn't know it to look at him. He's certainly aged well and why wouldn't he with that much mischeif in him. I would love to see him in more serious roles as I think that he does really well and could be as well recieved as Robin Williams. I would love to go shopping with him, I think that would be a blast and he would bring out the mischief in anyone I'm sure. As an actor and as a man I think that he sits high on the excellence shelf. Just love him and wish him all the greatest in life.
