I did not watch ER...I watched hER! Is that show still on? What would be the point now? I had never seen the show before when my sick girlfriend(sinus infection) was watching this show and asked me what I thought of the dark-haired girl. I stopped and watched for a minute. I told her that she wasn't crazy, that woman was indeed everything. I will come back and lower the rating if she isn't very good on the big screen...but I don't think it will be necessary.
