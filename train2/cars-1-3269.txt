Test drove one yesterday. Lots of strange noises around the dash area. Jeep's history of fit and finish are poor and seem to be the same with this vehicle. Why anyone would take a chance on buying a first model year Jeep product is beyond me. Check out edmunds.com They already have a thread in town hall called 'problems with Jeep Liberty'. The darn thing has only been out a couple of months. Shop smart.
