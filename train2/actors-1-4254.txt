Difficult to believe that such an unconvincing no-talent like this continues to get roles. He sucked in the Welcome Back, Cotter days and he hasn't progressed much since then. Every performance of his that I've seen, and we're talking about a dozen movies, was so poorly realized and shallow that I wanted to write him a letter suggesting some acting schools he should check out. Sings like a duck with hay fever and for all the talk about him as a dancer, he's really nothing to rave about. Really weak.
