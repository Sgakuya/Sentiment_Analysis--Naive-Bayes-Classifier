When my mother passed away I converted her Wells Fargo accounts into Estate and Trust accounts. Her estate is settled so I went in to close the accounts. No problem. The problem came less than one minute later when I tried to cash a $6 rebate check. Since I no longer had an account with them, they refused to cash the check! They had not even posted the account closure yet! They even acknowledged that they would have cashed the check minutes earlier if I had only done it first! All this over a $6 check--you can't buy advertising like that!
