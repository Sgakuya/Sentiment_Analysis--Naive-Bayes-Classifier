Now I will never own another Windstar. Am trying to trade mine off. I am also steering clear of all Ford products due to the bad experience I have been left with. Not only have we had the head gaskets replaced but the tramsmission went out at less than 55,000. The roof leaks from the rack. The brakes throw dust everywhere, and they grind constantly (even after multiple replacements) Just replaced the brakes foor the fourth time this year and ford says there is no problem. Also, at same time I had to have a $250 sensor replaced.
