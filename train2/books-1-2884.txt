I've studied this piece of trash, and I cant help but detect a strong anti-americanism in this book. Zinn seems to think the U.S. is responsible for the second world war. Why? Because we placed economic embargos! How hypocritical of a man who says war should be a last resort. Simply stated, in Zinns world (and unfortunatly many of todays college students) it's always Americas fault. America was worse than the Nazi's. We should negotiate with terrorists. Before 'fat man; was dropped on Hiroshima the Japanese tried to negotiate peace. Abraham Lincoln was a pro-slavery rascist. Sentencing murderers to 10 years is too brutal, prisons should be abolished. Capitalism is failing. Thats what you said 20 years ago! Howard Zinn should be listed in the halls of great liars. If you dont' believe me, try reading books by experts.
