Dr. Pepper brand soda is my least favorite type of sodas. The taste doesn't really make my taste buds sing unlike other soft drinks. The taste reminds me of some bitter medicine such as Robitussin, but sweeter. To make things worse, they had to invent diet, which just makes Dr. Pepper sound like Dr. Loser in my book.
