we have a 1999 ford winstar se. It has been recalled several times since we bought it new. It is still under warranty and the abs ring axle broke. I could barely drive the car and took it to the mechanic in town. He fixed it and I sent the bill to Ford. First, there was terribe customer service from the manager at the service dept and then he told me you will get no money from Ford . I will never buy another Ford as long as I live. This was the worse treatment I have ever received and they have lost a long time customer. DON'T BUY A FORD. ... WHEN YOU NEED THEIR HELP THEY TURN THEIR BACK..
