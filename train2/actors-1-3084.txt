I don't see what all the hype is about. Whether he can act or not, he's a real jerk who thinks he is God's gift to the world. He is arrogant and rude and self-absorbed. I think that makes him a really ugly person. He needs to grow up and realize that the fans are the ones who butter his bread. There are much better actors out there than him. He ought to thank his lucky stars that he's even got fans who buy his movies, go see his movies and have websites dedicated to him. He seems very unappreciative of everything, and seems to expect things given to him. I wish someone would bring him and his ego down a peg or two.
