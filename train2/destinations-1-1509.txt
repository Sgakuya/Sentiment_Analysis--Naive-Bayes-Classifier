Hahahahaha! Runaway inflation and devaluation of the cruzado?!? Don't think so. Carnival is too garish and outlandish. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janiero, where crime is rampant and murders of street children occur on a daily basis? Yeah, right. Sounds real attractive. They do have a cool statue of Christ on Sugar Loaf Mountain, though. Piranhas and tribes of Native Americans who wear thongs. Whoa. Culture clash here, folks. Portuguese?!? Heck, it's Brazilian Portuguese. FUTBOL? Hey, Brazil, it's SOCCER. Pronounce it the way it's supposed to be pronounced. Brasilia---a capital city in the middle of nowhere. Real cool. Gotta love AMERICA, BAY-BEE!
