US Cellular is NOT a company to do business wilth. They lie and cheat, and are hard to get hold of. They told us they would settle for an amount when the bill went up drastically. They were going to give us 90 days. They handed it over to a collection agency within 2 weeks and now we owe more than ever! They are rude and unethical. NEVER do business with them! do without before you get hooked up with that outfit.
