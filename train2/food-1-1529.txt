Rank, rank, rank! The Blow Pop is a horrifying confection. The combination of hard candy and bubblegum is an unfortunate one. Once the bubblegum is uncovered, it's studded with sharp bits of hard candy, and it's difficult to remove from the stick. When that task is accomplished, the chewer begins to grind hard candy into the crevices of his/her teeth- a most unpleasant sensation. Blow Pop flavors are awful, especially green apple. Even as a kid, I knew enough to steer clear of this disgusting treat.
