I grew up watching Sally Field on tv and I guess she grew up while we all watched. She was america's sweetheart and later she seemed like the sister to us all. I admire that she has always taken the high road when it comes to smut. She has never made a movie that I was ashamed to watch with my children. I hope she continues to make quality movies for a long time.
