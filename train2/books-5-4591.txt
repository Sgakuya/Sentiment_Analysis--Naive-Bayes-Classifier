Any book that instills a desire for me to write creatively and differently is of infinite value. Hunter Thompson is a genius, not anyone can withstand so many drugs at one time and be brilliantely poetic. He transports the narrative in your head, you feel like you are in Vegas, on this acid trip, feeling like something in you just needs to get out. This book is one of his most hilarious.
