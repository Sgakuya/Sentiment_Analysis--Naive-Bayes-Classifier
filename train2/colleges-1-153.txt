The MCM program at Franklin University in Columbus Ohio is absolutely awful. I would not recommend it to anyone. The classes are too much the same and taught by professors that do not really care and just want to make a fast buck at a second job. The career services is a joke. The entire program consists of annoying group projects. One particular professor ranks students in groups by his percieved importance of you job. The upper, middle and lower level students are all ranked together.What kind of learning environment is this? I came to school to learn from everyone? How can I learn from the higher level students if I never get the opportunity to work with them? The University does nothing to to foster unity or networking among students in the program. I wonder if professors even read the papers. Everyone typically gets an A just for showing up. There is an attendance policy in most classes but favored studens can often not follow the policy and still get an A.The whole thing is just a joke....choose a Real University and don't waste your money.
