::sigh::what can't you say about this amazing young actress who has allready won tons of awards not to mention allready 2 oscars at the young age of 25. She puts her all in to every role she plays and isn't afraid of what she will discover through doing that. I try and think who else could play the roles she plays and i come up blank. She plays her characters so well that you can't even imagine someone else being able to pull it off the same way. SHE IS AMAZING!!!!!
