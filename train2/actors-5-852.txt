One of the greatest living American actors. Excellent performances in The Godfather 1 and 2, and did his best in the seriously flawed third film. Also great in Dog Day Afternoon, and several others. Has made his share of bad films, especially recently, but what actor hasn't made his share of duds? The only thing that bothers me about him is that the older he gets the more he relies on shouting instead of speaking. It gets tedious after a while, but that's just a minor complaint.
