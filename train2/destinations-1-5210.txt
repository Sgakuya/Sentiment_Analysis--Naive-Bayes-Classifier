most people come here wanting to be an actress/actor and come out to be icky, mean,nasty, buttered up, washed up porn stars who get raped, conned, and get broke. that's california for you. also too dang expensive! a 1bed studio costs more than 1k in most areas/mo! I am in NC and get a very huge 2bed 2 ba 1155 sq ft aprtment for 680/mo! and who would live next to the most annoying people in the world... celebs!
