Florida is a state with many things that are diserable- a mild climate with little or no winter, some great beaches, and sparkling diamonds like south beach and regions south of St. Pete and Tampa that are idealic. It does however have high crime, increasing high costs, poor services and a at best a lackluster educational system. It seems if you are rich or have a great income you can live very well- if not, good luck.
