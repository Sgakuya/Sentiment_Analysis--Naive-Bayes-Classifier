I have had an account with this bank for six years. When they were First Union. I did not use checks or debit cards on my account from 2001 thru 2003. when I went to Iraq my husband received a debit card so that he could withdrawl my pay that went into the account. He was the only one using the account and we did not have allot of bills due to him living with our daughter. When I came home from Iraq we decided to rent a house and I had the bank give me a debit card. We did not want checks and I figured they would not let me take out what I did not have. that was always my understanding of check and debit cards. Boy was I wrong. It took me till a month and a half ago to realize that all of the charges that I have been paying were not my fault. they have a policy that when checks and debits come in they will pay the highest first and then go down the line. This allows them to charge you 30.oo for each small debit transaction that they choose. In one month I forgot about a 200.oo debit that was set for the 15th of the month and was charged over 300.oo for each debit transaction that had come in before the 200.oo. This is just one instance of the hell I have had to deal with. I could go on forever. The bank policies are terrible. The only way to save money is for me to close my account and put my money under my mattress, but of course I must have a bank account by Army policy.
