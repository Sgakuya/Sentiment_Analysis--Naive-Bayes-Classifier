Simply put, Bobby is the man. He deserved Oscars for The Godfather 2, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, and Awakenings, but only won for two of them. Sadly, today he's letting his career go to waste by starring in bad comedies and crime flicks. Still, because of the past, he gets 5 stars.
