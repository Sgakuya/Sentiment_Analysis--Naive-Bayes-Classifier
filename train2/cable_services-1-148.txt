Direct TV is about the worst company I have ever had the dis-pleasure of dealing with. I had to re-schedule a local channel upgrade 5 times, and they did nothing about it. Then when I moved I again had to re-schedule the install over 2 days and about 20 phone calls! but this time they offered a free DVR, big deal I already had one. Then I recieved a large bill and less than a week later they cut off my service saying I did not pay. It is hard to pay a bill I just received with errors, what do they expect a Fed Ex overnight? Then I wanted to discontinue my service from so many mishaps and they said I was gion to be charged 150$ for early termination. Whew.. thats about it, I may be an extreem case but I will never get direct tv or recommend direct tv to anyone, EVER
