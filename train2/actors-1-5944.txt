I don't rate appearances, because I'm no 10/10 myself. Granted, this man doesn't turn my engine on. He is the personification of the Hollywood machine. Polished image, film choices based on financial gain, faux-people friendly personality. And I am getting annoyed with people like Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson, bombasting society with their religious doctrine. Hey Tom, I am not going to join your little cult just because you say it works! You're an (charlatan) actor, Mel Gibson's an actor. Stay in those boundaries and stop providing social commentary in areas no-one wants you to.
