Hands down the worst squeeb I've ever smoked. I would rather smoke Bill Cosby's tube steak than smoke a Marlboro Light in my worst craving. Why smoke if you smoke such feminine cigarettes? You will die from smoking if you smoke too long, so why not enjoy the cause of your inevitable death? They have little to no taste, absolutely no rush of nicotine, and a white filter! I liken these cigarettes to throwing crap on the wall and staring at it until you can quit chiefing squares. Smoke Kamel Reds. Dammit.
