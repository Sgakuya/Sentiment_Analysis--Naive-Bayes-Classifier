Most people don't realize that he was a very short man. I believe he was somewhere between 5' 2 and 5' 4, according to which biography you read. He wore platform shoes to add to his height on screen. He still scared me nearly to death as a child watching the old horror flicks. I would nearly strangle my teddy bear when I watched them. What fun!
