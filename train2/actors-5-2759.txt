Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of our time. He can play any role and do so stonrly and commandlingly. He is articulate and eloquent and steals every scene in which he acts (unless he is not supposed to, in which case he blends in masterfully). There are not enough good things I can say about Kevin Spacey. If you liked him in American Beauty, I suggest seeing him in Seven is you want to see a different side, or in The Usual Suspects (for which he won his first oscar) if you just want to see a superb performance. Fans of Kevin Spacey should check out Swimming with Sharks if you haven't already. He's incredible in it and has a fantastic monologue at the end.
