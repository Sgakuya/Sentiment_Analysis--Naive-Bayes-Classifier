Aw ha, aw ha. The best strip of all time. I think Bill Watterson was a genius at making this strip. They should make this comic into a movie directed by Waterson! If he does that will be unbelievable! you agree email me on my user name. Life now's pretty boring without him. WE MISS YOU CALVIN & HOBBES!!! 1985-1995.
