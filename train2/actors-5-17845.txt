Not since Linda Dano have I loved a character on a day time drama, just the right amount of humor and kitch, intelligence/curiosity going to the edge of ridiculous without stepping over the line. She relates and interracts with Timmy so well that sometimes I wish I had a doll that came to life, could you imagine the trouble you could get into if we all had one? Cudo's to Ms. Mills (Mrs. Caulifield) on her wonderful performance, she should be nominated for a Daytime Emmy next year!
