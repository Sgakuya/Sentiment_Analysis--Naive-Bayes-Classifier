Nas-tee! If you're hungry for chips, you may as well go all out for taste and texture. These pathetic substitutes will not only fail to satisfy my chip cravings but they have so much junk in them they aren't about to help my health concerns either. If you're going to leap off a cliff at least make it high enough to give you the feeling you're flying!
