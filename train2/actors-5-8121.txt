This woman was a powerhouse of talent! She redefined Movie Star with her eccentric beauty and fearless determination. Some classified her Bitch, because she stood up for what she believed in, I classify her as one of the stepping stones to what women are today. My Favorite movie is ALL ABOUT EVE, I bought Bette's portrayal of Margo, insecure, frightened, and fearless all wrapped up into one complex character that you couldn't help but root for!
