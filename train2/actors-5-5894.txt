GREAT actor, with diverse roles. I like his politics too. He has every right, like anyone else, to speak out against our policies, the President, etc. In this case, he happens to be correct about the idiot savant Bush! Bush IS the worst President we've EVER had, and a DISGRACE to moral, educated, and aware Americans everywhere. The Iraqi invasion WAS WRONG, and a dark chapter in our history. We continue to kill innocent victims to this day, as we just bombed a village in Pakistan and killed women and children to try to get to Al-Zawahiri. Nice going moron!
