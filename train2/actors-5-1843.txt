He's a great actor who doesn't get the appreciation he deserves. He has such range. I liked him in Chocolat and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and I would like to see him in Once Upon a Time in Mexico too. UPDATE: I know this is going to sound shallow, but I think Johnny Depp looks great now that he's cut off all that hair and has gone back to a more clean-cut look. Now we can see his pretty face better.
