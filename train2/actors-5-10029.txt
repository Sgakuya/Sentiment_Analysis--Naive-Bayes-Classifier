Jamie Lee Curtis is Fantastic! How can anyone not like her! She is a brilliant source of entertainment, she made us all laugh in Freaky Friday, True Lies and many more. I can imagine her being a great mum! well it seems she is because i saw clips of her on the red carpet with her daughter and the interviewer asked Annie if she was a gd mum, and she sed brilliant. She is also very beautiful and Christopher Guest is a lucky man. I hope 2 c more of her cos she is just the ultimate Hollywood beauty! as well as the ultimate hollywood actress! love ya jamie!
