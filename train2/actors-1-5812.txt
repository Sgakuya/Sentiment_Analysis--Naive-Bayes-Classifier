Faggy dwarfy talentless little shrimp whose sole appeal is to prepubescent teenboppers who aren't threatened by his sexual aura, which is, by the way, nonexistent. Amazing they can make a star out of such a zero, but it appears he's already reached his zenith and is on the way down. Disposable celebrity for a disposable American popular culture.
