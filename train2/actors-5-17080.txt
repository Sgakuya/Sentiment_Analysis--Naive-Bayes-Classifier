Nancy Lee Grahn is an asset to the daytime genre, she and MB kept me coming back to GH early last year, even when I wasn't a full time viewer and the chemistry she shares with the entire cast of General Hospital is amazing. But it was her incredible chemistry with Maurice Benard (Sonny Corinthos) that got me hooked on the show full time... I am now a GH viewer and I look forward to the day that the writers continue the untold love story of the lady lawyer and her mobster client ... these two actors bring out the best in one another and I miss the friendship and close relationship of Alexis and Sonny. Nancy has the ability to make a viewer relate to the character of Alexis Davis, she's funny and smart, and talented, strong, loving and gentle, she's also insecure, fearful, stubborn, private, and vulnerable and that's as real as you can get to life ... no matter how strong a woman is, we each have an insecurity that plagues us, and Alexis' happens to be her love life... she doubts her worth and it's so real that I feel for the character and Nancy portrays it with such conviction that I begin to get lost in Alexis and that my friend... Is talent!
