Cingular is nothing but shoddy buisness practice. Once, when at one of their stores, I changed to a larger plan and initiated a text-message plan, and the salesperson said that he couldn't give me a reciept. Consequently, the larger plan didn't go into effect, my bill was $300, and there was nothing I could do about it! I never have reliable reception, my phone malfunctions all the time (they tell me I have to renew my contract in order to get a new phone), and I've never encountered such dilenquents as when I tried to get something from their 1-800 number. I HATE CINGULAR!
