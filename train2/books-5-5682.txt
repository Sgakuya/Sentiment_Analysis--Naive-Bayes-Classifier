These are absolutely brilliant. Detailing the later life of Harry Flashman, the bully of Tom Brown's schooldays who goes on to a celebrated career as a soldier and adventurer in Victorian England, the ten books are among the most entertaining works of their type around. Fraser has a brilliant gift of language and narrative, with a voice of sardonic humour, and the books are meticulously researched.
