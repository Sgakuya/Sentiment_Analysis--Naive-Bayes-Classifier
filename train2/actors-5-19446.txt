Jason Alexander's character, George, on Seinfeld is one of the funniest television characters of all time. His loser image generated bizarre, hilarious situations week after week. One of my favorite episodes was when George decided to have his desk remodeled so that he could nap underneath it. What about the time he pretended to be a marine biologist and saved the beached whale by removing a golf ball from its blowhole? Classic Costanza (can't stand ya)!
