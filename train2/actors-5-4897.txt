Wow...what acting! Hell, what abs! Christian Bale has come a long way and I am personally so proud to have followed his career for a long time. He is a great actor and you should definatly check out a movie or two. I mean, you can always do what I do, and own them all! My personal picks are Newsies, All the Little Animals, American Psycho, Velvet Goldmine, Little Women, but you can't really go wrong with a Christian Bale flick!
