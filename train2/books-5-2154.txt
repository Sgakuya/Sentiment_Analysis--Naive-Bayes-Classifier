This strip is much better than most of the junk on the comics pages nowadays. It's actually funny, which is more than I can say for most of them. And geez, Calvin Hobbes, Far Side and Bloom County aren't even around any more. Peanuts are reruns and Dilbert, well... Spooner makes me want to read the comics again.
