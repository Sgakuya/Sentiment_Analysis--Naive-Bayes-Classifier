Heh, what was so great about him? I recently saw Annie Hall, and that was just...OK, yet everyone once thought that was just so brilliant. I would put him in the Wus Hall of Fame if he didn't have some matzos and left Mia for that cute Korean girl. Probably a much better comedy writer than an on screen presence.
