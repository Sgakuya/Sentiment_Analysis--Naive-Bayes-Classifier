He is a great role model, because he is one of the only actors in Hollywood who speaks a non- popular conservative opinion, not to be brash, but because he really belives in morals and individual freedoms. His good hearted purity always comes through in all his movies, and he is a shining example of what family values should be like in the show biz world, and to the rest of the world. He is truly an icon!
