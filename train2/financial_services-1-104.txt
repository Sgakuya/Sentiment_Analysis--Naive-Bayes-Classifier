When I was a Wells Fargo customer I was told to keep my account number with me as they needed it incase the computers went down. I have banked at several other banks and have never heard of such a thing. Also they were able to cross our account with some one in another state. There were huge lines and the place was just a mess. If you burp in the building they want 25 cents. I would never recommend Wells Fargo to my worst enemy they are terrible.
