Mrs. Mike is one of those timeless treasures you read and never forget. I read this book about 40 years ago, searched for a copy for over 20 years, and now I own several copies. Seems like every time someone sees my collection of Mrs. Mike, she says Mrs. Mike...I remember that book from years ago... and so I send her home with a copy. My child read this book and plans on passing it on also. Mrs. Mike is the story of Katherine Mary Flannigan, who for health reasons, moves to the Canadian wilderness with her uncle in the early 1900's. There, she meets Canadian Mountie, Mike and marries him. This story is one of trial and triumph, hardly imaginable in today's age, but unforgettable. By the way, this book is recommended for males too.
