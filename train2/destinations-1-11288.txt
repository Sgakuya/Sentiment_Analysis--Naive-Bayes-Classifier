Mr. MacPherson is 100% right...NYC is a terrible, TERRIBLE place to be taking your family. Both my parents were killed there while minding their own business and my little boy was hit by a crazy driver who was doped up on some street drugs he'd just bought. Never will me and mine be returning to that filthy town!!!
