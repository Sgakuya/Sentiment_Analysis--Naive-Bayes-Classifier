I've never seen any of Evan's previous films, in fact the first time I saw her was in Thirteen. Critics were raving about Holly Hunter's performance in the film and don't get me wrong she was good, but the person who held my attention was Evan Rachel Wood. I thought she did an excellent job playing a teenager who succombes to peer pressure and growing up too fast under the influence of popular girl Evie and wanting to be liked, respected and seen as a sexual desire. Her transition from good girl to bad was excellent. There are many young actresses who have portrayed teenagers in their own unique style, sometimes not sincere enough. Evan played Tracy so well, quite possibly one of the best performances depicting a rebellious teen.
