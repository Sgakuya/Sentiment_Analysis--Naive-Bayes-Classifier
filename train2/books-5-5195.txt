Memoirs is one of my top 5 books I have ever read. My friend and I got so into this book. We would talk about it everday at work and we would get excited about reading more that night. It was strange how into I got. It took me a good 50 pages to get into it, but after that, I was hooked. It is also educational because you learn about a lot about Geisha's and the culture that surrounds them.
