Bette Davis was the greatest! I'd like to give her more than 5 stars. She could play any role and wasn't afraid of the non-glamorous roles, remember Of Human Bondage ? Whoever rated her a one star doesn't know great talent when they see it. I see they didn't leave a comment. I agree with Cebra totally.
