I picked up a copy of Skipping Christmas to read on an airplane last week because I can't concentrate very well when I'm traveling and John Grisham's writing is usually very engrossing and easy to digest. (Plus, the book is fairly small and lightweight, and it was discounted 30% at Barnes and Noble.) Anyway, it was a HUGE disappointment. Grisham takes a pretty good idea (what happens when a couple decides to opt out of Christmas one year), and he ruins it through a flat storyline, a lack of character development, incredibly annoying characters (maybe it was a good thing that they weren't fully developed), terrible dialogue, and a trite, predictable ending. I was so bored with the book, I ended up scanning the last third and I contemplated leaving it in the pocket on the seat in front of me. If there's one thing you should skip this Christmas, it's Skipping Christmas!
