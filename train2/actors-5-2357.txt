Mel Gibson is probably the most underrated actor of all time. Putting his good looks aside for the moment, what actor can carry off the divergent roles as perfectly as he can? From an American Colonialist to a priest to a playboy etc..etc...WOW. Couple that with his masculine good looks, his family commitment and values and yes, he is what women want and men admire.
