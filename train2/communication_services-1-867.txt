My husband drives transport throughout USA.&Can.He purchased a Telus mobility plan 2 months ago.Due to the expense of transport breakdowns.We where finding it just too expensive.My husband found it didn't work in many areas.Anyway,when my husband phoned to cancel the service.He was told he would have to pay a cancellation fee of $660.00 Until he decides what he is going to do?He can suspend the service for a fee of $10.00 per month.Which could go on indefinetly.Until he pays the cancellation fee of $660.00.Or he finds someone to take over the service.Who would want this?Telus has a license to rob.Stay away from them,they are underhanded.Need to be investigated.Perhaps if enough of us complain,they will be.
