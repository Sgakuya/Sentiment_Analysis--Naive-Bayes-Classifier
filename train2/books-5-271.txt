If you don't know anything about Richard Burton, do yourself a favor and read this book. He was a 19th century English explorer, soldier, linguist, and just about everything else you can imagine. One of the best parts of the book is the story of how Burton became the first Christian to travel to Mecca as a native. What kind of balls would you have to have to pull that off?
