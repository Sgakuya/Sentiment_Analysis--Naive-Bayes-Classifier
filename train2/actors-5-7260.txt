Gorgeous, wonderful, talented actor, and one of my all-time favorites. He chooses very diverse roles, many of them challenging. He was excellent in Charlotte Gray opposite Cate Blanchett, as well as Big Fish in the role of William Bloom. He has an interesting style that is entirely believable, and he deserves a lot more recognition than he currently gets.
