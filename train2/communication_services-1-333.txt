US Cellular overall sucks! I have used them for 2 years and am really ready to get out of my contract! Their customer service people belittle you and are terribly rude, I had a woman hang up on me when they disconnected my service after I made payment arrangements, I told her I had made arrangements and demanded they reconnect my service, she stated if you are going to make demands i cant help you and hung up on me. They make Ameritech look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook farm!
