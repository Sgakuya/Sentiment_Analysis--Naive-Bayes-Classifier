Braun's self-satisfied personality has taken over the character of Carly. The character has no humanity anymore. Braun can not play subtext. She cannot show conflicted emotions. She reads her lines, and messes up a lot of them anyway. She makes me crazy with Okay, you know what? She overacts in the dramatic scenes. She can't cry. She isn't a sexy vixen, like Carly should be. She brings nothing to the table. Plus she's oddly double jointed and her spastic movements are gross.
