Stephen Nichols is the best actor I have ever seen on screen or stage. I would watch him anywhere, any time, any stage, any channel, any screen. He can play ANY emotion, and do it convincingly, while stealing your heart away. Most importantly, he cares about doing the best job he possibly can. He should teach acting or be the standard by which other actors model their own work.
