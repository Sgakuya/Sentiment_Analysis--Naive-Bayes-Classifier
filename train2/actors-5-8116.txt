Bette Davis is my all time favorite classic actress, and my favorite movie starring her is Jezebel . I always looked up to her when I was younger because she spoke her mind. I was very shy, and she was inspiring! I hppe girls today will look to her as a role model. She has more to say than Brittany Spears or Christina Aguilera, and she says it better!!!
