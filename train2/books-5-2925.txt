This is the shortest book that I have read by King and it could very well have been stretched further. I love the concept of the book and that Carrie was able to exact her revenge. I do feel she went a tad overboard but then I don't think she had all her marbles anyway. I loved the way the book was written and the way it darted around and read it all in about four hours.
