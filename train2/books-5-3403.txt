Bill Watterson named this book, a compilation of previously published Calvin and Hobbes books, indespensable, because he thought it was totally unneccessary. However, it's a better choice than buying its component books separately. It's cheaper, it has color Sundays, and it includes a bunch of excellent bonus work.
