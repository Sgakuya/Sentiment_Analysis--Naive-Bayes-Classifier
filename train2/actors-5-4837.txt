Not only a marvelous actor, but a very attractive, down-to-earth man, as well. He was fabulous in Cold Mountain (and I was really rooting for him for the Oscar) and even better in Enemy At The Gates. Jude has a rather self-effacing charm that is extremely attractive, and he can play a rough and rugged soldier or a sweet and sensitive love interest with perfection, not to mention with equal ease. One of the best actors in Hollywood right now, Jude Law is finally gaining the attention he deserves.
