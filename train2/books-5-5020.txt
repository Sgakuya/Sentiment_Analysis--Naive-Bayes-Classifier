Wow, how sorry I felt for Oliver when the host family in London didn't want him anymore! When I read it, I felt like if I was living in the 17th century, or was it the 18th [?], myself! It really touch you! :o) Not long time after I read Tom Sawyer expected the same out of that book. I was so dissappointed! I still doesn't know if it was because of the amazing Oliver Twist or if Tom Sawyer really was a bad book...
