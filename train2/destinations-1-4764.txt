Beautiful surroundings but the town seems really creepy when you think it is run by such a powerful, wealthy and tight knit group. Overall, I was very unimpressed with this place. For my travel money, the Mormons can keep their strange little town and hideously ugly Salt Lake, which, from what I observed, is nothing more than an oversized cesspool.
