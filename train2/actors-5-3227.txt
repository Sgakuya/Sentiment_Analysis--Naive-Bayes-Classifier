Onscreen charisma, Reigna wrote, and that really nails it. No film with Steve in it is a complete and utter waste of space (though Escape from LA comes close). He is a great actor but it's more than that which makes me want to see everything he's in, it's just that when he comes on screen you get a smile which doesn't leave until he does. And for anyone who's only seen him in nervy/psycho criminal roles I recommend looking up Parting Glances(wipes everyone else off the screen),In The Soup, Living In Oblivion,Ghost World and Trees Lounge
