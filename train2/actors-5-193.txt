I was really sad to hear of his death when I turned on the news this morning - so many really wonderful movie memories. Jack Lemmon was a great actor and his death is an enormous loss for the entertainment world. Looking back at his immense and varied collection of work it is obvious from the start that he would become one of the most well loved and unforgettable talents in his field. His energetic brilliance and incredible range as a performer made him and enduring star of comedy, drama, stage and screen. While his roles and characterizations ran the gamut - sometimes funny, sometimes sad or at times even disturbed - they always had one factor in common - the very deep and real humanness he was so adept at conveying. I can't ever remember a time in my life when I did not consider myself a fan of this man's work and in awe of his gift for acting. He was a truly remarkable person who will be well remembered and sadly missed.
