Could I give MCI a zero, please? I was generally satisfied with MCI's service until one point when they changed their service plans. Rather than using any logic to assign me to a plan which would result in low billing costs, they automatically assigned me to a new plan (running under the same name?!?) which increased my off peak rates 5x and peak rates by 6x. If they had notified me and I had failed to select an appropriate plan, this would have been my fault. However, the first notice I had came with a monthly bill 4x what my normal bill was. After several calls to customer service with no resolution, I was forced to go to the BBB to get a refund from MCI. They have since offered me rates comparable to or ever so slightly lower than my current service, but I refuse to go back to a company with such a poor excuse for customer service.
