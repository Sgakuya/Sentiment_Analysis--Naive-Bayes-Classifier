Isn't this state an extension of Maryland's eastern shore? The 'Ware isn't the most hip-hop happenin' place, but it isn't attractive, friendly or interesting in the least. Rehoboth Beach is nothing special; plenty of better seaside communities nearby. Wilmington and vicinity seems like the Philly metro's bastard son, though it's probably convenient to better cities. South of Wilmington, most of the state leaves me with the impression that this is a place of farmlands connected by produce stands and big box retailers.
