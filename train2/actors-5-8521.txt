Truly great actress of stupendous depth and sensitivity, elegance and dignity. Great performances in From Here to Eternity, Separate Tables, The Charlk Garden, and Night of the Iguana. OK, she didn't sing in The King and I, but many other leading ladies of her day were dubbed by Marnie Nixon (N. Wood, A, Hepburn, and D. Dandridge, I believe).
