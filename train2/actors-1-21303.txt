If it weren't for her stupid face she'd be absoloutely nowhere. It was looks and money that got her where she is today. The little blond doesn't even know her way around a single instrument or any kind of music writing. For those of you la-dee-da duff-lovers who claim she has so much talent, well you are just idiots! Screw talent, she has none of it! I'd rather listen to my own singing in the shower, but of course I'm not where she is because I'm not rich and my parents didn't put me into a movie when I was nine years old! If you want to listen to that crap then fine, but please stop talking about her being a talented singer. I could throw up every time I hear someone raving about her. As for me, I'll just sit back and laugh as she turns into a slut with too much money, like Britney Spears, and people lose interest. And for those of you who call me and others jealous because we see what a faker she is, what the hell do we have to be jealous about? Blond hair?UPDATE TO BABY SPAG: Sorry dear, I don't do chatspeak.
