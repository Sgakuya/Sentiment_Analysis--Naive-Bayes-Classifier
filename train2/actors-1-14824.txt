When I heard about Jennifer L pez I said: Good! Another latin girl!! When I saw her act(and heard her sing! ugh!)for the first time, I said: God, why you do this to the people? Why you didn't give to this girl at least a little bit of talent?!!! You can't imagine how much I've cried for her... poor, poor gal!!! @=(
