I live and die by my internet connection. Work from home and must have reliability and support for complex home LAN. If this is you also, stay as far away from Adelphia as possible. My biggest grip, besides the 8 hours of down time after a power outage once because "it is just cable", is the fact that you cannot setup a dualboot system. Why? Any reasonably competent tech person would understand. They attempt to register the mac address somehow automatically for every new computer in your LAN. This means you get the red Adelphia screen of death every time you try to access anything on the internet. I cannot tell you how much I loathe their service. In 15 years as an internet/broadband customer from services all over the country I have _never_ had such a horrible experience. I don't normally take time for this sort of review thing, but I absolutely had to in this case. Stay away from Adelphia. I am switching to DSL and taking the bandwidth drop just because of these troubles. BTW, I have two xp systems, a mac (osx), and a linux fc3 box (that dual boots into xp).
