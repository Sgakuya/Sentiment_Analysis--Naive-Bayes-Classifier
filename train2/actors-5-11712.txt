I completely fell in total love with Renee Zellweger the first time I saw her on screen. I've never been so captivated by any other living human being. She is 100 percent perfection in every way. I have thought about her every single day since the release of Jerry Maguire. Hopefully one day I will get my ultimate desire and meet her. Until then, I shall have to watch her movies and continue to dream.
