Lucille Ball is one of the funniest women on TV & if anyone has any doubt of her being a great actress ask anyone who knew or met her who could tell you that the real Lucille Ball was nothing like her wacky, goofy, fun-loving alter ego, Lucy Ricardo. In real life (from all ive heard & read about her) she was pretty grim, very serious & not always the nicest person to deal with, nevertheless its her comedic gifts & legendary TV show that she will always be loved & remembered for!
