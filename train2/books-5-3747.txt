To Kill a Mockingbird offers a very poignant view of racism in Alabama during the 1930's. It's a classic story in which Harper Lee brings all the characters to life, specifically Atticus. His defense of the poor black man in the courthouse is simply powerful. It comes across very well in the old black and white movie about the story. Read the book; although it is fiction, it accurately portrays the position of blacks in the south before the Civil Rights Movement.
