Some sodas were just not meant to be caffienated... citrus sodas are one of those types. It seems like it wants to be Sprite, or even 7-up, but it comes not even close as far as taste go... and if you just drink it for a caffiene buzz, there are better tasting drinks to get that buzz from (like Coke or Barq's root beer).
