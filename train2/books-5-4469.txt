Classic love story. A combination of Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast. Most females can relate to Jane's plain features. There are vivid descriptions of horrible conditions at orphanages. Minimal French is needed to understand some pages (conversations with Adele). Not the typical happy ending but it is predictable nonetheless.
