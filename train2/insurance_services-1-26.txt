State Farm was rude, unhelpful, and most importantly unfair in handling my claim last year when I was hit by an uninsured and unemployed motorist and my very unique and not replaceable car was totaled. * additionally, they tried to defraud me when I bought a disability policy, but much later when they mailed me the policy with several inserted pages I'd never seen with statements checked off (supposedly by me, but later State Farm admitted by them) I did complain within the 10 days noted in small print and they refunded my money. Buyer beware.
