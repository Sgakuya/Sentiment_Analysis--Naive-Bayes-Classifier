It takes a lot for me to say a cereal is disgusting but this is just...urgh! You can see a layer of fat forming on top of the milk as soon as it is poured! The peanut butter taste? I'm not sure where its coming from but it ain't from peanut butter. This tastes like it came right out of a radioactive chemical plant and it gets really mushy real fast...don't even bother, go to Peanut butter Cookie Crisp or even better Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch (truly amazing)
