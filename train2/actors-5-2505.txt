Not as big a pop culture icon as a DeNiro, Nicholson, or Cruise because they often essentially play themselves. Dusty is the best pure actor of his time. His two greatest scenes take place at crosswalks. Ratso Rizzo's I'm walking here! and Rain Man's stopping in the middle of traffic when the sign changes to don't walk.
