Hayley Joel Osment is a true inspiration to young people like myself everywhere. He has proven that dreams do indeed come true. I admire him for not letting his much-deserved success go to his head. He was phenominal in The Sixth Sense and definately made that film the success that it was. However, my favorite of his few films is Pay it Forward . The latter film was truly an inspiration in which he gave an excellent and moving performance. Let's not forget his small but memoriable role as Forrest's son in Forrest Gump . Hayley Joel Osment is a wonderful actor with a very supportive family, which gives me hope that he will not experiance the same career downfall that McCauley Culkin experianced in the 90s. Both Culkin and Osment are great actors, but the latter has the advantage of not having greedy parents at the helm.
