I think Richard Gere is the most pathetic piece of humanity since Benedict Arnold. In fact, I consider him a traitor with his pacifist comments during this time of war. A war, I might add, that we did not start. But we must stand up and fight back. I think this dirt bag needs to go live in the Middle East. I sure wouldn't miss him. He makes me sick to even look at him. Ugh------no wonder Cindy Crawford found her a real man to be the father of her children. No body wants a wimp.His movies will no longer play in our house.
