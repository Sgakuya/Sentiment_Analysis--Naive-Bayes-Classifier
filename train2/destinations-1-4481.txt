I knew something was up when I landed in the airport and the line for Starbucks was 5 people deep, and the line for Popeye's fried catfish was about an hour long. Well I still had it in me to venture into the city...and it was straight up Ghetto. You could tell that at one time it was probably gorgeous but it had been run into the ground. I'm also not one for the humidity, it's a very stuffy city.
