This is a great biography on Gia. I must have read it a thousand times. The way he talks about Gia's life as something we can all unfortunately learn from is wonderful. If you want to prove drugs effect everyone, just look at Gia. She had it all and lost it just as quickly from herion. Anyways, I would reccomend this book to anyone who has ever seen the movie, or been interested in Gia. It tells her story in a complete, honest manner!
