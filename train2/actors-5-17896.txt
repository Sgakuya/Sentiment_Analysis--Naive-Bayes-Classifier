Kathy Brier is definitely the best actress to hit daytime in a long time! Her scenes as she was being made to oink as part of the hazing were so moving that she had me in tears. Then when she sang America the Beautiful and had the one lone tear streaming down her face, it spoke volumes. Plus, not only can she act, she can sing! What a voice that girl has! I only watch One Life to Live right now because of her, and of course the romance between her character Marcie and Nathaniel Marston's character of Al. What a cute couple they are!
