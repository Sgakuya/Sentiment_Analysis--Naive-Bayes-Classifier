Don't be fooled, sleazy car dealer will give you a better deal. I pay $140 a month for no service. When I complained, they say I can cancel but it will cost me $600 dollars. The ethics of the sales staff are the lowest. When I complained from day one about no service, they told me of a scheme to get an up graded phone from the insurance company. I regret ever doing it. I feel bad that I stooped to their level. The phones that we received were LG3200 phones. In my opinion, the only thing they are good for is throwing them away. I'll give you some good advice, if you start to go into one of their stores, turn around and run far, far away. Alltel bought them out. I thought it would get better then. But Alltel still refers me to these idiots. Phone-less in Nebraska
