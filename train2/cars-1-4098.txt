Was hot on it for a while. But after I talked to a Mazda dealer and checked a demo in showroom, I just walked away, as fast I can. A brand new demo is so rusty under its body and ports. I don't know what cheap materials used by Ford(Yes, it's a Ford!). I got a Highlander instead. By having seen so many recalls for Tribute, I just feel myself lucky enough.
