There is none better when a Shakespearean role on Stage or Screen comes along. 5.0 is where it will stay just because of that alone. Even though he did not make many comedic roles that I can remember. Oh! there is one with Marilyn Monroe called The Prince and The Showgirl. But mostly his was mostly dramatic. Most notable are Wuthering Heights, Pride And Prejudice(loved it), Spartacus as is evil opponent Crassus, Khartoum as the Great Mahdi. Can never forget when he looked up at that pole...the look in his face!! One more memorable role was.....Is It Safe!!! Is It Safe!!! Is It Safe!!!!....repeated I think as I remembered counting one time said 13 times!! Count it next time. That to me will stay with me everytime I visit a Dentist's chair, Dustin Hoffman's fear in Marathon Man. Loooooook...away.........!!! ......................
