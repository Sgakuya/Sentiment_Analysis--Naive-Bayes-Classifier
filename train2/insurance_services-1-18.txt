Their insurance does not pay when one of their insured is a fault. I know for a fact because one of their insured hit my car their lame ass excuse was their client was not a fault and refused to pay for damages to my car. You tell me who was in the wrong I was making a left turn off a two lane side street into a privet driveway my left turn signal was on geico's client passed me on left side hitting my car.
