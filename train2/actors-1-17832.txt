I KNOW THIS IS JUST ACTING, BUT I THINK EILEEN DAVIDSON'S CHARACTER AS ASHLEY] HAS CHANGED FOR SURE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHES. SHE SEEMS TO BE A VERY VERY VERY UNHAPPY CAMPER. I AM READY TO QUIT WATCHING THE Y&R.SHE SEEMS SO MISERABLE WITH HERSELF AND OTHERS. SHE HID THE SECRET FROM TELLING VICTOR, AND HER 6 YR.OLD HAD TO FIND OUT THE HARD WAY.SHE SHOULD BE SENT TO PRISON FOR TAKING VICTOR'S SPERM, WITHOUT HIS CONSENT.HE SHOULD NOT HAVE FORGIVEN HER. SHE HAS BRAD. VICTOR IS MARRIED TO NICKI. I WISH ASHLEY WOULD GO SOMEWHERE. IS HER CONTRACT UP YET?????
