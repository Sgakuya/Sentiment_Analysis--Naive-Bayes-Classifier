Sheep, sheep, and more sheep. Two large islands on the other side of the planet from America. Can't even see the Big Dipper down there. Their nearest neighbors are Australia and Antarctica. Pretty damn isolated, I'd say. Kiwi makes me go wee-wee. But it's a good fruit. Ugly bird. Maori? What the heck kind of language is THAT?!? It ain't American English, that's for sure.
