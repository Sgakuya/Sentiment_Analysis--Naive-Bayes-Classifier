She has to be one of my personal favorites. I like her work and she is a very pretty girl. However, she is not overrated I feel becuase she isn't plastered all over the TV screens or magazines, like someone such as Britney. I'm not saying that's bad but I just dont see how she is overrated....but thats just one person's opinion.
