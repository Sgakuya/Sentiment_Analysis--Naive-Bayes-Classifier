Hilary has 2 platinum selling albums because her pre-teen fans who don't know what real talent is will buy out CDs of her monotone voice. Bad actress, even worse singer. Her acting is very jerky and she always seems to be hyperventilating when delivering lines. For her singing voice...she has NO range. Seriously, if she didn't have so many tone deaf fans she wouldn't be selling albums. I will eat a shoe the day she wins a Grammy.
