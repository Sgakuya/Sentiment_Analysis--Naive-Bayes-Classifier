Tom Hanks is an awesome actor! All the movies he's ever made are nothing but excellent. My favorites include Appollo 13, Saving Private Ryan, You Got Mail, Castaway and especially Forrest Gump ... his performance in Forrest Gump is AMAZING! He brought chills to my spine. He is one of the few actors if not the only actor that could pull off such a challenging role. Overall, a very talented actor.
