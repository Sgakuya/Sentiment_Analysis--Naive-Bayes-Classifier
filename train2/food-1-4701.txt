Oh my God, the horror the inhumanity of limburger cheese. My father is a limburger fan and my mother, for some reason I have never figured out, used to make him limburger sandwiches..sometimes she would heat it up in the microwave, tainting the air (and anything heated up in the microwave) for weeks. I really don't understand limburger cheese. A big part of the whole eating process is smell..how the heck can you enjoy something that stinks like a combination of cow manure and rotting onions? strange..limburger cheese is strange and unnecessary
