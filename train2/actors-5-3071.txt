Hmm...one word: BRILLIANT Dustin Hoffman was my all time No.1 Actor, but Russ over the last few years has turned my head around. Just loved him in Romper Stomper and then he just tipped the scales in A Beautiful Mind. Such an outstanding performance! He needs more challenging roles however. I didnt like Gladiator and I wasnt a big rap in Proof of Life. Such stuff as Romper and Mind are what Russ needs. Something to get his teeth stuck into. I often dream of meeting Mr Crowe...and I guess I can only dream on! Gorgeous.
