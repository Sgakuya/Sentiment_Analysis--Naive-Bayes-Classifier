Oh my goodness! I should have read the other ratings before posting mine (even though I'm including it anyway). I really thought that it was just *me* that had an absolute *loathing for that commercial. I wonder if they realize that consumers can be very much like roaches...if you see just *one* person complaining about something, there are hundreds that you will never see. Let's hope that they realize that fact and stop the torture.... Oh *please* make it stop!!!!! Those commercials for the light food line are so *majorly* annoying ( don't-a pay-a lot-a for-a top-a quality-a I hated the Macarena when it was actually the Macarena and I hate this even more) that I can't even *think* about the name Michelina much less eat it. I thought it was impossible for *any* commercial to be more annoying than those dreadful Rally's commercials (the boy who is suing McDonalds should sue Rally's instead...McDonalds merely offers food with some lower cost options and an occasional healthy food, but Rally's says your gotta eat, eat, eat, eat, eat while offering *no* food that is not full of saturated fats). But that's neither here nor there...suffice it to say that I was wrong when I thought that no other commercial could be as annoying. It may sound stupid, but while I *know* that some companies have delibrately annoying commercials just to increase name recognition...and potentially boost sales, if I find a commercial so bad that I can't foget it there's no way I'll buy the product regardles of the quality.
