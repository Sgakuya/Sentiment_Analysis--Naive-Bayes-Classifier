This novel is one of my favorites. It takes you on a trip to different cities and towns of foreign countries. Hemingway loves to write of human reactions and he explains human personalities very well. His style of writing is quick and very easy to read, though underneath the subtlety of his writing is a deep message in which the reader must figure out. His colorful words portray beautiful images of Europe. He is one of my favorite authors!
