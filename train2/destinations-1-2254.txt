The people there are not bad. The poverty is beyond belief, the Taliban treats women and minority groups in brutal fashion and the terrain is rugged and inhospitable. A democratic government needs to be established there and have this totalitarian regime come to a close. I feel so sorry for all the people living in Afghanistan now because the group that represents their country has a horrible reputation throughout the world and you know what? The people are going to be the ones paying for the ruthless tactics of the Taliban.
