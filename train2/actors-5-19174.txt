Matthew Perry is sooo great! No matter what ANY of you say I am his biggest fan!! When I see the show Friends I just feel great because he is such an amazing actor. I tape the show Friends every night and I have watched every one of his movies 7-10 times... I watched the whole 9 yards 11 times!!! I was soo dissapointed when he went into rehab for the second time but I knew he would fight his way out. I was especially crushed when I heard that he was in the middle of making a movie called SERVICING SARA. Now that he got out I lve him even more though and if I met him it would be a dream come true
