I hate Adelphia. I would change services but there is no other option for cable/broadband/dsl in my area; Not even satellite (there is no line of site to any satellite service from my house). My biggest complaints are: 1. Price. I'm not sure how it is ethical to charge people $90/month for BASIC cable and broadband. This is absolutely absurd. 2. Customoer service. Sucks. 3. Accounting. They routinely screw up my bill. No wonder they are bankrupt. 4. Price. I can't say enough about this. good god. Someone please start another cable company in my area!!!!
