 1984 is more than a book, as you know if you've seen the natorious Big Brother posters everywhere. It's a social documentary. After reading this book, the world becomes a more true place, where lies can be seen, and it is understood that Orwell is more of a Notradomis than a fiction writer. I recommend this book to everyone and anyone, it'll change the way you view our society and the world forever.
