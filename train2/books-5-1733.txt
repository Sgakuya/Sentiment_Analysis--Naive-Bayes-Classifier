You're kidding, right? Giving Kevin Kell a five star rating is as easy as falling out of my chair. Everything about the strip... the storyline, the humor, the art, the customization , are all top notch. There MIGHT be one or two comics I'd prefer more, but I sure can't think of them right now. Great work, Bill Holbrook!
