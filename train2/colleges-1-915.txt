I found that CTU was not for me and when I tried to complete my first 2 classes and then drop, they told me that even if I drop after my classes, I will still have to pay for my next 2 classes. My Admissions officer told me that I had until the first day of any class to drop without being charged for that class. Can we say fraud? I have had to open a complaint with the FTC and BBB to get this resolved. Just a bit more information that I found out on CTU... "Private college on probation for sales tactics" Looks like AIU online, owned by Career Education Corp (the same company that owns CTU) may be loosing their accreditation. How far is CTU behind??? http://www.oregonlive.com/business/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/business/1133934924264580.xml&coll=7
