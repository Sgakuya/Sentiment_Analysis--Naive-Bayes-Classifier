Tamara took a very popular role and made it her own. Her character makes me so mad at her sometimes, but she makes me feel, even though right this minute I think Carly's having brain issues being with Sonny instead of Lorenzo, I know Tamara brings the best with what she gets. Can't wait to see her on her own and becoming the strong woman that she is.
