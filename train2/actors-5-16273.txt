Love Maurice Benard! He's intense, hot, sexy and real. He make GH one of the reasons I continue to watch it. He's suffered through some lousy writing and character development over the past year but has turned in some great performances. I've enjoyed his work best with Vanesa Marcil and Nancy Lee Grahn. He definitely deserved the daytime emmy last year.
