I know people love this city... I went entirely on recommendations from friends, but I had a rotten-arse-horrible time here. First of all, it was colder than cold. Incredibly cold. Face-freezing-off cold. So there was that against it... but what really burned me about this city was that the people I encountered (and I understand that this is not representative of all Hungarians) were jerks. I was harassed by transit police, pushed around by people recruiting for hostels, accosted by Hungarian prostitutes, and nearly mugged by people on the street. I can't say anything good about MY experience in Budapest, and believe me when I say that I really wanted to like this city. Plus, the train ride was really long arriving from Austria and going away to Prague with very little to look at.
