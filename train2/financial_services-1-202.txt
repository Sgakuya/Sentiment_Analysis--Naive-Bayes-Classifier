Bank America is the pits. I had a safe deposit box there for years. When I went to close it I had misplaced a key. I paid the $20 but asked that if I found the key could I get a reimbursement. No problem. Well 4 business days later I find the key but am told too bad. No reimbursement. That was the final straw with this bank. I had already had numerous issue with them before. Don't do business with them.
