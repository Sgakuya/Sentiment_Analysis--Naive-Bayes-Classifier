Their bagpipes annoy the hell out of me, what with all that screeching and wailing. It sounds like a cat fight when those damn things play. Their accent isn't even understandable, much less pronounceable! Tartans?!? Now what the heck are they for, anyway, besides, lighting up a room at night? Kilts on guys? Don't think so. Guys wear pants, anyway. Haggis turns my stomach, pun intended. Whiskey's OK, but the REAL man's drink is good old-fashioned AMERICAN BEER! None of that fancy imported stuff! Rocky soil. Dreary weather. Sourpusses from Midlothian to the Orkneys. Hey, did you hear about the Scotsman who bought a set of encyclopedia Brittanicas----PAPERBACK? AMERICA, BAY-BEE!!!!!
