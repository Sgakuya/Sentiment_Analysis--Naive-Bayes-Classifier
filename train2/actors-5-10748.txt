What a wonderful actress! She is simply phenominal. I've never watched a movie that Annette Bening starred in and been disappointed. She gave wonderful performances in The American President and Richard III . I thought that she had such chemistry with Gary Shandling in the hilarious comedy, What Planet Are You From? . She was also great in The Siege . Her best performance was probably in American Beauty - talk about presence! Simply phenominal acting on her part. Annette Bening is one hell of an actress who is just producing more and more good films as time goes by.
