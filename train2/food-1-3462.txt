I generally can't stand frozen pizza-pizza is my fave food and you just can't equal a pizzeria and it's so easy to just pick one up but I do keep the frozen one around for the rainy day and of all the frozen one's I have ever had Tombstone and Essensia are the only ones that were alright and the only one's that I will ever get. I used to like Totino's but I guess my tastes changed or the product did somewhere along the years. Totino's does have a unique crust-a kind of wavy crust that isn't too thin or too thick and unique in that the cheese has at least some cheddar in it and that gives it a different taste. The sauce is too thick and too sweet tho. Oh yeah-it's also really cheap and actually considering how cheap it is makes it a little better.
