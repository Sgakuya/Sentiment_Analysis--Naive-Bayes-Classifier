Can't praise it highly enough. Pibgorn's characters and plots (and those of McEldowney's other strip, 9 Chickweed Lane) are intelligent, witty, sexy, ferocious, wry, innocent, complicated, literate, sarcastic, humane, knowing, elegant and sophisticated. A comic strip for grown-ups and other civilised people, in other words. No wonder no American newspaper dares touch it.
