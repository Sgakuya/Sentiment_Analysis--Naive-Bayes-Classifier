I'm sure there are many kids around the world who like Winnie the Pooh. That's because the tales of Winnie the Pooh are really great. It is great because the tales and the story are easy to follow and fun. It's all about playing and living together with friends. The Tales of Winnie the Pooh teaches children a lot about the morality of friendship. Also, the pictures, the image of each character are very cute. I like Winnie the Pooh even now, and I'm in college. It's a good book and a good influence on kids.
