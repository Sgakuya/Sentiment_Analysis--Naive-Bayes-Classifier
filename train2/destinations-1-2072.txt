The country that probably first developed bread is commemorated every year during the Jewish holiday of Passover by eating unleavened bread(matzoh) which helps promote constipation. This is a constructive way to think of this country which enslaved the Jews and hasn't improved since. During the past year,Egyptian television has featured a true family entertainment series on The Protocals of the Elders of Zion, considered an antisemitic forgery since the worst Pharoahs were in business(That's why the best movie depicting Egypt is The Mummy with Boris Karloff). The country that landed a lucky sucker punch against Israel in the '73 Yom Kippur war are also the homelands of Yasser (The Palestinean)Arafat and at least one pilot who deliberately flew a plane full of passengers into the ocean...so far.
