In my very humble opinion, Ms. Flannery is the best actress on TV. If she leaves Bold and Beautiful, I probably would not watch it. She has been on so many programs and done many movies before going to B&B. A beautiful lady with amazing talents. She has been through much illness from cancer, yet she goes on and does her acting and directing better than ever.
