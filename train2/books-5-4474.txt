This is possibly the most romantic book I have ever read. Robert Jordan sacrificing his life to be a part of the guerilla army fighting for Spanish independence. The improbable and innocent love between him and Maria. The tragic ending was so quick and surprising, even though it had been building up to that point from the beginning.
