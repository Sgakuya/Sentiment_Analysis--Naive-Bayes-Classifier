You are a traitor to your own Country! Maybe you will change now that it is hurting your pocketbook..Was so glad they cancelled your speaking spot at the charity in Florida! Good for the United Way. I did not know that speaking on behalf of a charity cost that charity $20,000.00. I guess that is $20,000.00 you won't be spending on behalf of Iraq. Shame! Shame! Shame!
