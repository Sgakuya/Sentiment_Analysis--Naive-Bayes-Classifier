I have one of his earlier films on video called Heavens Burning. he is very talented, very convincing, and very great too. In Heavens Burning he steals the scene from the other actors and actresses that he has been with and against in the movie. Russell, may you have many years in success in doing what you do best, whether it is music, acting, or whatever.
