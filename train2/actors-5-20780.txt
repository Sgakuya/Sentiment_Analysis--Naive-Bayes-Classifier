I'm in love with Sarah Jessica both as a person and an actress! I love Sex in the City it was very well written. Sarah Jessica added to her role tremendously through her true artistic expression of the character who she so closely related to that it seemed impossible to view Sarah Jessica outside the realms of Carrie and her friends in NYC. I also love her real life personification of her Jewish roots. Way to go! I throughly enjoyed watching her HBO hit series and can't wait to see what endeavor she follows next.
