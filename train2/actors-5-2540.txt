Hoffman can take you from the tedium of suburbia to the old west to a mental hospital and you believe and care about every person he becomes along the way. He is an exceptionally gifted actor. His one and only major flop was Ishtar and somehow, I find it easier to blame Beatty for that. But then, I admit to being extremely prejudiced in this case.
