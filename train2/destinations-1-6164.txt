Michigan is a poor way to waste valueable years of your life. The people are mostly self-centered with bad attitudes. A construction cone is something that's very common to the people of Southeast Michigan as every major interstate is always being torn up. People wear miserable looks on their face as they trudge through the snow and sleet to get to their jobs that they hate. The attitude factors into the personalities as it's very hard to find anyone that has one. It's very difficult to get laid here as the females are all into exclusive relationships that revolve around money. I come from Las Vegas and am a Blackjack dealer who has worked here in Detroit for 2 years and am working on getting a transfer back to Nevada or someplace where the people are somewhat normal. I'm 27 years old and I have slept with 42 girls, and I have only been laid once in almost 2 years here in Southeastern Michigan. The hard-nosed attitudes get old, and they make you feel like you are aging twice as fast as you really are. Not to mention you lose 6 months a year of leisure time with horrible weather. I think the sun shines here about 2 days from December to February. These factors make Michigan unpleasant and unbearable to visit, let alone live in. The males only live to about 65 here and then they die of stress related causes. The wives slave-drive the husbands until they die. Also, the job demands here are very uptight and people take things way too serious. If they don't drive you into depression here, they will drive you into a heart-attack, so make sure you have good health coverage.
