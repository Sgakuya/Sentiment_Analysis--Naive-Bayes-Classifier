The best thing about this guy is he just always makes me laugh. It doesn't matter if the statement's normal or stupid. Hugh Grant can somehow make it funny. I think this is what women find so sexy about him. Never underestimate the power of a sense of humor in a man. It can get him tremendously far. Yes, he's fantastic in romantic comedies but he also proven that he can be a cad too. I think he's wonderful in all his attempts.
