I'm ashamed to say that in the last 10 years, I've written more books than I read. But while languishing in an airport, I took the plunge and got Da Vinci Code. It was an outstanding book -- a thinking person's mystery. It delved into subjects I was clueless about: Catholicism, Art History, and something called the Sacred Feminine. I think the general premise of the book (which I won't give away) may outrage some devout Catholics. Some aspects of the book were a bit clunky, particularly the code-breaking escapades which -- in some cases -- played out like something you would see in the back pages of Games Magazine. I cracked a few of them without a sweat. But overall, Da Vinci Code has enough plot twists and intrigue to make it a very worthwhile read.
