I generally shy away from Oprah's book of the month selections - simply because I hate the notion that Oprah and her house wife disciples can make a book an instant success...however, Wally Lamb's I Know This Much Is True was a great read. Hard to put down. Heartbreaking, breathtaking, thought-provoking. Definetly check it out.
