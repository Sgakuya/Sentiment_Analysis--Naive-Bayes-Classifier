For anyone who has worked in the office or staff environment, Dilbert is so right on target that if it were an arrow, it would split another arrow that is planted in the exact center of a bullseye. Incredibly hilarious (one of the few comic strips these days that is). My favorite character is the Pointy-Haired Boss. People like him really do exist and are really that incompetent. In a life imitates art irony, there was a Dilbert strip where the CEO wanted to give Dilbert a raise; but his boss thwarted it by insisting that he didn't have a worker named Dilbert (in my instance, I got a lower than expected review because my boss did not understand how the review rating system operated, thus I lost a promotion). Wally cracks me up too; he defies logic by staying employed without ever actually done little more than hold a coffee cup and having long meetings with himself and a newspaper in the company bathroom. I also like Alice. In Wayne's World, Wayne and Garth expressed their fondness of Betty Rubble. Well, I have the same feelings for Alice, who is very intelligent, kind of cute (what can you say about a girl with pyramid-shaped hair), and a lass who can definitely handle herself (MUST CONTROL FIST O' DEATH!!!!). The TV version of Dilbert did a great disservice to this outstanding comic strip. In my hometown newspaper, it appears in the Business Section. Dilbert rules.
