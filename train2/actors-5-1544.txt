One of my favorite actors; every role that I've seen him in was just perfect. I loved him in Seven and Shawshank Redemption especially. I'm a little skeptical about the new Bruce Almighty movie (Jim Carrey flick), but at least they casted a great actor to play God's role. Even if this movie bombs, he's still one of the better actors out there.
