Poor Gwyneth!!!...I don't see how anyone could HATE her! She has so much class and elegance...and her acting is 100% believable! I have never doubted any role that she has ever played, and although I may not have liked all of her movies, I think she is definetly worthy of an oscar!...(however, I would have prefered to see Cate Blanchett win as well!)
