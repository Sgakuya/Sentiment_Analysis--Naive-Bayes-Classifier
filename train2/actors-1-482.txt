I would actually give him 2* for being involuntarily funny and for the fact that he does have some kind of personality. However,his legacy is so incredibly negative.He should simply say sorry for every Indian he has killed in his Westerns,how phony, racially portrayed and unrealistic that was.As for the patriotic crap a la Green Berets-everyone is entitled to his opinion, but when you depict such a controversial subject in such a manner it is simply horrifying. At least Rambo was funny. American icon? Tell that to the millions that died in Vietnam.
