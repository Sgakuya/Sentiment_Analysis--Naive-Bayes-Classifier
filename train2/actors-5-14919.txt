The most amazing child actress has got to be Shirley Temple. What can she not do? Ever since I was little I was so fascinated by her talent. She was funny, adorable, and just plain entertaining. She could match any adult that acted alongside her. I have the utmost respect for child actors becuase it's so difficult. I'm very proud of Shirley though for going on to do even greater things in her life. Thanks for the laughs!!
