Laurence Fishburne definately possesses a certain talent that is missing in many of today's celebrities that call themselves actors . He is extremely talented, and seems to put a lot of time and effort into each role that he takes on. His best performance by far, in my opinion, was as Ike Turner in What's Love Got to Do With It? . His acting was so great that he made his character so unlikeable (and rightfully so). Let's not forget his brilliant performances in Othello and Higher Learning . Boyz N' The Good , Event Horizon and The Matrix were all great performances from one hell of an actor.
