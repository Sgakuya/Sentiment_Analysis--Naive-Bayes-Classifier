Garden State? I still havent seen ONE garden yet, therefore I dont see how the whole state is referred to as the Garden State? People from New Jersey are usually annoying, and have to stop being New Yorker wannabes. The Turnpike is the worst piece of roadway ever constructed. People there arent allowed to pump their own gas. This is because they need gas station attendants to create more lowpaying jobs for their uneducated and untrainable workers. And if you ever see a person from New Jersey at a gas station in another state, they look absolutely helpless. Overall...just a bad place to be.
