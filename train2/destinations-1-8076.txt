I'm sorry but I think the museum sucks. Once there was this frame (don't know if it's still there) that had a big blob of blank ink in the middle. I was like What the hell is that? Even I could make a blob of ink, frame it, and put it on the wall. And they don't let you carry a camera...I can't believe people would actually take pictures in there.
