Hepburn, Davis, Fonda, Streep, Lange, Field and Spacek. Add to the list Glenn Close (finally rewarded a Golden Globe this year) I believe Ms Close will surely win an Oscar someday not as a 'lifetime achievement' thing but for a great part. She came close in 5 other nominated performances. She was very unfortunate to not win for Dangerous Liasons. Nobody does 'demented' as good as Close and her final scenes back to back 1/ The public snubbing at the Opera and that stumble 2/ The crack-up in front of the help and 3/ taking her pancake make-up off is one of the great moments in screen history.....She was the best of a bad bunch in 'Stepford Wives', beleivable beyond comprehension in 'Fatal Attraction', beautifully underplayed in 'Reversal of Fortune' and 80's chic in 'Jagged Edge'. I could go on but where is the justice in this world when someone like Hilary Swank can land 2 oscars already while the likes of Sigourney Weaver Annette Bening and the brilliant Ms Close go without....Shame on you Oscar, Shame She's won SAGs Emmy's, Tony's and Golden Globes etc etc and an Oscar win would surely be looming in the near future.....
