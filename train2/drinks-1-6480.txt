Oh, yeah! I agree with Shroomwoman and the others - Tab was/is NASTY stuff. I remember it only semi-fondly because it came along at a time when my grandmother had just found out she was diabetic and it seemed thrilling to her to be able to enjoy soft drinks again. She always had them around the house back when. If she were alive today though, I'm sure she would be much happier with the gigantic selection of sugar-free sodas and other products available. I doubt even she would touch that awful stuff any more.
