I love Angelina Jolie. I've only seen a few of her movies but her portrayal as Lisa in Girl, Interrupted won me over. Since I have similar problems to her I could really relate. ALso I've heard that Angelina cuts herslef or at least used to and I think that means she's had a really troubled past - like me. She has this whole dark side to her personality that is very endearing. I think she's hot.
