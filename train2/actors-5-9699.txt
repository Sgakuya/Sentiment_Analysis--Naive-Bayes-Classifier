Cate Blanchett is an amazing actress. I would pay to see any movie she does. She's possibly the only actress I can say that about. I don't even feel a need to name specific movies to recomend of hers. Every one of her movies is worth checking out. But Elizabeth and Oscar and Lucinda are without a doubt her best.
