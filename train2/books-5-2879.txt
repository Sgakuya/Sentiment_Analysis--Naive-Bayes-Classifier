A fascinating account of Lewis and Clark's Voyage of Discovery into the newly-acquired Louisiana Purchase (and on to the Pacific Ocean). The focus is on Meriwether Lewis, but the entire trip is covered in just the right level of detail - enough so that you can imagine what it must have been like to make such an historic journey, but not so much that you get bogged down in trivial incidents. Ambrose, the author, describes the trip with the enthusiasm of a little kid, and his attitude is contagious.
