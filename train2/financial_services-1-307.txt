I have been a customer with Wachoiva since 1993 (my senior year in college). My employer (I am currently interviewing so I can get away from them as well) did not pay me for my full paycheck on Jan. 7, 2005. So my balance was $640. I had already written my rent check so I had called the bank and my landlord. I was told the check should not clear. Well, they went ahead and paid the check anyway which was $998 and charged me a $30 overdraft fee. They then preceded to pay or not pay checks at will charging each one a $30 insufficient funds or overdraft fee. My account is now -$1166+. Now they are threatening to close the account and report to Credit Reporting Agencies and possibly affect me opening accounts elsewhere (I already have opened an accout with another bank and a credit union). All I have been told when I call about this is that their check paying policy is discretionary and they can't refund any of the $30 fees which total over $300. So now I am waiting on my state tax refund which is going to clear up the Wachovia account instead of going into my savings. I will never bank with Wachoiva again.
