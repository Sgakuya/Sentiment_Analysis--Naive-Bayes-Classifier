One of my first 16 Magazine/Tiger Beat-type crushes; I developed a big thing for Billy Mumy at about the age of 11 or 12 devoting several pages of a scrap book and the interior of a silver locket to him. As time went by, I couldn't help noticing how he was always popping up in old films and television shows and I soon realized he had had a pretty impressive career as a child actor before he landed what would be his best-known role as Will Robinson on Lost in Space. Unlike a lot of kids in the biz, acting seems to have been a positive experience for Bill Mumy. He has gone on to enjoy an eclectic career that has included acting, music, writing, voice-over work and the creation of action comic books.
