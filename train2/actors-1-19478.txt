It should be Everybody Hates Raymond, really. Everybody does. Him, and that stupid Ray Romano. He's a mediocre actor, but his show is so bad that it should have been cancelled ages ago. His voice is nasal and he's whiny, and just unfanny. Whenever I'm flipping channels and come across Everybody Loves Raymond I get a strong urge to throw up. He's so bad that even Adam Sandler is funnier than him, and that says a lot.
