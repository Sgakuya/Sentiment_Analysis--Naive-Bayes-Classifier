Oh mercy! What can I say? I will admit that the face caught my eye first and then I saw one of his films...and the man is brilliant! There is no one, and I mean NO ONE that compares to him. He can play such a wide range of characters with such ease. He's so fun to watch! I find myself watching his films over and over and catching something new each time. I love to hear his voice...that accent! Whew! I could melt! He has a way of looking at his female leads that just makes you want to get naked with him! I love the subtle facial expressions he uses and those eyes...they're the sexiest on Earth. In Maid In Manhattan when he tells JLo she should have worn a different dress made my heart almost jump out of my skin. Did you notice the little movement he made with his mouth then? Oh God! Okay, I know I'm gushing, but he's the most beautiful man in the world! My husband has been warned. If Ralph ever shows up, I'm out the door (without even packing a suitcase).
