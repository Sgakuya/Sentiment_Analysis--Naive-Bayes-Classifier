I have a 1999 Dodge Ram 2500 with the Cummins engine. Great engine - horrible transmission!! When will Dodge get a clue and design a reliable trans? Overdrive solenoid and governer replaced at 24K. Complete replacement at 46k. Truck has been used to tow at the most 1400 pounds! Look at any Dodge forum and what topic is ALWAYS discussed - tranmission problems!! I'm selling this truck to buy a Toyota! At least they have a sense of quality!!!
