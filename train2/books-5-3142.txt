This particular book gave me some new insight on the topic of vampires as a whole. The one thing that made this book so interesting is how through the transformation from being a human being to becoming a creature of the night you begin to see the world entirely differently. I believe that the vampire explained it to the reporter who was doing the interview as indescribable. Humans don't posses the level of comprehension that it would take to conceive of dealing with something as complex as how a vampire sees the world.
