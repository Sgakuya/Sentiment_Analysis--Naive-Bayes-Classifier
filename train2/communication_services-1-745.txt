Hey people! Half of the reviews on this site are fake. Look at the ones that are 5 stars-- they read like advertisements. Look at this opening sentence from Caldude below: With ground breaking technology Sprint PCS has risen to become one of the best cellular providers on the market. What kind of a real person writes a comment like that? It looks like it was taken right from Sprint Advertising copy. If omitted all of the fake reviews that Rate It All allows, Sprint's score would be more like 2 stars. And as a customer, I can tell you that's probably a lot more accurate. Another funny thing is that I looked, but there's no place to rate Rate It All on this site. I wanted to say that it's BS that they allow Sprint to post bogus comments, but there's no place to do it. Oh well, you get what you pay for
