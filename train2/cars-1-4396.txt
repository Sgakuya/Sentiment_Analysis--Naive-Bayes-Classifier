I have a 95 and a 97 windstar. Head gasket on 95 was replaced free. Now the head gasket on my 97 has blown at 70,000 miles. Ford does not cover this, as they claim the problem has been fixed, but look around on the internet and there are thousand who have the same problem with the newer vehicles. It is going to cost $2200 to put right. I would recommend you get some time of extended warranty that will cover the head gasket. I think it's time to go back to trusty Honda.
