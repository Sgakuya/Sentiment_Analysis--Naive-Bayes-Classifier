Has built a big rep partly by avoiding the kinds of roles most young actresses are thrust into. But she couldn't do that if she didn't have the talent, which she has tons of. The beauty cannot help but be a big plus; it's that kind of business. But what beauty. Gotta say it; this chick has natural beauty like no other young actress around. No one has yet mentioned great work (in a kind of unsympathetic second-banana role) in Ghost World. Should be just at the very beginning of a huge career.
