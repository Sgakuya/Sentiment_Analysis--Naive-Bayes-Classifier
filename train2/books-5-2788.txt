This is one of the most compelling series of books I have ever read. You get a COMPLETE view of WW2 through the eyes of the leader of free Europe and the greatest Prime Minister the UK ever had. What a great man. These books are brilliant. There are hundreds of books telling the story of the war through American eyes; read it through the eyes of the English, and be amazed.
