I don' think I have read anything by Hemingway that I could honestly rate below five stars, except the Garden of Eden which would recieve four. I think that if any author can explain the alcohol the characters are drinking more than the war going on around them and still keep you interested they are doing a pretty good job. The relationship between the main characters is heartbreaking and real, certainly no fairy tale.
