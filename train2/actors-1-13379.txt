Demi uses people to enhance her career. Ever seen her E! True Hollywood Story? She married that first guy because he was an up and coming musician and then divorced him because he wasn't so up and coming in the end. And I won't even have to mention her relationship with Hollywood's it-boy Ashton Kutcher. She uses others and the press in a negative way. She overexposes herself when she is promoting movies (why do you think Charlie's Angels 2 didn't do as well as expected? Even Drew Barrymore admitted it was because of Demi) and she doesn't even seem to be a good mother, as I recently read in US Weekly that she sleeps over Ashton's house with her kids. That is just creepy. Oh, and she lies. As if I'm going to believe that this forty-something year old doesn't exercise, eats whatever she wants, and still looks like that. (she recently said this stuff in an Entertainment Tonight interview). Her movie failures come about because she is annoying and can't play the press in a positive way. I'm sick of her and she's only been back in the news for a couple months!
