I read this book last year in English class, and just found it to be a very deep and depressing novel which explores a young man's horror during the Holocaust. It almost brought me to tears when Elie's father died. And of course, it is short, so I was able to read it in about two hours without putting it down once, and when I was finish, I stopped for a moment to remind myself that the Holocaust really DID occur and that evil in this world is a cruel reality.
