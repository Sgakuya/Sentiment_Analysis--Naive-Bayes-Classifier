This is one of the most complicated novels ever written. Joyce's imagery and the lyrical quality of his language are amazing. However, this book requires a close reading. It has several metaphors, motifs and themes that ran simultaneously throughout the novel. I only recommend reading this book if you have patience and several months. If you do, it is worth it.
