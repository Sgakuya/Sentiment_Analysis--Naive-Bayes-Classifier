I had this when I was visiting my parents, my grandfather had left some over. There was no beer and I was desperate so I decided to try the dreaded Natural Light. To my suprise it was not aboslutely terrible, it tasted like sour water. It's almost tastless after you have a couple, but I would imagine getting wasted off this stuff would bring a massive hangover. If you want cheap beer atleast go with Keystone.
