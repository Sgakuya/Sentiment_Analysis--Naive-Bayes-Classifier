From Time Magazine...The tribal courts sentence 18-year-old Makhutar Mai to be gang raped. Because her 14-year-old brother had a girlfriend from the higher class. Her father was held at gun point and could not help her. After Makhutar was raped, she was forced to walk home naked. Hearing these stories make me sick.
