I think she is an amazing actor. I first saw her back in 1994 in the movie, Kids. I had seen her before as a model/actress in Seventeen magazine. Then I didn't see her for a while. She then was in Studio 54. The next movie that I saw her in was Boys on the Side. I thought that not only was the movie incredible but so was Chloe. I now seek out movies that she is in, because I think so highly of her as an actress. I also really respect the fact that she does so many independent films and hasn't sold out in to Hollywood yet.
