Being from Kansas City, I feel terribly disloyal rating Russell Stover chocolates only one star. However, there's no getting around the fact that they are simply unpalatable. The chocolate is greasy and tasteless, and the fillings are either sickly sweet, chalky, or hard as a rock. I nearly broke a tooth on the Butterfinger-type candy, and then it stuck in my molars like cement. It's safe to say that Russell Stover produces the worst boxed chocolates I've ever tasted.
