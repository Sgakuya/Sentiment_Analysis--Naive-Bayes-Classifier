The food was great, Beautiful buildings, amazing street performers. But it was a little too corprate. I hear that the street performers have to audition every year and only the same people get in year after year. No matter how predictable and unoriginal they are. While at the same time not allowing newer original acts perform. In not allowing them to perform they are actually killing the street arts. Who wants to see another guy on a tall unicycle anyway? But I do love it there.
