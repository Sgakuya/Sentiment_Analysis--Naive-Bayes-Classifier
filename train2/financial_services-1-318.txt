I have had my capital one card now for 5 years. I have never been late and have excellent credit. Capital one sent out a blank check offer for me to use and I used it. Needless to say that was the wrong thing to do. From the beginning they said that I would have a certain amount of credit PLUs the blank check to use.......so I started using the card and now it is over drawn 1800$. I called in and takled to 2 different people to ake sure that my credit limit was that amount and they assured me that the information they were giving me was correct. I asked to speak to a supervisor about my issues and they refused to let me talk to anyone. After a wek I finally tlaked to 2 diferent people and they were still of no help. So I asked them to take a look at the rcorda dn recorded phone coversations and they told me they do not keep records of anything. So my suggestion to anyone is DO NOT USE CAPITAL ONE ...and if you do RECORD ALL PHONE COVERSATIONS AND TAKE NOTES. KEPP ANY EVIDENCE BECAUSE THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY ADN RUIN YOUR CREDIT
