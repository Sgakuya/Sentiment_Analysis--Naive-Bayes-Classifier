I never had anything against Elizabeth Hurley. I thought of her as a beautiful, intelligent woman. Until I heard her quoted to say that she'd rather die than be as fat as Marilyn Monroe. That level of narrow-mindedness, arrogance, and blatant bitchiness made me instantly hate her. I never say this about women, but she should have kept her pretty mouth shut.
