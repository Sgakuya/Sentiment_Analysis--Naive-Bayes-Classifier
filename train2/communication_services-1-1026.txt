The Cell One rep in Ohio told me that my Nationwide Plan would work in all of Ohio, PA, WV. When I asked if I'd get charged while at college... she told me that no matter where I was in Ohio (even if it said Extended AREA) I wouldn't be charged any extra. I thought it sounded too good to be true.. but she insisted it was their new plan. BS! I got my phone bill the other day.... $350!! When asked why I had been changed for all my calls (I didn't even go over my minutes)... they told me that the certain city (in OH) was not on the plan and all my free nights and weekends were VOID when in that city. To say the least... Cellular One is a terrible service. NO ONE GO THERE!!!!
