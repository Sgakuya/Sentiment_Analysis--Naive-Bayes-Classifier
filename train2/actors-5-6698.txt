Sean Hayes is one of the greatest actors on prime television at the moment. His character Jack McFarland is out of this world hilarious. Sure the show has way too many gay stereotypes, but they also counteract them alot to make both come out equal. I would be really surprised if Megan Mullaly and Sean Hayes aren't offered their own show once W&G gets cancelled...the best tv comedians to come out in ages...
