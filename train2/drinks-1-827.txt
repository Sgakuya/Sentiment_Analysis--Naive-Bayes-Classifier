ALWAYS skunked, and ALWAYS overpriced. If a date of mine orders this overhyped, foul tasting beer, it's an immediate two strikes against her. Not that I'm superficial or anything... Anyway, Europeans should not be brewing light beers to begin with - it just doesn't make any sense. And if you taste this sorry ass beer you will understand why.
