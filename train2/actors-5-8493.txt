A classic actress that played such a wide range of roles and types. As great as she was, because she was such a chameleon in the way she approached and was absorbed into her characters, I feel she was underrated. I think that time and history will be kind to her and she will be remembered as a great Actress. She will forever be Mrs. Robinson.
