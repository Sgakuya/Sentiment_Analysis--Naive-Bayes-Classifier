The old model was a tahoe with Cadillac badges on it and barcolounger seats inside. I thought I was in some kind of trailer park family room. All I needed was a big screen tv and a brewski in the armrest. The styling is garish and cheap looking. Save the money that the Cadillac badges cost you and buy a tahoe or GMC.
