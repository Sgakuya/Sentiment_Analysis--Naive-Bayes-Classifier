I purchased the system and the adiovox boom box... Well with 2 different boom boxes both were defective (their technical support staff were very rude, so I will also never buy any adiovox products) and when I had had enough of poor product quality, I had to argue with the Sirius customer service for just over 26 minutes to avoid a $75 canncelation fee. At one point I heard one of the customer service staff in the back ground make a sarcastic please hold before the person I talked to put me on hold... ANd this was about 20 minutes into the conversation. I won't bore you with the blow by blows, but I will say that both Audiovox and Sirius are very poor products and will tell everyone I know to avoid them both at all cost...
