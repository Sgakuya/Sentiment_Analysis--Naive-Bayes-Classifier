I read this book years ago and it was the first one of King's that i read. Reading it took me right into that town, right next to the guys fighting these things. I was thoroughly involved in this story as I had never been in a book before. It left me with a phobia about looking out windows at night, and God help me if any scratching noises were heard! The movie made with David Soul was so disappointing, if I had seen that first I would never had read the book.
