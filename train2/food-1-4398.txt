There aren't words to describe my distaste for these things.... the smell, the smell, the smell. I'd rather you snacked on pickled herring than Funyuns in my presence; however, Magellan's point is well-taken. Out of sheer principle I can't give these more than 1 star, but Funyuns were clearly produced by an evil genius hell-bent on world domination. Hilarious.
