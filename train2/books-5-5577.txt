This was an amazing book! It takes place one hundred years ago tells of the hardships people had to go through just to eat live. I had such compassion for the main character - what a strong woman - I don't know that I could survive all she did. This book definately made me appreciate the luxuries we are fortunate enough to have living in this age.
