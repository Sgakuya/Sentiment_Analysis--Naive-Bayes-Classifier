My company just switched over to a GSM plan at Cellular One by Dobson. We are located in NW PA, and previously had digital plans. After switching over to the GSM plan, about 15 of 30 employees (including myself) are completely unhappy with Cellular None. The other 15 do not extensively use their phones. On the digital plans, coverage was almost as good as Verizon, but now that GSM is here!, it is terrible in almost every respect. You must be in a major area (city over 5000 population) to even be able to use the phones. Verizon will work in almost every remote location in this area, as I have friends with the Verizon service. It's very embarrassing to borrow their phones because mine will not function 90% of the time. Even in full service areas, calls will get randomly dropped or one side of the conversation will get involuntarily muted. Here is a real kick-in-the-you-know-what: I called *611 on my now-deactivated digital TDMA phone to speak with Cellone customer service. I asked them to reactivate that old phone, but said they no longer support digital service. I said the new and improved technology doesn't work. I was rudely passed off as a nuisance caller, even after I filled out several trouble tickets. Every time I followed up on those, I got a different answer. I have been trying to get our corporate account manager to switch to Verizon, but he reminds me of that horrible contract we are stuck with. Will CellOne ever listen? Will they ever get my confidence back? After 6 months, they haven't made any progress!!! I would avoid them at all costs, and go with Verizon in the NW PA area. Or, get it in your contract to be able to get a full refund if coverage is not as promised. You'll be glad you did!!
