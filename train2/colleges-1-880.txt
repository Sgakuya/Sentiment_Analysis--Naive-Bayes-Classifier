I had a rotten time at UOP. You are constantly shuffled to team up with different people. They recruit new students, and I tell you I was stuck with some real winners! You have to work with these people to earn YOUR degree. I'm a BIG team player at work, so I am an advocate for work teams, however I am not when it comes to MY degree. Especially when I am teamed up with someone who knows nothing about Microsoft Office. Look who gets to do all the work!!!
