This is a true classic, a cornerstone work in lit noir. Tightly written, full of plausible plot twists, great use of language and the expression of the Philip Marlowe code of honor sets the standard for all sleuths to follow. Chandler was arguably the master of this genre, the model many have followed but none have surpassed.
