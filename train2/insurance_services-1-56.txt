I hate them! If you want to just give your money to an insurance company and never actually see a person this might be a company for you. But, for anyone that wants service they need to keep looking around. Supposedly when you don't pay your monthly rates your policy is cancelled. No problem, except that we didn't pay for two months before they actually cancelled it. Now they want nearly five hundred dollars and they sent it to a collection company. Total jerks!!!!
