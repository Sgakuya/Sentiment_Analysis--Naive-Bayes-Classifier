I say, "BEWARE OF DELAWARE", especially REHOBOTH BEACH. Summered there as a child, wonderful memories, moved there as an adult, big mistake. Small town corruption, police brutality, unfriendly neighbors, dirty beaches, need I say more. There are far better places to live and visit. Oh by the way, Delaware has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, so don't even think you will be treated fairly, you won't. If your family hasn't lived there since the 30's, you will always be an outsider.
