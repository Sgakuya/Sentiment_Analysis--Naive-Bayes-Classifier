Not only what numbah said, but the man has been brilliant as the host of Mail Call on the History Channel. Don't forget to grab the book based on the series. Numbah says it's chock full of cool history facts with enough irreverant comments straight from the gunny's pen. Smart guy with a smart mouth. :)
