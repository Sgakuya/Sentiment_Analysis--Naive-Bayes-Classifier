The Godfather is easily one of the worst movies of all time filled with senseless violence and not a likable character to be found...Apocolypse Now is a terribly depressing and dark war film...The Outsiders is exactly the kind of vision of the 50s I don't want to see--with depressing homelessness and gang violence. Coppola hasn't directed any good movies, that's for sure.
