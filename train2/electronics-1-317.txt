After reading excellent reviews for this phone, I purchased it at Circuit City for aprox. 130.00. I couldn't have been more disappointed. My purpose for spending this much on a phone was to get a phone without background fuzz and echo in the earpiece. Well that's what I got. This phone is not worth the money and we will be returning it. We tried moving the base, changing the security codes as they recommend but nothing helped. I am very disappointed in this phone. Not worth the money!
