I think this guy is one of the greatest contemporary artors! Thank God he is into independant films; his acting and participation brings so much credibility and audience to those films. Living in Oblivion and Tree's Lounge are two great movies if you're interested in seeing him at his best and in something other than supportive roles. Ghost World was good too but more supportive than carrying the movie.
