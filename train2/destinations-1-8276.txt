Overrated. We renamed it [quite cheesily] Wait-In-Line-Land, as that was all we did. Overpriced and undercleaned, overall I'd suggest Great America [with the awesome Top Gun rollercoaster... best I've ever been on, and I've been up and down California] or Six Flags [for Medusa and Kong rollercoasters] for an alternative amusement park.
