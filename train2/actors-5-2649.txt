edward norton is one of the most inspiring actors ever. I fisrt saw him in american history x, where he plays a reformed nazi. The way he played the role was so eneregetic, it had so much power, more then any other actors perfromance i've seen befor. Being a fellow training actor myself, I hope i can achieve the levels that edward has. Edward norton is an idol in my eyes and i model my acting capalities around him...
