I've always loved Jack Lemmon no matter what he was doing. His death shortly after that of Walter Mathau a few years ago was a tragedy and a deep loss for the entertainment industry. He brought us so many memoriable performances. The Odd Couple , Grumy Old Men , The Apartment , and Out to Sea . I just saw My Fellow Americans the other day which starred him and James Garner and I realized how much I truly miss having Jack Lemmon around to make me laugh with his outrageous performances. He and Mathau were truly the origional coupling who redefined comedy. Jack Lemmon was a wonderful actor who will be sorely missed.
