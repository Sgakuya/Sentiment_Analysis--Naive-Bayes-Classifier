I just don't get it... D1 sports, campus in the center of Atlanta, lots of Fraternities and Sororities; yet NO FUN WHATSOEVER! Think I'm kidding? Take a ride through campus on a Saturday night... you'll see like a dozen people (who probably just came from the library). Don't come here if you want a school with some spirit and enthusiasm. You'll get a great education here and a great job afterwards... but there a plenty of good schools where you can get a great education and have some fun while you're there as well. My $.02
