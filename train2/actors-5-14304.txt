I think Chloe is brilliant. I first saw her in Boys dont Cry , and thought she delivered a very convincing and moving performance. I was WOWED by her portrayal of Amy in If these walls could talk 2 - she is sexy and magnetic, and there is real chemistry between her and her on screen lover, Michelle Williams. Deffinately doesnt get enough credit for her work!
