She's the kind of girl that takes my breath away. And it lies beyond just her really nice looks. I think she gives the impression of beeing really smart and nice. Furthermore the thing that defines her is her twitches when she thinks... of course in movies. They make her look so sweet. She's my nbr.1 from the filmworld, along with charlize theron.
