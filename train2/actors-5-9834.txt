I think Reese is an awsome actress, but I didn't show much intrest in her until i saw FREEWAY, which was an awsome movie. She played the perfect cool chick, and I think she is one of the best female actresses in the world. I must say that she is a very lucky girl to have Ryan as her husband, but he also is a lucky man to have her as a wife. I think she should play more roles as a bad-ass cool chick, which she is very good at.
