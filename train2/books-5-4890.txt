I like how the same story is told from different points of view in 'Sound and the Fury'. You have to read the end to understand the beginning. It is an interesting portrayal of the mind of a 'retarded' person. It is interesting to learn about views of sex and relationships in the 1920's. Great symbolism involved. Each time a passage is read, something else pops into my mind.
