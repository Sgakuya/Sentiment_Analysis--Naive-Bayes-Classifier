Joan Fontaine was not only a great actress but also a wonderful human being. I admire her for her charitable work and for her many varied interests outside of Hollywood. She was great in Rebecca, Suspicion, Letter from an Unknown Woman, This above All, and many others. I think she was one of the screen most natural beauties.
