Pie (Freddie Prinze, Jr) is a wonderful actor. There's alot of girls out there that say they love him, but how can they say those words if they don't know the person, if they haven't felt what he's feeling, or been there with him or anywhere with him. Don't say the words if you don't feel it in your heart. I would like to meet the Prinze one day, but hopefully that day will come one day. Thanks, for my opinion.-Yours, forever**Jennifer**
