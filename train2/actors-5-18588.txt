He is a great director but obsessive. He had a long relationship with Klaus Kinski, but they wound up hating each other. See Kinski and Herzog in Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes, (Aguirre, the Wrath of God.) The English edition of Fitzcarraldo is ok but watch Aguirre in German with English subtitles.
