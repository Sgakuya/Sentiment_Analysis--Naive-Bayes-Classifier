The Divine Garbo was a unique screen presence - the terms otherworldly beauty , enigma , and mystique have been a bit overused when describing her, but that doesn't mean she didn't possess all those things. At times, her performances (as CastleBee touched on) seem rather cold to me, but perhaps that's because Greta was never 100% comfortable being a world famous movie-star.
