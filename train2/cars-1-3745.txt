Hey, it's your money. I just can't see spending that much on a car. I understand some people get off on the attention, but I'd rather have a normal vehicle and live more simply. Suburban guilt? Maybe, but I don't think I could look myself in the mirror knowing I had spent that much on a car when so many have so little.
