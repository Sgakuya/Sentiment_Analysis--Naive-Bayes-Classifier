In a fit of health-consciousness, I gave these cookies a try. Big mistake! They were devoid of flavor, and their texture and shape reminded me of an SOS pad. The chocolate coating was thin and waxy. I've never tasted insulation, but I feel certain that it would taste like a Snackwell's Devil's Food cookie. If you're going to eat a cookie, go for the real thing.
