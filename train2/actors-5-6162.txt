Branagh has ushered in the new age of Shakespeare acting and thank goodness. His performances (especially in Hamlet) are very quiet and intamite, not staged at all. Back in Oliver's day actor's performances were cold, falsely passionate and painfully staged. Now we seem to be moving toward a more conservative, intimate way of interprating Mr. Shakespeare works, and it can all be accredited to Mr. Branagh. Also, he makes me cry every time I watch Henry V, you know, in the end when he's carrying his dead page up the battle field. Tear.
