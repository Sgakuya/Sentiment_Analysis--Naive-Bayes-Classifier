This was a terrible book. Alex Haley is notorious for taking extreme liberty with the truth and facts in his writing. He has done this with Autobiography of Malcolm X . Autobiography? Leave it to Alex Haley. Malcolm X was a bigot, a racist, and a hate monger. He hated white people just because they were white. The current movement to try to make him a folk hero is very disturbing. We are setting a double standard here. Malcolm X was an extremist and a racist. Alex Haley's reinvention of the facts does not make him a good writer. It makes him a good distributor of propaganda.
