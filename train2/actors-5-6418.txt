Okay, to sum JJ up with one word: perfect! I mean this kid has looks, talent and has millions of girls chasing after him! He has this raw talent and potenial that no other actor has! I do think that he should cover a wide range of roles, and not just a typical teen guy. It would be cool to see him play like a father or something a long a different line. But other than that, this guy is awesome!
