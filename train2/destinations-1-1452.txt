Bonsoir, Hitler! Why, come on in, we will bend over for you, mon ami! And we will call the Americans to bail us out! And when they ask us for fly-over rights to bomb a dictator in Libya, we will thumb our noses, and then we will sell them WATER! HA HA! Only the Americans will buy WATER! Tres bien! Those stupid Americans will never stop buying our products, even after we try to stop them from killing our ami Saddam! Oh, MERDE! We f'd up!
