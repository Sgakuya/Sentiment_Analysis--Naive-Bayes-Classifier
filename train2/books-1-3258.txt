This book did not scare me- it revolted me. Disgusting prolonged sequences of sexual abuse- what was this trying to prove? The villain was shown to be guilty in the third chapter- where was the suspense? The ending wasn't statisfying- the villain dies, but isn't truly punished. The reader doesn't ever know if his other victims given evil hypnotic solutions were ever IDed and helped. Poor quality. Obvious rush job.
