If it's a Harrison Ford movie, I'll watch it! In the escapist roles like Indiana Jones and Han Solo, he portrays the classic rogue you can't help but like. In Mosquito Coast, his character was very different but equally riveting as he gradually deteriorated. Movies like Witness,and Six Days Seven Nights -- so different but the Ford character good in each. I found Sabrina disappointing, but that was more due to my comparing it to the original than any fault of Harrison Ford. I'm inclined to be favourably biased toward anything that he's in.
