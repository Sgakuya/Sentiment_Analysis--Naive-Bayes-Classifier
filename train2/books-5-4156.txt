The only true love story of our generation. These simple words, written by a professional reviewer about the relationship between the pedophile Humbert Humbert and the 12 year old Lolita, belie the power of Nabokov's writing. Nabokov, through his mastery of language and character development, is able make something horrifying into something touching and beautiful. Humbert is so open about his sickness, so vulnerable, so honest, so eloquent... that it is impossible not to empathize with him, as horrifying as that is. Lolita is perhaps the most daring, touching, and well-written novel I have ever read - a true masterpiece for a variety of reasons. Read this book.
