Wouldn't it be great if a progressive like Sinclair could come along today and throw out all the right-wing trash by exposing their lies. Although The Jungle (misnamed Jungle on this site) isn't directly about such, that was one of its impacts. Of all the books I've read, this one has affected me more politically, ideologically and spiritually than any other. I have a list of heroes to remind me of good deeds in the world and Sinclair is on that list. I HIGHLY recommend this book to everyone.
