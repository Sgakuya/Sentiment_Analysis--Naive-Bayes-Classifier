Like many of the other Dish customers I feel I'm not getting what I pay for. Any time it Rains or Snows you loose signal. We are Paying for The Works Top 150 and all the Movie Channels, but we continually loose the Satellite Signal. I'm about ready to go back to cable, and call the last 2 years a lost cause.
