Sure, she's sexy, but can she act. The answer is NO WAY IN HELL!!! She stumbles around with a goofy look on her face, is as articulate as a stuttering camel on pep pills and has the acting ability of a Furby. Oh, but that's fine as long as she looks good, right? She can stumble around and over-act every line as long as she's sexy? Pfft! Yeah, right! Not to mention that she undeservingly becomes praised as a great actress just because she married Brad Pitt! Suddenly she goes from not only being the worst actress, but also the most overrated.
