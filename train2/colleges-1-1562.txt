Academically suspect training ground for professional killers and troublemakers. I've never met a West Point graduate who was capable of being anything more than a chain of command yesman. They apparently don't teach one how to think independently at this dump, and the only creative thinking that is encouraged is how to rain death on unarmed, defenseless civilian populations in third world countries. You have to wonder what kind of person would even want to go to a toilet like this.
