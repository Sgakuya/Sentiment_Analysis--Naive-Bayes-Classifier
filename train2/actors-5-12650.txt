OMG, I love Charlize!! She's great..my favorite actress. I have pictures of her all over my walls and I only watched the award shows like The Oscars just to see her. She is extremely talented and amazingly beautiful. She came to the US from South Africa all alone when she was a teen and was discovered in a bank when they refused to cash her check. That is one ballsy lady..1: B/c she survived on her own in a country she had never been to before; 2: For flipping out like that on the dude working in the bank that refused her check. You have guts, Char! And you deserved to win those awards in 2004 for Monster. You're beautiful and talented, keep on acting! Love, your biggest fan.
