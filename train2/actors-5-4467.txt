Personally, I think he's cute and all (although not quite my age - him being 25 years older than me) but i think he is such an absolute ***** for wanting to quite the X-files, he thinks he will get offers left and right from movie directors and in interviews he speaks as though he is a great Actor but the painful truth is that he isn't great, and not a particular 'actor' he plays basically himself in the x-files and just cause he got a part in a crap film - return to me - doesn't mean he'll be that lucky in the future. I feel sorry for Gillian for having to work with him. Well, anyway, he's cute. I'm Out.
