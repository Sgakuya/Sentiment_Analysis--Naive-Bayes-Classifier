I grew up watching Nicolas Cage. Peggy Sue Got Married is still one of my favorite movies. Words can't begin to describe how wonderful Nicolas is. Family Man. , Face/Off. , and Gone In 60 Seconds are really really excellent movies. I hope he finds happiness with Lisa Presley...he deserves happiness.
