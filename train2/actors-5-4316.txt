I have only seen a few movies that have Jeff Bridges in 'em but i loved them all except for the Big Labowski or however you spell it, the only funny thing was that he was called The Dude, but as for the Movie if you havn't seen it, don't! His best flick was The Mirror Has Two Faces I love that movie infact it is my favorite movie ever.
