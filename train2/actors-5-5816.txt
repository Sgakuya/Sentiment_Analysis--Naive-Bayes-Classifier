Wow, this is truly an unjust rating. Leonardo is a fine actor, not De Niro, but he's definitely up there. Check out This Boy's Life, Whats Eating Gilbert Grape, Romeo and Juliet, Basketball Diaries, and Catch me if you Can. I, as a straight man, feel he is being unfairly rated because people think he just gets by on being a hearthrob to the girls. Thats just not true. Look at the roles he takes, he could be another Freddie Prinze Jr., taking soft easy fluffy roles that will deliver the big checks and secure a loyal following among teenage girls, but he instead chooses to go after challenging roles and I admire that. Heard he's doing Alexander the Great next, I will look forward to that. Leo is one of the rare actors that makes a movie worth watching no matter how bad it may be.
