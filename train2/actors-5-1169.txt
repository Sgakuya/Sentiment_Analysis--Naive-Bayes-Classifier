Wow!! There should be a number 6 rating and say incredible!! From playing a dog loving cop to a ww2 veteran he can do it all. I think he is the greatest actor of all time. I am gonna try for a carrer in showbiz b/c he has insipered me so much. I see him on every talk show and when I watch him I get a wonderful feeling about him and I start to cry. He is so amazing. I wish I could meet him somday!!!
