AmSouth puts a one day hold on all non-Amsouth checks that you depsoit into your account. It dosen't matter how long you have had the account nor how much $$ is in your account. If there is a policy, such as the previous one, that you are unaware of and this policy causes you to have an NSF charge, too bad. I am told that AmSouth's fees are non refundable!
