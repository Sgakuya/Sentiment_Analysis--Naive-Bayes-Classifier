Christian Bale is by far the most versitle actor since, since... well, forget it no one compares. If you're looking for deep, moving, penetrating characters follow Bale's movie trail and all other fail. He can BE anything he choses, he just understands a story, a role and simply ACTS. And seems to live his personal life like your next door neighbor. No drugs, no antics just a regular guy. (Now, why don't my neighbors look like that?)
