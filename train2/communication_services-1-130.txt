STOP CALLING ME!! and Stop sending me offers in the mail! In the past two days I have received two promotional offers from MCI if I switch over. Yesterday it was a $50 gift card from Blockbuster. Switching over is fine and easy, it's once I am there that stinks! Very POOR Customer service..varying rates..confusing bill. I'll stick with AT T.
