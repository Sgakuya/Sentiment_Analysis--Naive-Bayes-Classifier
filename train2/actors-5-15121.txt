Kirsten Dunst has always put in fine performances, what I've seen, anyway. The first time I saw her was when she played the difficult role of Claudia, the ill-fated vampire child in Interview With The Vampire. The latest thing I saw her in was Spiderman, and she put in another top notch performance.
