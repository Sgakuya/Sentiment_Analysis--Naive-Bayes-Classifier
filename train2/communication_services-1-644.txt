I have been with Cingular for three days and now will be cancelling my service. I just had the worst customer service experience of my life. 5 hours on the phone with 8 different reps, none had the slightest clue what they were doing. Attide ranging from inept to rude. Has beeen hanged up on once. Last rep ttransferred me to a Cingular department which regular business hours were over. That was the end of it, After 5 hours on teh phone I am nowhere near resolution of my problem which was to exchange a defective phone that I had for only three days.
