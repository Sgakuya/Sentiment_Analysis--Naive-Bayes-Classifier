I love the accessibility and comprehensiveness of this cookbook. It has over 1500 recipes with diagrams and variations. Plus it has sections on kitchen, equipment, and technique basics. In typical Bittman fashion, the recipes are rather minimalist, yet delicious! No super long list of unusual ingredients and no jumping on the trend toward funky international recipes, although there are some well-established international entries, such as Chicken Adobo, a Philippine classic.
