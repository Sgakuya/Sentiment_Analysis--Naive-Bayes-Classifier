I first noticed Charlize in one of my favorite movies, That Thing You Do , as Guy Patterson's girlfriend who dumps him for a dentist. She was so cool as a 50's girl - and her timeless elegance carries over into all of her roles. I thought she was great in Devil's Advocate as the vulnerable and disturbed wife. The thing I like about all of her roles is that she chooses them for their vulnerability and their flaws, not because they showcase her glamour-girl looks. In every interview of her that I have read, she has come across as so sensible, level-headed, and, well, non-diva-like. Plus, the girl has style and always looks beautiful. Snaps to her stylist. I'll continue to seek out her movies, no matter what the critics say.
