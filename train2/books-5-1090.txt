Read Amelia Bedelia books to your children and your children's children. These clever stories shouldn't be forgotten. I laughed a great deal at Amelia's adventures, cutting up calendars when making a date cake, running to her house when told to run home playing baseball... I'm sure they help to develop a kid's sense of humor.
