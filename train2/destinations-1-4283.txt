A stupid southern city that boomed for about 4 months, and now really sucks, i drive through there a lot when traveling up and down the east coast. The most interesting thing there is a 30 foot tall cigarette. The whole place smells like old tobacco or something, it is horrible. I hate cigarettes to begin with.
