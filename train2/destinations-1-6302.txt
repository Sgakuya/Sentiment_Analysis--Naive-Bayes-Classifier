Correction, I didn't mean that there isn't racism in Detroit. I was addressing the diversity issue. Some people may consider this area to be ethnically diverse considering the concentration of African Americans. Racism exist every where. People just seem to be more open with their feelings or more blatant with it in Ohio. Miserable in Toledo Ohio
