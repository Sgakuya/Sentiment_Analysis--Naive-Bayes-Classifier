People follow what this guy says because he seems to be the very opposite of the establishment, of pollitical correctness, but truth be told he is exactly what he hates: a guy/system that sucks the life (and dollars) of a newfound ultra business: telling the world that the country he belongs to is crap. Instead of making things better what Mr. Moore does is become the flag that anti american people all over the world wave, quoting his documentaries, believing his facts, even more so because he IS IN FACT AN AMERICAN. A true artist, should be diverse. A true american would criticize his country by proposing alternatives. Mr. Moore is neither. (P.S.: that interview with Heston was the lamest piece of journalism I have ever witnessed: 0 ethic whatsoever)
