Lucy is the all-time Queen of common-man humour. She did slapstick with perfect precision and timing. Her other work (the B-movie) stuff, just was not her element. I STILL watch these shows, and STILL laugh, even thought I have seen VitaMeataVegamin at least 500 times. Delivery is EVERYTHING! And she had it down to a science.
