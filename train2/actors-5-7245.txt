I had such a crush on him for so long. He is so great looking, and sexy. I just really wish he'd make wiser decisions about the films he's in. He has done some great things, but also some pretty bad stuff too. He is underutilized. Even so, at least he's fabulous to watch even in the worst. I'd really like to see him come into his own. B-movies are ok for a while, but ....he deserves more.
