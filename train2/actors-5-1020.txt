Tom Hanks has been in 33 movies from Splash until The Polar Express, coming out later this year. He is 45th on the top 100 stars on the 1980's list, 1st on the 1990's list, and 90th on the 2000's list. He's won 2 oscars from Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. Not too many actors could say that. He is an actor who can act the most various kinds of roles. He never plays the same kind of character in each of his movies, and what makes him great is that he does each well. Some actors are only good for comedy movies, etc. But Tom Hanks can act in all different kinds of movies and that takes much talent.
