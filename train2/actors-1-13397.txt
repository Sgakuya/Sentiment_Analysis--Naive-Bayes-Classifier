Most actresses can change voices and appearance for roles they play. Not so Demi Moore...she plays Demi Moore throughout each role. Her acting skills are neglible so she has to rely on peeling off her clothes to get the male cinema audience paying to see her films. Demi Moore must be having a jolly good laugh at the guillibilty of her fans .
