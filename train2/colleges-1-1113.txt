Life Sciences: good for biological sciences, but the other majors are b.s.; Human Ecology: total garbage (how many H.S. seniors wish to declare textiles and management and a probable major?) ILR: total garbage; Art Architecture: terrible for the former, good for the latter; Hotel Administration: party school, where Cornell gets a lot of its athletes.
