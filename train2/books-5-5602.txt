Philip Roth is probably my favorite contemporary author. I stumbled across Sabbath's Theater very much by accident, and it hooked me from the first page. Roth is agressively intelligent, refreshingly unconstrained by convention, and famously prolific. He cranks out about a book a year, and the quality stays high. While Sabbath's Theater remains my favorite of his books, I also enjoyed Portnoy's Complaint and the more recent American Pastoral.
