Tennesee is rated near the last in: Education, Services and health for children, Little or no services for the edlerly, poor envirionment, high degree of poverty, health care in general not available to many in the populace, intolerant populace toward Gays, and other minorities not of 'White Christian' background. There must BE some truth to why this state is rated so LOW- if you cannot handle the truth- too BAD!
