University of Phoenix is a complete waste of time and money. The online experience is like no other! They misrepresent their programs and then once enrolled, they change midstream. When enrolling for the program I was told that I needed to log into the computer 3 out of 7 days, but once classes started it was 5 out of 7. This may not sound like a big deal for some, but most people in a MBA distance/online program are there as more of a convienence. I have found that it is easier to sit in a live class 1 night a week oppossed to being online nearly every day. Another HUGE turnoff was the group work. Instructors paired the class into teams and assigned papers, projects and power point presentations. Sounds simple, but when one member of the team does not do their share...everyone suffers! I am all for being a team player, but not when it comes to my education. I believe this is something and individual needs to achieve on their own! STUDENTS BEWARE!!!!!
