I found this book easy to read, with a simple language and style, yet very insightful. The personality of the narrator is well developed, and I felt that I could really identify with him and understand his thoughts and feelings, even though he is so different from me in terms of attitude. This book was an enlightening glimpse into the life and mind of another human being.
