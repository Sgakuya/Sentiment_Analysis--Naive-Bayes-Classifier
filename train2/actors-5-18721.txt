A guy who has made an astonishing numberof films that I love. All the way back to his short movie days Vincent Frankenweenie up to Sleepy Hollow and Planet of the apes . I think they are all great in their own way. Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice are his best as is Batman. I hope he makes many more films. A fantastic visionary.
