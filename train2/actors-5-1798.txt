Very talented, with an interesting, unique take on his varied roles. Depp has evolved into one of the more fascinating actors in the biz today. Can't help it; can't take my eyes off him when he's on screen. That one little glance over the shoulder in Pirates of the Caribbean could only be described as delightfully devastating. Great range, quirky style and character interpretation and genuinely hot.
