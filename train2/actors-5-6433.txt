Like a lot of you, I am obsessed with this cutie from the Creek. I can't pin point when exactly it was that he got me, but the Duck movies were big when I was little. I would love to say I met him and that's why I think he should get 5 stars. But the fact remains, he entertains me and keeps me watching. He can, well could have, seeing as the boat is gone. Taken me anywhere in True Love!
