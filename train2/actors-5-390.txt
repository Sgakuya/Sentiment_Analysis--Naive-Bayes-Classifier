Mitchum was one of a kind in the movies. He personified the strong, silent loser in the film-noir RKO films of the forties. He was the adventurer in bigger productions. And he conveyed the psychotic killer perfectly. The fact that he never looked like he was acting made it too easy to believe that he didn't. But, he took a part and found the core of it. Then he fleshed it out with a passion that smoldered under the skin. He called himself the biggest whore in Hollywood because he would sell his talent for money to anyone. Along the way he made some great pictures.
