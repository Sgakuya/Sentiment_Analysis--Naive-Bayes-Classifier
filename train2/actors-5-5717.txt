I was in about the 10th grade when he was born so I kind of feel like a lecherous old bag saying this but what a cutie! I was not an original fan of ER just started watching it in re-runs a few months ago but I am very impressed with the work he has done on this show. I also recall a scene in a movie he did quite awhile before the series in which he has a death scene that really stood out in my mind - very realistic and moving. I see him as having the potential to be around the biz for a long time to come.
