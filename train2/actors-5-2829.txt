I just saw American Beauty last night, and without a doubt, Kevin Spacey is the best actor in the business at this time. He rarely misses on his choices of roles ( Breakout ). He was outstanding in The Usual Suspects and in L.A. Confidential . His character in Seven made me sympathize with Brad Pitt. I enjoyed his performance in The Negotiator , but I think he will be long remembered for the role of Lester Burnham in American Beauty . Most 'mid-life crisis' movies allow the man to get the young girl and show them having sex, but not here. He brought real feeling to the character and made the audience really care about what happened to him. I hope Kevin keeps up the quality of his performances for a long time. Hollywood needs him.
