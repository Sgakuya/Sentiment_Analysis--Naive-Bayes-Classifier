Time Warner cable in columbia south carolina is an absolute joke. I grew up with a c-band dish and then switched to directv years later. Never had a problem with either service. When I moved to Columbia I was forced to sign up for cable. It got so bad I decided to go without tv for months. I finaly decided to resign with directv. Thank God.
