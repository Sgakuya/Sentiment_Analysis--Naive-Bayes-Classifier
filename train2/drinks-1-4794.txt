Quite simply one of the most disgusting drinks I ever had the pleasure of tasting. I am shocked that some people find this drink not too sweet. I mean, this is one of the sweetest things I've ever tasted in my life. More, that spicy flavor tastes NOTHING like real fruit (and especially nothing like prune). Imagine putting about twenty cinnamon candies in carbonated water, then drink that; that's how BAD this drink is.
