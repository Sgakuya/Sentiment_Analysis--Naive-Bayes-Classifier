I made the mistake of signing a contract for two phone services(one for me one for my daughter whowas to pay her own bill) with Cellular One Dec. 18, 2000 - I tried to cancel my contracts Aug. 2000 after several month s of being promised an extended calling area was in the works which would include my work area. Erroneous bills, inflated costs regarding coverage area, roaming, and long distance calls made the service a nightmare! READ THE FINEPRINT!!! I have not used this service since Aug. because they can't get the billing right and won't correct errors. The employees in the local office and the regional office don't communicate (no communication wireless or other). Jan. 2 I went to the local office to get a final bill and was told the bill was $355 ($200 added for failure to fulfill the contract - surprise) I paid $50 on this bill leaving a $305 balance and requested an itemized final bill be mailed to me. I was told this would be done. Instead, on Jan. 16th I received a call at work from a collection agency advising this had been turned over to them in the amount of $455 ($50 credit not posted and $100 collection fee added - it's in the contract - READ THE FINEPRINT!!) I have spoken with people in the Celluar One Office local, regional, and collections. FInal answer - pay the $455 or have this listed on your credit report as a bad debt.READ THE FINEPRINT!! aS FOR THOSE GIVING cELLULAR oNE A GOOD RATING - read the fineprint!!@
