Repellent beyond words, but I'll try.... Nope, can't do it. Just...I can't bear the idea that this family is presented as wholesome and healthy and therefore as an ideal. I'm not a big fan of cutsie kiddy comics at the best of times and combining this with the truly vomit worthy drawing gives the Family Circus a place in the comics Hall of Shame.
