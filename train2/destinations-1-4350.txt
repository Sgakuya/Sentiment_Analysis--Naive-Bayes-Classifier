I was not born in LA, but boy was I shocked when I moved here for school. The people are totally self-centered and cold. People also drive like maniacs, and even if you're trying to merge into another lane,...the car in the next lane comes speeding down the street as if that jerk wants to bang you. Look at the majority of the cars in the LA freeways and local streets...lots of dents and bumpers ready to fall off. The smog. OMG! Smog is so terrible I could smell it! I am so f-cking afraid that I will get cancer from it. In addition, people here are scum bags when it comes to doing business. They love to rip customers off. It happened to me TWICE. Lastly, Los ANgelenos are so anal about saying things. They want people to say certain words in their own way. I once went to a restaurant to order a cup of orange juice. The waitress told me It's not orange juice, it's orange drink. Sheesh..who gives a f-ck! The one thing I can't wait for is to graduate from my school, and get my a$$ outta smog land.
