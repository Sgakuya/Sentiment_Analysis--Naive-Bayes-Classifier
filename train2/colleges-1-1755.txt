USC is such a lousy institute. It has a big name, but doesn't focus much on academics and research. Although USC is a private institute, a lot of the classes are HUGE. Some instructors are a-holes, students are rude and a-holes, and frat and greek life seems to be the center of student life at USC. It was a culture shock for me when I first went to SC. I would never go back ...NEVER!
