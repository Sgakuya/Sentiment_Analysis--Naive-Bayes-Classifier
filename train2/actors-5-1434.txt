Jack Nicholson deserves his spot on this list, as he truly is one of the greatest actors probably of all time. In every film that I've ever seen him in, he's always brought something special to the screen. I really loved this man for his excellent performance as The Joker in Batman. However, I have two films that are both my favorite Nicholson films- Terms of Endearment and As Good as it Gets . Both films are in the Romantic-Comedy genre, and his performance in both were memoriable, espescially in the latter, where he played the role of the superstitious Marvin Udall so well. He was also impressive in The Crossing Guard , Wolf , A Few Good Men and The Plege . I'm sure that Anger Management will be another great film too.
