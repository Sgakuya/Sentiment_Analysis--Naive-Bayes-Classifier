He is an ignorant BUFFOON! That obese pacifist has not the physical stamina nor intestinal fortitude to run with the big dogs; instead, he along with all of the other wimpy, lazy pups want to whine and howl from the porch instead!!! Here's a proposition for you Michael (and all of the other whiney war protesters): since you are so damn against what our soldiers are doing to save YOUR asses (your homes, your families' well- being, your FREEDOM and FUTURE), then why don't YOU go to these countries and solve these conflicts for the rest of us!!!! Let's see how far you get! Sorry, your celebrity status won't help you much here, I'm afraid. Oh, and try talking to some of the foreign leaders in the same tone in which you trash our President and our country; you take for granted that we don't punish our insubordinates the way that their countries do. You just don't get it, do you? I'd lay a bet that once the security blanket (ie: FREEDOM) is abruptly yanked from your fat little hands, you would suddently appreciate the efforts that our President and armed forces are putting forth to keep you fed, and pacified, and which also affords you the luxury of blasting your ignorant opinions where IT NEVER WILL BE DESIRED! Shut your trap Michael; go through basic training--you need the workout, both physically and mentally! You are a disgraceful IDIOT!
