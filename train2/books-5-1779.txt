I feel a great aesthetic loss in not having the opportunity to see more than half a dozen or so Pogo strips, but what I have seen is great and lives up to Kelly's reputation. I have a few of the Pogo comic books which Kelly drew prior to bringing it to newspapers..I'll have to give those a look sometime. Anyway, from the admittedly little I have seen, I agree that Kelly was a genius. (Plus he was from Philly just like me!)
