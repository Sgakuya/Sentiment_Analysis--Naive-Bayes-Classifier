Brilliant!That's the only word I can use to describe this guy. I hate to sound like a broken record, but Joaquin's performance in Gladiator was out of this world.He definitely should have won an oscar for that role.His eyes radiate such...intensity! He not only potrays a character in his movies,he IS the character! This guy will go down as one of the greats,you all just wait and see!
