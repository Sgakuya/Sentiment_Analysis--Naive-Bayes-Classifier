Hey Astre, abdul689 is right. First all of all, the Rocky movies are classic, and Sylvester Stallone did more for the profession of acting in Cliffhanger (one of his smaller films), than Jason Isaacs will do in his entire career. I won't even bother to try and compare Rocky Balboa to Colonel Tavington, as the Italian stallion kicks Tavington's proverbial ass. Abdul689, please do not be bullied by these Isaacs wackos, and remain true to your convictions. If you need any further inspiration to stand tall, all you need to do is to think of Sly playing the arm wrestler Lincoln Hawk in Over the Top - that should do the trick. Peace.
