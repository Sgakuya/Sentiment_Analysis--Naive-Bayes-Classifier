I have read several of his books, including All Creatures Great and Small and James Herriot's Dog Stories and I really enjoyed reading them. I think James Herriot is a good descriptive author. I felt like I was actually with him in Darrowby, watching him perform his veterinary work. I think his books have the perfect mixture of comedy and drama. I recommend James Herriot's books for anyone who likes to read good animal stories.
