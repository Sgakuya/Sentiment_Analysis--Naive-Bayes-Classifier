She has been acting for the majority of her life, and it shows. I think she has truly mastered the talent in front of and behind the camera. She was believable and heart wrenching in Accused . She brought the audience with her throughout her journy in Contact starting off with her strong willed attitude..we then remember her father with her and then complete the spiritual journey with her, to a land she never expected. She is clearly versatile and talented.
