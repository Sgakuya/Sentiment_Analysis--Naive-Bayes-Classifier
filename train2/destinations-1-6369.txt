I moved to Knoxville, TN 6 months ago and i hate it here. Lots of ignorant, uneducated, backwards people everywhere you turn in this city and this is supposed to be a college town! All they care about here is the vols and guns. Lots of overweight folks, probably due to the fact that Knoxville is King when it comes to bad fast food places, hardly any decent places to eat at here. There is NOTHING to do in this city and if you are single and over 30, you are out of luck. I've lived in over 10 different cities in my life and Knoxville and east TN is by far the worst, the locals will tell you different but that's because they don't know any better, they all claim Knoxville is exciting and lots to do here... yeah right, lots to do if you like white trash culture! Combine that with lots of smokers and some of the worst air in the Summer that hangs over this region and it makes east TN a bad place to live. As for the Smoky mountains, yeah they are nice but nothing that great, The Rockies in Co. are FAR better and anyone that's been to CO. will know what i mean. Oh, they hate northeners here too, guess they are still bitter about the Civil War, get over it people!! I can't wait til i move out of TN (which will be soon) and to a REAL state with smarter people.
