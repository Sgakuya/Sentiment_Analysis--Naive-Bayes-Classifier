Most of those who have rated the USA have been American themself - it's like sending yourself a Valentine's Day card to make yourself look good, quite pathetic. I hate America - the country where a 7 year old kid got charged with drug dealing because she gave a friend having a bad asthma attack an asthma inhaler. There are so many Americans around that the bottom of the genetic barrel is scraped clean, with nutters, psycopaths, thick bastards and people so ugly they shouldn't be let out. Money rules everything, everyone sues everyone for anything, everyone thinks that America is best at everything and the rest of the world couldn't do without them. America is so fat on it's own wealth that people can afford to eat far too much and end up weighing hideous amounts and becoming abominations. Everyone is so idealistic and can't handle it when there isn't a happy ending to a film. There's plenty more I could say but it would take a while. The country itself is nice, it's just full of tossers.
