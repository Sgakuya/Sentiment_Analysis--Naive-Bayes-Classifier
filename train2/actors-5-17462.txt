Robin Christopher is the best actress that ever walked the face of this Earth! She has so much class and beauty, and so does Skye! If you don't like Robin or Skye then you need to go to the mental hospital. (I'm serious, people.) I am going to have to totally disagree with you there, PinkLady3! How can you not care for her character? She was the best ever on all 3 of the soaps, and she is better than anyone else ever can be! :D
