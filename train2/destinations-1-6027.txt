AZ has some nice areas- Prescott and Sedona- and the Grand Canyon is nice when the smog and haze to not block the views. Phoenix is a hot- and growing hotter mess. With smog that would make a former Los Angeleno like myself be proud. Crime is bad as well. And as many phonies (if not more) then in CA.
