I bet he's sorry for 'Lifeforce' but that's all he'd be sorry for and thankfully not to many noticed him in at as it was a bit role really. He was pretty darn impressive in Exculibur and I think I would have to say that I've liked him in almost all his roles. He delivers a great and engaging performance. Patrick, you can captain my ship anytime. Better still I have a Pit Boss that needs sorting out and I think a little time learning some of your wisdom would be money well spent. Please do more movies and you've got a pretty darn good physique so why not get into some hard-hitting intelligent action roles. I look forward to seeing more of my man Patrick but untill then I will have to make do with re-runs of Star Trek and his other movies. Check him out in Safehouse, Conspiracy Theory(with Mel Gibson) and Masterminds. I would really love to see his theatre performances too as I know that he does alot of Shakespear.
