The phone is ok but the customer service is just terrible. Long waits, hang ups, the customerr service reps transfer you endlessly with at least a 15 minute wait at each transfer. The website is hard to use and requires endless passwording. This is by far the worst customer service I have ever gotten from any company - ever!!!
