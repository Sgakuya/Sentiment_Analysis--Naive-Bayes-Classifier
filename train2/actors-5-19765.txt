Jonathan Taylor Thomas is a terrific actor. If he chooses to make films that are targeted at the younger audiences it's his choice. I personally think it's great that he is avoiding all of the oversexed teen roles out there. He is a positive role model for the younger people who watch his movies. He always has been and I hope he always will be. If sometime in the future, when he feels it's right, he choses to do something mature , it's his decision and he shouldn't get any crap about it either. I'm happy that he has his own mind and can choose for himself what he wants to do. Stay strong JTT!
