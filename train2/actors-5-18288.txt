Stanley Kubrick did not make movies. Stanley Kubrick made motion pictures. LITERALLY! Every one of his films that I've seen (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, THE SHINING, FULL METAL JACKET) looks like a photograph miraculously put into motion. Stanley Kubrick is undeniably the greatest director of all time, second to only Alfred Hitchcock of course.
