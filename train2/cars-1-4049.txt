Scarey! I thought Japan wanted to take over the US vehicle market - well I hope the Jap's are looking over their shoulder cause here come the Korean's big time. How do you say Dumping in Korean? Of course the UAW Korean local doesn't mind cause it keep's their members making $5.00 a week. Great vehicle for the money. Sort of like an Escape on steroids with the bulging fender and such. Go Hyundai beat Toyota at the cloaning game. Geez I wonder what Hundiii will call their Luxury Division? Can hardly wait to see the Luxury Sante Fe (Las Vegas QX40). Isn't FREEDOM wonderful!!
