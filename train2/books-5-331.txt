At first blush, this book appears to be a good--but merely good--collection of ideas, some of which can help readers market and sell themselves better. On a second read, you realize that the clear and simple prose of this--and his later books--disquises something far more sophisticated: a genuine insight into how people think and act, and how customers and clients choose the companies and people who provide their services. These are valuable insights as well as many very good suggestions for how to build a more successful business and a more satisfying life.
