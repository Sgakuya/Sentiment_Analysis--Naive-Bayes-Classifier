What is so brilliant about Viggo as an actor is his incredible diversity. I became aware of who he was when I watched Lord of the Rings, only to realize that I had already seen him in a whole bunch of other movies. I just didn't realize who he was because he blends in so well. He doesn't just act characters, but he becomes them. He's incredibly committed and invested in his roles. He's not interested in becoming a star, only in the quality of his material. I was particularly impressed with his role as a drill seargent in G.I Jane (even though the movie was horrid). He was almost completely unrecognizable, but deliciously ignorant and malicious. Of course Lord of the Rings is his finest performance to date in my opinion. Aragorn is my favourite character from the book and Viggo brought him to life perfectly. He has that sense of history and age, of someone lives up to his duty and yet struggles with his past at the same time. Other notable roles are : A Perfect Murder, A Walk on the Moon, The Prophecy (short but extremely memorable perforamance as the devil)
