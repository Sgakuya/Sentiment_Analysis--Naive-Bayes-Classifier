Who doesn't love her? I mean, she's got one hell of a voice and she's a great actress! My mom saw her in person, and man, was she cool! That sounded kinda corny, but oh well. She was a great Mary Poppins, and I was a Sound of Music Addict. She's also classy and has real charm. 3 I know there's a gazillion peeps ready to jump on my case, but I just love her!
