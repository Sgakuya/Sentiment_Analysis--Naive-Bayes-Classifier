Don't get me wrong, I love Cary's films and was a handsome and capable actor. I just choke on the irony that many people adored him, and his awesome image, and he was a homosexual (or at least bisexual). The rumours were very much substantiated, and (for the record) someone marrying a woman doesn't make them straight, just married. Just goes to show how Hollywood can hide elements of actor from the public. Anyway, he should be remembered as the great performer he was.
