i don't like starbucks, starbucks just can't make a good cup of coffee, at least anywhere around here. sure they may buy quality beans but what good are they if they're horribly over-roasted. and hiring local teens at low wages doesn't help at all either. im not saying it's bad everywhere , but a huge company like starbucks can't supply a good consistent cup of coffee or espresso to people who really love coffee.
