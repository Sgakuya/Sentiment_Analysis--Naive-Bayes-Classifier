If there is one word to decribe Julia Roberts it's: OVERRATED! I'm sorry, but I can't stand her acting. I swear everytime she makes a movie she uses the same character but just changes the name.I don't think she deserved her Oscar. I saw Erin B. and I wasn't impressed at all. I know alot of people like her acting, but I don't see why.
