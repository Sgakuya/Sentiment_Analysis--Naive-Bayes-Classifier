This school is horrible! The student life is virtually non-existent, upper-level administration is more concerned with the success of certain athletic programs, and the educational facilities need serious repair. I attended NC for a few years and found that I was paying a premium price with no reward. While some students (especially Lutherans) are given additional financial aid, the average student's aid decreased from year to year. I found that by the time I completed two years at NC, my financial aid had dwindled and I was forced to cover the additional cost.
