Another of the greats in my mind. One of the best daily strips ever done, with a wicked sense of (occasionally self-depracating) humor and sarcasm, loveable characters and a strong political sense. A mix of Doonesbury and Peanuts . Simply brilliant. Mr. Breathed, if you are listening, please bring back this marvellous strip!
