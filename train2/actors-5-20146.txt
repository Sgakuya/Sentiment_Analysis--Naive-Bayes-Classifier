Courteney Cox Arquette is my favorite actress ever,and everyone who is calling her anorexic is crazy,she may look really thin,but she is not anorexic.She has said, that she "would not through up if you paid her,that is the most disgusting thing in the world." So don't be up in her bussiness like that! You don't know her,and neither do I,but you shouldn't judge her.Is that the kind of support you would show for your friends who had anorexia?!?! don't think so,unless you're that kind of "friend".Anyways,maybe you haven't heard of dieting?!?! Whoever is saying that,is probably just jealous because you're not famous,and pretty,and talented like her.I'm not saying you have to like her,but don't call her anorexic,because she's not.I've seen all of her movies,(almost),and she's great in them.I really loved her in FRIENDS,playing Monica!Monica is sort of like me,neat freak,and doesn't try to keep stuff to herself.She's great!I have the 6th and 8th complete seasons of FRIENDS,and the top 5 from seasons 1,3,and 4.She has played alot of different characters,and plays them really well.That's what you call a good actress,but she not only plays them well,but she plays them by showing her talent,that's what I call a terrific actress!She has helped me pursue acting.At first I wanted to model and act,but that's only because Courteney Cox did.I found out that I am very dramatic,and I love to act!Well i could go on forever about her,but i'm sure other people would want to write something too!Courteney Cox is my favorite actress,ever.I loved her in FRIENDS and scream.She's an awesome actress.I love her.Hopefully,one day,I will get the chance to meet her,in person!That's my dream!I LOVE YOU,COURTENEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
