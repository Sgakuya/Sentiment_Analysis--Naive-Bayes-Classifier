For an actress who received three best actress Oscar nominations during her career, Eleanor Parker is criminally overlooked today. She received her first nomination for 'Caged' (1950), the best women's prison film ever made, as an innocent girl who's sent to prison and corrupted by the system. A brilliant performance by the gorgeous and talented Eleanor Parker.
