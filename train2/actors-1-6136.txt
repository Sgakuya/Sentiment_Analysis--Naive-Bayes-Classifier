THE MOST OVERRATED ACTOR (I mean person who is in movies) IN HOLLYWOOD! He's absolutely terrible! I only liked JFK and Field Of Dreams, Dances With Wolves was OK, but I just hate him. Should be kicked out of the business. All he does is use the same face, playing the same person. Can't do anything else. Absolutely talentless. The Postman can't be called a movie. Summary: TERRIBLE.
