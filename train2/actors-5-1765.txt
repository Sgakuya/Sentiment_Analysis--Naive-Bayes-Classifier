Probably the coolest actor alive today. Seriously, if anyone else who is really cool stands too close to Walken, the coolness critical mass may be reached and like, annihilate the universe. He has perfected the art of deadpan comedy as well as serious acting, and is a terrific dancer to boot. No one else can be so funny while hinting at extreme violence, except maybe for Steve Buscemi (who, according to the above rule, can never be in the same building as CW). Ironically, his least cool moment is probably the Fatboy Slim video, but it is still light years cooler than anything else that bloated limey has ever done. His presence improves any movie or TV show. I wish I were him, and would gladly age the thirty or so years if I could.
