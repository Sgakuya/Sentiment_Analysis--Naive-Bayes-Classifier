My friends and I went to see The Iceman Cometh a few years ago, and Kevin BLEW US AWAY! The power in his performance could be felt everywhere in the theater. We still talk about that play today, and I'm sure we all saw a piece of history. From Swimming With Sharks to American Beauty, he never ceases to impress me. The only negative thing about this man are his latest role choices, (K-PAX, Shipping News, David Gale)... but I'm sure he'll return soon with a knockout.
