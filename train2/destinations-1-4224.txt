Hands down, without question, the worst city I have ever experienced in America. These might be the dumbest people I have ever met. Couldn't wait to leave. The people are rude, it's hot, and way too redneck-esque for anyone with a HS diploma or higher. (PS - my hate mail has been full of incomprehensible grammar. . .figures.)
