He is a great actor. He has fallen into the 'creppy guy' character rut. But he is perfect at that. I recently saw him in the 'Deer Hunter' and he played a somewhat normal character for the majority of the movie, so I know he has that in him. One of my favorite scenes of all time form any movie was betweeb he and Dennis Hopper in 'True Romance'. The first time that I saw him in a film was when he played Sean Penn's father in 'At Close Range'. That was a really intense movie and both of those actors did a terrific job in it. He seems ot pop up in a lot of random roles (Pulp Fiction). I am pretty sure that he is one of my favorite 'Saturday Night Live' hosts ever. He has a really quirky sense of humor and has the ability ot comedically stare into the camera a la Norman Fell playing Mr.Roper in 'Three's Company'.
