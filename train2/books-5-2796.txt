When I was growing up, my parents had this book, and I distinctly remember staring at the black and white swastika on the spine. As a young kid, I didn't understand what the symbol represented, but I knew enough to get a vague sense of menace and dread whenever the swastika caught my eye. Strange that over 20 years later the book would still be the definitive history of Nazi Germany and that I would be drawn to read it. I think in most cases when you gain knowledge about something that is mysteriously sinister and mostly unknown, the knowledge makes you feel better about it. Just the opposite occurred when I read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. It increased my sense of dread. The fact that Nazi Germany could rise up in a supposedly civilized nation one of the most powerful on earth in the middle of the 20th century is appalling. And, as great a job as the book does of explaining the origins of the Third Reich, the core of the nightmare is still beyond explanation. That being said, if you're interested in understanding Germany, WW2, or the Holocaust, this book is a must-read. It's over 1,000 pages, so be prepared to dig in for a while. Shirer, who lived in Germany during the Nazi party's rise to power, does an excellent job of weaving his own first-hand experiences into the higher-level history, which gives the book a personal touch. Shirer's account is also based on an unprecedented amount of first-hand material, since huge sections of the German archives were captured by the Allies. This book can't explain how an entire country could fall under the spell of a madman like Hitler, but The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich does an excellent job of presenting the shocking facts.
