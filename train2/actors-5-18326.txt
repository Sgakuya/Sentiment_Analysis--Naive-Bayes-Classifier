A great director. He knew how to do a suspense movie.and he did not have to go for the blood and gore either. Rear Window, Psycho, North by Northwest.all classics. He had a way of keeping the audience drawn into his movies,You could not always predict what would happen in his movies, like the shower scene in Psycho.or the end of Psycho. for example.{if someone has never seen Psycho I would not want to give any spoilers} I would say he was one of the best directors around.
