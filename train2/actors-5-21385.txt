Fran is a very nice and kind person--down to earth and very intelligent. She doesn't act like a star and doesn't take herself too seriously. She's had to overcome obstacles in her life but doesn't feel sorry for herself. I'm not a big fan of her voice or laugh, but I like everything else about her. She is also an extremely beautiful woman--gorgeous. When I saw her in _Jack_, I was amazed by her extraordinary beauty.
