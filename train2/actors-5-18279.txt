Truly masterful director who chalked up several top knotch classics. Of course, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, 2001 and The Shining are the most notable of the lot, but Killer's Kiss was a very good low-budget film, The Killing was most entertaining and diverting, Paths of Glory was one the best anti-war flicks ever, Spartacus was among the best swords and sandals efforts, his version of Lolita was absolutely hysterical (this guy aways got great performances out of the truly magnificent Peter Sellers), and if your son is thinking about enlisting, just rent him Full Metal Jacket at the video store and I'll bet he'll want to go off to college or trade school instead. Kubrick's one clunker, Eyes Wide Shut, was the product of a director who was in his early 70s already and pretty much used up. On the whole, a pretty decent track record. Sure beats anyone out there today.
