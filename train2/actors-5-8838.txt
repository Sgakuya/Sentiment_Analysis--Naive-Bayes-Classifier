I think Sandra Bullock is a really good actress, I have always liked her movies. If I know shes in it I know the movie will be good. She is multi talented, I like her drama and comedy movies, for example: The Net and Ms Congieniality, The Net was Drama/suspence and Ms Congieniality was more comedy. I also liked the movie "While you were sleeping", which is a romantic comedy. Speed was a good movie too, however the two movies she made this year that I seen I didn't like. I didn't like Ms Congieniality 2 and Crash...She has made so many other movies too, as far back as I can remember she's been acting.
