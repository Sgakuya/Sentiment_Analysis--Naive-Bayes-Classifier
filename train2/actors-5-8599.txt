Perhaps the most captivating woman in film history, Gene Tierney may have been a bit crazy, but she was extremely talented and stunningly beautiful. I was completely captured from the very fist time I saw her in Leave Her To Heaven. So captured, in fact, that my first book(Holy Bull: hymns from an Ambien Summer) contained a poem(a dream in black white) based on her character in that movie. I didn't realize until a year or so later that the movie was in technicolor; the motel TV was a black white. She also shines in the noir/mystery classic LAURA. You might also have seen her in The Razor's Edge. She was acting all through the 40's, 50's 60's. Gene Tierney was an incredibly gifted and interesting woman. Go rent or buy(it's that good!) Leave Her To Heaven and I think you'll come to the same conclusion I have about this raven-haired beauty.
