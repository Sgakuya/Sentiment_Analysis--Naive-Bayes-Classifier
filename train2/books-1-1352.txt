This is a complete travesity! RAISING DUNCAN should never be this high on this list! Higher rated than PEANUTS? FOXTROT?? BOOM COUNTY??? PLEASE!!!! This strip is so plain, pedestrian and homogenous that it really could have been released in the 1950's. Ask yourself this...if Chris Browne weren't the son of the late great Dik Browne, would this comic really have been syndicated?
