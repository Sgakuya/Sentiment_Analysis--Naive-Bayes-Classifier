If you are smart, you will not attend this school. The instructors just lecture about their jobs all night. 2)The tuition is so high that it is ridiculous. 3) When you call the campus to speak with the financial aid advisors or student advisors, you get the voicemail telling you they will contact you in 24 hours. I have yet to be contacted. Oh lets not talk about getting your disbursments. The date always gets pushed back and noone from campus or the financial aid center for UOP knows anything, can't explain anything, refuse to tell you anything but the same thing over and over again. When I first enrolled, the recruiter lied like a dog. Promised me all this stuff like she was a army recruiter. You know how they (recruiters)lie. To this day, I get 5000 for stafford and 2500+ for pell. They bull me everytime with my disbursments. I hate that I ever started this school. I am currently researching for another university or college to attend online that is accredited by everyone and all schools will accept its credits. That is the plan for me. Not everyone has these same problems I know this. So I don't expect everyone to agree. I'm just giving you one persons experience, MINE. To everyone out there, please research your options good. Don't take my word, just please do the work on finding a quality education. judylicius
