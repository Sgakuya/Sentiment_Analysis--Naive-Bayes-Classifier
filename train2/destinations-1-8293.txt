My trip to Disneyland this week can only be described as a nightmare. Upon arrival, my family and I faced such incredible crowds we thought seriously about leaving (and we would have left if we had not had two young children with us). We stood in two separate lines in the hot sun for one hour just to ENTER the park, and things did not improve once inside. The streets and sidewalks were absolutely packed with people, which made it difficult to navigate (don't even think about using a stroller). Waits for the rides ranged from 45 to 90 minutes. The worst part was when we stood in line for nearly 30 minutes and then realized that we were in the wrong line (some of the car rides are not clearly marked). We simply gave up after that. At one point, I thought to myself that this is what hell must be like. I only wish someone had warned us before we wasted an entire day at this miserable place.
