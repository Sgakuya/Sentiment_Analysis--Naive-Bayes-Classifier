Tom Hanks...he's indescribable. He's so good, I can't put it into words. Since I was little I've watched his talent grow over the years. He's an excelent performer. I don't think there has been any movie he's acted in that I've seen I wouldn't give a five. He's another one of those actors that can transform a lifeless character into an extremely interesting one. Chooses good scpritps, too. Green Mile -one of the best!
