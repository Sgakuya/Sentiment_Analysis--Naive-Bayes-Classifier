The most expensive vehicle I ever owned. The resale value of them are lowest of all vans because Ford does not stand behind it products especially the faulty 3.8 head gasket design. After dealing with ford I will never own another ford. Would not still have the one I got but can't trade or sell it for nothing like what a compariable van should be worth.
