A terrific comic during the 1980's, but it has kind of outlived that time. Outland and Opus don't have quite the same feel. This strip wasn't afraid to make fun of Reagan, Gary Hart, Oliver North and other characters of the time, and did so in such a direct and funny way that you couldn't help but laugh. And, just when the political stuff got overwhelming, there'd be a series of strips that were just funny for the sake of being funny. Very creative.
