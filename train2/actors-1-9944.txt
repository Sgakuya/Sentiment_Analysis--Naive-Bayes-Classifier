I'll never understand why so many people are Bette Midler fanatics. I find her irritating, unattractive, and devoid of talent. The only good thing about Bette Midler's acting career is her appearance on Seinfeld, and the only reason that stands out is because of Kramer's girlish shriek when he thought he might meet her.
