What can anyone say about the great Ellen Burstyn? Oscar winner for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore , the mother in The Exorcist and currently running away with the TV series That's Life but also gives the performance of her career in Requiem For A Dream (Only Julia Roberts is keeping her from her second Oscar. Most of all, she is a survivor. In a business that discards its actresses when they hit a certain age, Ms. Burstyn hung in there. Bravo!
