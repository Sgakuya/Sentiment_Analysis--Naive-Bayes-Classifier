I really liked some of the movies she was in. I think that Girl Interuppted would have been better with someone else palying her part. I honestly don't think that she is that talented at all. I believe the only reason that she's even a star is because of her dear old daddy and her super model mom. And I really don't think she's good looking. I agree, what's up with those lips?? and why is she so out of proportion? ewww..
