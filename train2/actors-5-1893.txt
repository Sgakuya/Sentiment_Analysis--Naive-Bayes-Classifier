Oh my god don't get me started on how much I love this guy! He really is the best ever actor. Even his earlier works were great and no one can fault his great performance in Edward Scissorhands. He was SO sweet! And Chocolat which is my favourite film, he looks so dreamy in and he looks hot in From Hell too. Pirates of the Caribbean was a truly great acting performance by him and showed evryone how great an actor he is. Shame he didn't win the award because he really deserved it!
