Ted king as an actor sucks. First off I am not a Sonny& Carly fan I am a fan of GH and the truth is that Tk is a one dimensional actor. I think that he needs to bone up on his craft because whatever the heck he is trying to convey with his really bad Portrayal of Lorenzo is not working for me. Just because Ted King is handsome doesn't mean he can act. there are all sorts of very good looking out of work actors and Ted king should be one of them. If you don't like it too bad!
