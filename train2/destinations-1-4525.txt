I have lived here for a year and I hate it like no other. The scenery is ugly, it's full of Jesusfreaks and rednecks with 'Savage for President' bumper stickers, and NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO DRIVE PROPERLY! Plus, about the stereotype of the people here not doing anything except shopping, it's true. Even on weekdays the malls are packed and it once took me 45 minutes to find a parking spot. The people are faker than anybody you'd meet in Hollywood. The weather is too extreme as well. You feel like you're in an oven during the day and you're freezing your ass off at night. Stay away, it's basically a piss poor imitation of a generic Southern California city.
