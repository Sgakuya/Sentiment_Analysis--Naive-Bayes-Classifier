This vote is not even based upon his looks, my inclinations are not in that field, this is based in the fantastic talent this man has, even in moments such as his appearence in true Romance, Bradd draws out this totally beleivable character who you actualy get. What else can I say? Fight Club - mindblowing, Meet Joe Black - subtely perfect, there is no point in continuing. I just wish he wasn't so attractive so i can say how good he is without accussations flying!
