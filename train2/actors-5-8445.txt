Olivia de Havilland has given many great performances and deserves her place among the top five greatest actresses. She fully deserved her two Oscars and should have won a third for THE SNAKE PIT ('48). Even her leading lady roles opposite Errol Flynn in classic adventure-romance films that are much admired today, showed that there much was much more to her than just a pretty face. Her major roles usually required her to play down her natural beauty but she was anything but plain (as someone else commented). For proof, take a look at her Lady Marian in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD or her Arabella Bishop in CAPTAIN BLOOD--or later on, MY COUSIN RACHEL. She was a great beauty as well as a fine actress in a variety of roles. If you want to see her in a great comedy role watch STRAWBERRY BLONDE with Cagney and Hayworth.
