It's hard not to be in love with Liv Tyler. One look at that Aerosmith video (was it 'Crazy'?) a few years ago and I was hooked. And it turns out she can actually act! It can't be much longer before she gets a break-out role that will push her into that small group of women that can carry movies by themselves.
