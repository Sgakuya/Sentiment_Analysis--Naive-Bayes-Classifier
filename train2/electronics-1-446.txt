I bought one. I t was addictive tes . But thr RF IN is made very cheaply. Don't try moving it around too much because your RF in will snap off the module. But that's not the bad news... It costs more to fix it than what you paid for the item (and that's with the warranty)!!!! I guess I won't be watching my favorites shows when I want. It's not cost effective to repair...
