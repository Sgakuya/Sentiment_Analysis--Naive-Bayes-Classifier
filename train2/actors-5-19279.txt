Tom just keeps getting better with age. Confident intelligent with those looks, who could want more? From Chaz posters to Young Restless to Magnum PI to his Westerns other movies on to his stand on gun control. Is there a possibility Tom will take Charleton Heston's place with the NRA? Would like to see it happen!! He's a class act all the way!
