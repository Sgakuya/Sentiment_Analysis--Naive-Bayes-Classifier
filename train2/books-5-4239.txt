The first time I read this book I was 15 years old, and I remember liking it - primarily because there was a lot of cursing. The second time I read this book I was 25, and it hit me like a ton of bricks. All of a sudden I got everything that Salinger was trying to say - about the loneliness, anger, disillusionment, of being misunderstood. The power of this book lies in its timelessness - Salinger is able to tap into emotions that almost every young person has felt, and express them in a language that is personal and touching. Now, I make it a point to read Catcher in the Rye every couple of years, and it is firmly entrenched as one of my top 5 books of all time.
