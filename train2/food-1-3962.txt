It seems everytime I purchase a Bag of Ruffle Potato Chips, they're small pieces and most of them are crushed. When I pay the price of $2.99 a bag, I would think I would be able to eat them one at a time instead of a handful of crumbs at a time. I am not pleased at all. I think it is a waste of money to buy this brand when in the past they used to be my favorite brand. Deb Putman 1487 Hapsburg Ave. Holt, MI 48842
