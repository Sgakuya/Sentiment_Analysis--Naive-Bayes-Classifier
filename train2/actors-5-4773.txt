Hugh Jackman has so far proven to be a consistent actor when you look at the range he has. He has charm, wit, toughness, sincerity and I'll go as far to say that he is handsome (I'm not into guys). He pulled off having a canadian-english accent as Wolverine in X-Men, and american-english accent in Swordfish, and a british-english accent in Kate and Leappold and he's Australian. He had the toughness and charm to make Wolverine his own character in the X-Men films, He showed a gentalmanly side of himself in Kate and Leappold, and carried a lot of the action flick as a hacker in Swordfish. He has proven he's not a 1-dimensio actor on on top of that he's acted on stage and can sing. He can attract an audience because he's tough enough, for the guys and his looks and charms draw the ladies.
