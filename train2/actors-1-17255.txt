this is a personal note about beth ehlers. I do not know how to contact her personally and I only hiope she reads this. I read an article in one of the soap opera mags that features an actor on the last page and what they like and so forth. the question was. "what is your greatest love". her answer was that she could not decide between her books or her children. how sad is that for her kids to read. what about her husband. does he not count either. I cant look at her in the same way. anna greeley
