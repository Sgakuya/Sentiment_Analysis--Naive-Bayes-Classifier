These guys are among the handful of filmmakers currently active who can be considered great. From Blood Simple, a splendid neo-noir, to the hysterical Raising Arizona, to the spirited, arch Fargo, to the overlooked masterpiece Barton Fink, they have consistently made the most daring, well-conceived and executed American films over the past 20 years. Even Hudsucker, O Brother, and Lebowski, which weren't quite as good, are still lightyears more mature, impactful and creative than any of the crap churned out by charlatans like Spielberg and Lucas. The scripts are uniformly brilliant, the visuals quite compelling, and performances first rate. This is the Real Deal.
