Damp. Rainy. Overcrowded. Too stratified for my taste. Cockney accent difficult to understand, duckie. Obsessive about gardens, tea, and maintaining proper decorum. They drive funny. (Use the RIGHT side of the road, people!) English cuisine is an oxymoron. They BOIL near everything. Can't get near Stonehenge anymore. Monarchy outlived its usefulness two or three centuries ago. Don't hear about them much at the Olympics, Daley Thompson notwithstanding. They don't like Argentines, the French, the Irish, the Scots, or the Welsh much. They are a foppish little piece of real estate with grandiose designs on cornering the market on the euro.
