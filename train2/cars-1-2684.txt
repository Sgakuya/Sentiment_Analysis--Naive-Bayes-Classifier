It's a Ford. The Vette, The Viper, they are all fast cars, plenty fast enough for the streets, Does not matter which is faster, because they are all real close. If you really have to out do the next guy a few simple mods will put you ahead. It is a shame you People compare a Mustang to a Vette, a Vette has so much more style and class it isn't even to be compared.
