I find Kate Winslet to be one of the most talented and beautiful women in the movies. From her early career in Heavenly Creatures (what a presence!) to her sublime portrayal of Marianne in Sense and Sensibility, she has stunned me at every turn. I think that Kate is one of the most underrated actors working today. Perhaps the fact that she is underexposed works for all of us, keeps us patiently waiting for her next film so that we can add it to our collections as well. What a delight she is to watch.
