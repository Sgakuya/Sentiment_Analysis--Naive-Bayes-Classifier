Frankly, I could care less about Sean Penn's political rantings and ravings (which is totally irrelevant). And I personally don't give a damn about Penn as a human being. What is strictly relevant here, however, is Penn's immense acting ability. As an actor, he deserves to be mentioned amongst today's very best. A rare acting talent with an eye for breakthrough roles, Penn is quickly becoming one of the great modern actors of his era. Moreover, he takes chances of which few others would. For this, Penn ought to be commended.
