Silence of the Lambs is one of my favorite books and favorite movies of all times. Oh how I waited in anticipation for this sequel. I have never been so disappointed. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It's like Hannibal and Silence were written by two completely different authors. Why did he treat these great charactors like Clarice and Hannibal so poorly in this horrible book? The possibilities were so promising. Maybe the movie will be better. Good luck Julianne.
