I'd like to see him get away from directing the current glamour boy of the week. At least for a couple of films. No disrespect to Kevin Costner, Charlie Sheen,Tom Cruise, et al. I'd like to see him direct something different; for him. But I loved the performances he got from Willem Dafoe,(Platoon), and James Woods, (Salvador), who are not hunks. And Tom Berenger, who is, and was. I'm hoping he rebounds, big time, from the disastrous Alexander! I love his writing, as well!
