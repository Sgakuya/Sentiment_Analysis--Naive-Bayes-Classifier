Now while I love Jennifer, I'm not saying she's the most talented actress out there. She is, however, very smart, energetic and lends this great vibe to her roles. On Friends, she is unforgettable. Let's face it...everything Rachel did became a phenomena. Like The Rachel haircut? She is often typecasted into similar movie roles, characters like Rachel. I'd like to see her branch out more and really spread her acting wings. More hits like Bruce Almighty, perhaps.
