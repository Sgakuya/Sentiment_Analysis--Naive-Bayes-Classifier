WATCHERS is one of the best (of literally hundreds and hundreds) books I've ever read. I don't want to give anything away, but you get so absorbed in the characters and plot that the ending is...both unforseeable and remarkable. You'll never forget it. I have recommended WATCHERS to everyone I know, and they loved it too, even if it's not the kind of book they usually read. WATCHERS what started me on Dean Koontz books, and I still consider it his best, at least as far as the impact it had on me.
