Lived there, but thank god we left. Yes New Jersey has its nice parts, but the worst parts are the absolutely worst. The NJ Turnpike is the worst, and why after all these years does it still stink like rotten eggs on the turnpike in northern New Jersey. Polluted, overpriced, overcrowded, I have absolutely no desire to ever live there again.
