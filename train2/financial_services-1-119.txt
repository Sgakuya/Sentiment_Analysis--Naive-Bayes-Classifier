The fee structure and service that this bank offers are both terrible. There seems to be an institutional arrogance that permeates all transactions (except an occasional nice teller). People who don't know what they're doing give information that contradicts information given by another employee. I've heard their employee turnover is high; it must not be a very satisfactory place to work. To those employees who are happy to work for Wells Fargo, where are you that you are proud and satisfied? Apparently it's not at any of the branches I've dealt with!
