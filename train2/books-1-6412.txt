Had it been in the Fantasy section, I would have given it a four. Viewed as non-fiction - no way! It's a good read if you like new age-style fiction/fantasy. The pleasure of reading it quite dissapeared, though, when the last page turned out to be a money-trolling ad which *was not even consistent with what was said in the book*!!!
