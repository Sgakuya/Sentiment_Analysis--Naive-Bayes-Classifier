I met Mr. Wayne while scuba diving (me...not him). He was in poor health and didn't look great...BUT, he was congenial, kind and accomodating. Even though he was on the verge of death, he took time to be good to his fans. He was a big MAN. No, he wasn't a great actor. Yes, he did inspire America and Americans. When people ask me, Why did you join the Marine Corps? . I always say the same thing, I wanted to serve, so I picked the best branch....and I wanted to be like John Wayne -- American!
