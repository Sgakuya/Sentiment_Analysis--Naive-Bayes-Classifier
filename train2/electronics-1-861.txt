It isn't really fair to rate the entire 6100 series all together. I see that not only Sprint PCS, but also Verizon wireless has dropped the 6100 from its line. The problem is this: Nokia uses their own CDMA chip because they are too snobbish (or cheap) to license the Qualcomm chip. Therefore, the 6185 (Sprint PCS) which I have, absolutely sucks. As for the TDMA (AT T phone), that is good from what I hear...
