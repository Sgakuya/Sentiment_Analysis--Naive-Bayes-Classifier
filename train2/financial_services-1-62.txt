I believe that US Bank severely abuses customers. On May 31, 2002, a US Bank branch in Nashville, Tennessee issued a $61,000 check from our US Bank account to a non-owner and unauthorized party. After reporting the unauthorized withdrawal to US Bank, US Bank responded by refusing service. When we attempted to hold US Bank accountable, US Bank then lied to the OCC, filed false statements in court and denied that we were customers. During court proceedings, US Bank refused and/or failed to produce our banking records from the account. After two and a half years of denials and false statements, US Bank finally admitted negligence. Our deposits were not safe in US Bank. I no longer believe that any customer's money is safe in US Bank. Since it happened to us, it could happen to anyone.
