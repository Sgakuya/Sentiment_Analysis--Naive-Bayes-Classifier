Telus is terrible!!! Their service doesnt work around my house and when i tell them that, they just say that im under contract and if i want to cancel, i have to pay $400. Rogers has a cap of $200 for cencellation penalties but obviously Telus doesnt because they lose so many customers that they need that extra money!! NEVER BUY TELUS!!!!!
