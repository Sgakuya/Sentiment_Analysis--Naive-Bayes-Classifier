This is my favorite American actor. I identified with his characters, he played them so well. He was clumsy, he stuttered, but he meant good, and eventually he got there. That's basically the story of a whole lot of his films, and that's what I love about his work. Mr Smith goes to Washington, Liberty Valance, The flight of the Phoenix: from the 30's to the 60's Stewart played men that were no heroes, but still did heroic things because they felt the moral obligation to do so. James Stewart played human's and he was an expert at it.
