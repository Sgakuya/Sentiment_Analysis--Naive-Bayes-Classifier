She’s either an awesome actress or I’m a little infatuated, most likely both. I was watching a football game when on came a little promo for CBS’s new show, Cold Case. My initial reaction was – Wow! Who’s she? Needless to say I just had to tune in. I came to realize I had seen her before in an episode or two of Xena and was just as mesmerized then. Kathryn is now one of my favorite actresses, I watch Cold Case every week that I can and she has the prettiest smile in Hollywood.
