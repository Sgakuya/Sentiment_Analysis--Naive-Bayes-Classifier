Dustin Hoffman is an incredibly talented actor. The Graduate and Kramer vs. Kramer proved him as a force to be reckoned with. His performance in Tootsie was nothing less than inspired. He outdid himself, though, in the classic Rain Man. I don't think anyone else could have played that part with such sensitivity and passion. He certainly deserves the Oscar awards that undoubtedly adorn his mantle.
