Recently met a man from outside of Memphis- very wealthy-but still ignorant- the amount of black/white polarization is incredible in this state (as I suspect it is in most of the south). My impressions seem to solidify my impressions that the USA is a still a racially divided nation, especially in the south-and areas of the great plains and rocky mountain regions. In addition we now have rampant homophobia and 'ethnic judging' based on religion and ethnicity. The country is even more divided then 150 years ago IMO- the bigotry and ignorance of many in the south foster this. From what I have seen there is trash everywhere- the main interstates are in disrepair- lots of uninformed people (trying to be charitable) bad personal habits (smokers abound) bad dietary habits (lots of out of shape people) Good deal of intolerance toward minorities- too many cars propped up on concrete blocks-that seem to be in some sort of repair....bad envirionment, poor schools, poor local services, Cheap costs- but you pay for quality- and this state has few redeeming qualities. Lots of bad places to eat- waffle and pancake houses, crappy chain eateries. The few plus items include- good barbeque and country music- but the negatives are many and overwelming.
