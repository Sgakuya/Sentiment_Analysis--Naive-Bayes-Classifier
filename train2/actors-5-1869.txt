It's a bit freaky to say that i fancy a guy old enough to be my dad, but he is so brilliant i have loved him ever since i saw edward sissorhands. I'm so glad he became famous and we got to be introduced to this now world famous gorgeous man, who can play a drunk (well it seems to me drunk) pirate!!! Yay for Johnny!
