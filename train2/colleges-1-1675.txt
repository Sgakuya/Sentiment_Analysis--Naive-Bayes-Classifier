A non-Diverse, EASY, football factory with NOT enough majors, curriculum course choices and located in one of the 2 armpits of the nation ; the crime ridden slums of South Bend. I know from direct first hand experience from those who attended that no one studies there or is actually required to exhibit scholarship/do homework. Faculty is lacking and value of ND degree is not at all helpful after graduation. No culture.
