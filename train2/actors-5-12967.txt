She's beautiful and sexy in a smoky kinda way, a bit like a younger English Lauren Bacall. She definitely brings much needed class and sophistication to cinema and is often the highlight in what I think of as overrated and dull arty films like The English Patient and Gosford Park. She was lovely in Four Weddings and frankly if I had written the script I would've had Hugh Grant's character get off with her when her character confesses about always having loved him.
