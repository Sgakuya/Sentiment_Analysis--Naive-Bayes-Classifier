I use to live in Los Angeles, and at first, I thought it was an okay city. But as time went on, I realized how dirty the city and the people are. The locals are fake, shallow and materialistic. You always seem to be getting the run-arounds and getting ripped off. There's also traffic traffic traffic....basically life in LA is waiting waiting waiting. The Orange County area is a lot better place to visit and live. All in all, LA lacks substance and culture. If you want to brush up on your Spanish..then come here....cuz tons of Mexicans reside here.
