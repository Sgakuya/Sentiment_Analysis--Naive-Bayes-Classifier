IMO she's the most gorgeous woman ever to have graced the cinema. Unlike most Hollywood celebs she doesn't need endless self-publicising, air-brushing and face-lifts. Yes I have seen her in the flesh and she's 100% real..no plastic. As an actress she's very versatile and still looks how whether she's got a brown perm (Married to the mob), a brown bob (Scarface) or long tresses (Dangerous liaisons). Even in her mid-40s she's got more sex appeal than Scarlett Johansson and all the other current flavours of the month put together.
