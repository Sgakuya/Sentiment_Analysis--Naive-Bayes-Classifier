She is absolutely sensational in Monster and will probably win an Oscar for that role. She credits a woman director for being able to see beyond her sensational beauty to the talent underneath that enabled her to turn in this great performance. She is very beautiful without a ton of makeup and it'sice that she is secure enough with herself to not go the implant route. I think she is one of the best actors in Hollywood. Also, she was smart enough to lose her South African accent and work with a dialogue coach to sound American, thus broadening her chances for interesting roles.
