I have at t wireless and have had problems with my sony ericsson phone. They have changed their warranty service on the telephone and I have been advised to buy a new telephone to resolve the issue of a broken motherboard, or send my phone to sony to fix which will take ten days or pay at t $50 to replace my phone. The phone is only six months old, I paid $200 for it and at the time was guaranteed a one year warranty. At t has not helped me in any way and their customer service has been abhorrent. I would not recommend this wireless service to anyone.
