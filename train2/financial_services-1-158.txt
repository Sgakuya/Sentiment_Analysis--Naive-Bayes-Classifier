Citizen's bank are a bunch of SCAM ARTISTS. Withhold $1 and $2 charges so they can put them through when there is no money in your account and then charge you hundreds of fees in overcharges!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They have STOLE over $500 from us, some of wich were not legitimate withdrawals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
