I love watching Gene Kelly dance. He was great in Singin' in the Rain, and An American in Paris. I loved the scene in Anchors Awheigh when he danced with Jerry the mouse.He had a wonderful imagination for dance routines. Tap dancing on roller skates, or on the rooftops. His dance routines with Cyd Charrise and Leslie Caron, etc. I have two left feet myself so it is a treat to watch some of these talented dancers.
