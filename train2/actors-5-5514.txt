I was not a fan during the Marky Mark days but boy have I become one now!!! What a gorgeous great actor he is. I have been very impressed. Can't wait to see him in Rock Star, Planet of the Apes Something about Charlie. I think he has a huge career ahead of him. I also have tremendous respect for someone who can turn their life around the way he has.
