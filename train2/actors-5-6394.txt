A truly talented guy, he has managed to stay under the radar for a long time, choosing unique roles. He has a keen sense of emotion and a depth that's refreshing. He also has a quirky humor that's hilarious. his breakthrough role was truly in Saving Private Ryan where he shares the story of his mother, reflecting the hearts of all the men in the story. He is absolutely great and I hope to see him in bigger and more lauded roles soon.
