Hes such a talanted blessed actor.I just saw sixth sense last night and I couldnt believe it.I just wanted to squeeze him,and tell him everything would be allright,like as if it was real.LOL. As if what was happening to him was happening to me.ADORABLE is another word.Ofcourse I dont know him, but I can just tell hes probally a very friendly sweet and funny guy. Was it really just an act or is he like that in real life?
