I reside in a rural area of NC at the moment. Several months ago, I purchased my first cellular phone from Alltel. The Alltel Sales Rep explained the features of several phones and how Digital connections were up and coming in this area within the next month or two. I chose a phone that is supposedly programed for all the new tower signals of not just Alltel but other companies as well ( this as yet remain to be seen ). I had heard many horror stories about cellular phone bills so I was very cautious to watch my minutes. As time went by I was a little more relaxed and was using my phone more and more or atleast tried to. I noticed quite often when I was inside buildings I recieved no signal. I refuse to lose faith...I'll just hang in there and and gut it out ( really what choice do I have? I'm in a contract ) What really burns my coat tails is in these same buildings and other general outside areas which I recieve no signal I see other people on their cell phones. What is the point of having the latest cell phone with no signal? I am emabrassed to say I own an Alltel phone.
