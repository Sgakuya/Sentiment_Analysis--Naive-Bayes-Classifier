A fun read to entertain you until the next book comes out. An interesting reference to the Harry Potter series and Rowling adds special touches (doodling on the pages by Harry, Ron and Hermione). Gives the feel that you are borrowing Harry's own text book. Definitely a fun read if you are a Harry Potter fan.
