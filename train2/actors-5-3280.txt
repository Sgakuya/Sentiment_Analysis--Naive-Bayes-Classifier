This guy had a pretty good resurgence in the 90s. He was awesome in Cobb ! That was an Oscar winning performance but hey, at least he got one, even though it was for supporting actor, what's up with that. He has a leading man's acting ability. Still, what's up with those Men In Black movies? Has his career gone stagnant again like it did in the late 80s
