Wachovia -- Disguised as First Union -- is comprised of nothing more than white collar criminals. They have ciphend more than $500 from my business account in the last three weeks! They now have what they call an Unavailable Funds Fee in which none of the hot shots that I spoke with can explain because it's borderline criminal. They insist that they post deposits first but my statements suggest otherwise. They have used the Patriot Act -- signed into law by President George Bush shortly after 9/11 -- to maximize the amount of funds they can legally and apethically steal from their customers' accounts. I am a small business owner that works extremely hard to earn an honest and decent living. It is totally disheartening to wake up the next morning only to realize that your hard-earned dollars have been stolen while you were asleep.
