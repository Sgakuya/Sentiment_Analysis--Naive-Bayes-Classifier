I've always smoked Marlboro Reds. For the past two days, I've been using Lights. They are leaving a very bad taste in my mouth. I must smell horrible and won't get too close to anyone. The Ultras do the same thing. As for a nicotine lift, I'm not getting it, but it's really not bothering me. The Reds made me cough alot after almost each puff. The Lights are not doing that, and I'm getting a good puff from them too. From the comments I've seen, I think I'll try the Kamel Red Lights.
