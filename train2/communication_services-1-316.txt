Ok let me say something about this service: Its a rip off. This is good if you want a Nextel phone but they wont take you because you have no credit or you want lots of stupid extra features like ringtones and wallpapers and games. Besides that its a total ripoff its $1.50 a day (unlimited use) for the walkie talkie. So that means if you buy $30 of pre-paid talk time you only get 20 days of the 2-way not to mention the 10 cents a mintue you pay for normal celluar calls outgoing and incomming. I ended up paying almost 90 dollars a month for this stupid service and the worst part is if you decide to buy 50 dollars worth they dont give you extra minutes its always the same conversion rate. Also their phones (overpriced yet cool) dont work with Nextel's service so if you someday established credit and wanted service with Nextel (which I think offers great deals) your phone is junk. AVIOD AT ALL COSTS or it will cost you.
