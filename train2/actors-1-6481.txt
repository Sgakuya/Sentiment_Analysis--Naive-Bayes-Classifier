What a bum. We invited him as a tribute/award recipient at a pretty renowned film festival (11 yrs old now). He agreed and was honored to come. The DAY he was supposed come and speak in a hotel ballroom; in front of 700 ticket buying film fans... he canceled, with no excuse, other than to say he was humiliated. He should be! Wazzup, too many beers Bobby!? You woke up late???
