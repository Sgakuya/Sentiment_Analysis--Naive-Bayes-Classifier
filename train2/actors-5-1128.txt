Tom Hanks Movies: The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Splash, Big, That Thing You Do!, Philadelphia, Apollo 13, The 'Burbs, Turner Hooch.....and the list goes on. And most of them I can say are some of my favorite movies. The Green Mile was so.....so amazing. I can hardley put it into words. For a movie that takes place mostly in one building for over three hours, it was unbelieveable. I wanted to see more. The cast was so good at playing their parts that I could only know them all as their character. Forrest Gump was another great movie. I love the innocence of Tom Hanks' Forrest. I couldn't picture any other actor in Forrest's shoes. He was remarkable! Tom Hanks is the only actor I know that can take any character and make himself that guy. He is his character. And now he's doing Band of Brothers, which is amazing. Tom Hanks is a jack of all trades.
