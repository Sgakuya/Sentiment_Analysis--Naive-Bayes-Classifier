I agree Agatha Christie is SOOOO boring... i tried to go through this book as much as i could, but ended up with a headache and got soooooooo bored after like the 2nd part. i hated it. don't say that its cuz i never read the whole thing, but books arnt good if it doesn't even capture the readers intrest at all in the beggining or througout the whole thing.
