She's always been my favorite. I love watching all her movies, despite them being good or bad movies. Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Love her style and taste, and since she's a fellow Bay Area native, spikes my interest in her more. It's interesting to read about her and all that she has to say. I'll write more later when I feel like it...
