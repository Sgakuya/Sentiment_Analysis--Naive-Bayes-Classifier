What is it about Hugh that I find so fake? Maybe the fact that he never seems to change no matter what role it is that he is playing? That must be it! He sucks! Yes, that must be the reason! He is capable of looking comfortable in front of the camera and can come of as funny and snide but beyond that he really doesn't do much. The only explanation I can think why he is continually cast is his name value. But, that hasn't really been a great use to the last few films he has worked on. This guy just isn't a passable talent. He has not yet proven himself as an actor. He has proven that he exzists.
