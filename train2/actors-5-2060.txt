Anthony Hopkins is such a powerful, dynamic actor! He can be scary, sorrowful, funny -- anything. He was absolutely terrifying as Hannibal Lecter -- I don't think anyone can deny that. At the same time, though, you almost have to feel sorry for Hannibal. Hopkins portrays him with many facets. He's scary and clever but he's also lonely and an outcast. Anthony Hopkins is awesome.
