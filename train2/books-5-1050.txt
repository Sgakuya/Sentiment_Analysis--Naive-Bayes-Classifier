An excellent book that continues the story of Grandma Dowdel and her two grandkids from Chicago. Though it's aimed at a young audience, adults will have a great time reading this. But, I do recommend you start with the first book, A Long Way From Chicago before reading this one. You don't necessarily have to, but it will make for a better read if you do. My only complaint about the book is that it's only 130 pages long.
