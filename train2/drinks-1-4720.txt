I'd rather let the monkey from Outbreak spit in my mouth. Dr Pepper is the worst thing to come in a small can since Michael Jackson. It's like liquid holocaust. Drinking Dr Pepper makes you a terrible person, on a level plane with arsonists, child molesters and Ben Affleck. To Hell with Dr Pepper. He's not even a real doctor.
