A personal favorite. Not particularly handsome but one heck of an actor. While he was sensational in Casablanca, my favorite Bogey movie is The Caine Mutiny. Having read the book several times (its great), Borgart's portrayal of Captain Queeg is compelling and without flaw. I really can't name a Bogard movie where I wasn't impressed. Died too young.
