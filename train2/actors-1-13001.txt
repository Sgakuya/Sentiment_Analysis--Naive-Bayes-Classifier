Once was funny, but now just a total airhead. She really isn't that great of an actress. She is okay when she's in a spoof of some kind, but when it actually takes half a brain to act she horrific. I used to think she was exceptionally attractive but recently she just looks as if she doesn't care if she bathes. I don't think just because she works in Hollywood she should be expected to never age or have a bad day, but good personal hygeine should be at the top of everyone's list of priorities.
