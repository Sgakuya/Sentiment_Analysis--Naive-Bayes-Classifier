His is the consumate actor...manages to embody every character he plays...he plays the characters so well, you forget that he's not actually playing a role (unlike some of these so-called super stars!!!)...even if the movie or script is bad, his performance will always be the best thing about it. Hopefully, he will be successful enough to continue getting roles and working for as long as he wishes but still not be so popular that he can't do his own shopping.
