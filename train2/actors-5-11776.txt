Angelina Jolie is amazing. Actually, the only movies I have seen her in are Girl, Interrupted and Life or Something Like it but those were enough to realize how talented this woman is. She was flawless playing the role of Lisa in Girl, Interruped and definitely deserved the Oscar. She is much more talented than most actresses out there.
