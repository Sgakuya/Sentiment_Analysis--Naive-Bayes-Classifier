Another one of those life lessons about human nature King novels. The Long Walk is, obviously, a metaphor for life. Along with the actual plot of 100 teenage boys setting out on a death march, King has skillfully woven in a subplot of flashbacks, something not many authors can successfully do. Particularly disturbing was the final scene between Garraty and Stebbins, in which the nechanical rabbit finally wears out. If we can get all of the prim, proper censors past the graphic sexual nature of this (and all of stpehen King's novels), everyone should read this book.
