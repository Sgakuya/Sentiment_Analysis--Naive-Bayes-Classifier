Martha makes me want to puke! From her scraggly hair (that is always in her friggin' eyes) down to her fugly toes, I literally do not understand the hype about Martha! It's no secret that she has a notorious reputation for being unpredictably volatile and very difficult to work for because of her insane perfectionistic ways. I wonder if there could possibly be some bi-polar and OCD tendencies hiding behind that creepy smile? (not at all to make fun of mental illness--just Martha) She has made a fortune just off of her 'wanna-be's', the people who buy every book, tape every episode, and breathe every word she anunciates (with an obsessive-like perfection--just listen to her speak-you'll understand what I mean). So many of her followers are the 'creativity challenged' who don't give themselves enough credit where their own talents are concerned. Oh and it's such a shame, because Martha has made an INSANE fortune as a result.
