She impressed me before I actually went to a college where people like her from Manhattan were a dime a dozen. Put simply, she got into the film biz because of her connections, like many else said. She has no acting talent, she just is herself, which is a monied, well-mannered, quiet, prissy girl from Manhattan. I suppose Julia Stiles and Laura Linney fit into this category too, among others. These people are true circus acts, and anyone that hasn't met them in person will be in for an eye-opener. It's like going to the zoo. They are clowns that have lived in luxury for their entire life and have no idea what black people are like, or ordinary people, for that matter. I'm dead serious, it's a shame that there are people like this in America. While these people are very sympathetic, many of them, to the plight of blacks and the poor, that is more because it is romantic for them, not realistic. Overall, I feel Gwyneth Paltrow, like Nicole Kidman, fits her parts, but I don't feel she is a versatile actor or a very interesting one, for that matter. Her worst parts are the ones that require her to be poor or just an average girl, you can see her struggle.
