I have been a Pac Bell customer for almost two years now. I am very glad that my contract is almost up. The times I have truly needed my cell phone, I am unable to get service. I was in Las Vegas last October for a family wedding. Most of us had cell phones and we used them to contact each other. I of course could not get a signal anywhere. Another time I was meeting an old friend in Los Angeles. I told him to call me on my cell phone when he got arrived. Needless to say, again there was no signal available - IN LOS ANGELES? Give me a break. I use the phone a lot when I travel. The roaming fees and long distance add up fast. I plan on switching to Verizon. Friends who use them have never had a problem.
