This is my second favourite King novel. I read the uncut version so it stretched to over 1,500 pages. I have no idea which bits were excluded in the original but none of it should have been because it was all necessary to the story. I absolutely adored the philosophical ramblings about how to rebuild the world and how not to make the same mistakes again. However, you could see that the human race is doomed to make the same mistakes over and over again. I loved and identified each character and because the book was so long you really got to know them. I was a little daunted when I first started to read it but there was not a point in the book where I wasn't completely into it.
