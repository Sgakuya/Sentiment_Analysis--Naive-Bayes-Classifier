Charles Bronson really does it for me, He said in an interview that he was just giving the people what they wanted, and I thought, that's all that matters to me. Some of my favorites are(not necessarily in order) Mr. Majestyk, C'era una volta il Wes, St Ives, From Noon Till Three, Passager de la pluie, Le, Hard Times,an episode of Twilight Zone he did called Two, and the list goes on and on.
