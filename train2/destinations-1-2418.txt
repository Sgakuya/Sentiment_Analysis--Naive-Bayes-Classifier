My husband and I visited Athens in 2001. We were completely disgusted at the filth, the broken sidewalks, horrible traffic, the rudest reception of Americans we have ever seen. Try hailing a taxi after shopping in Platka, FORGET it. If a kind Greek steps up to help you, you will still pay a very premium price for a ride from hell. Motorcycles and Mopeds drive between the cars and red lights basically mean nothing. And, please do not ask for ice tea, unless you are prepared for a long, ugly stare. They sure like to confuse Americans with regard to the dollar to drachma exchange. And, GRATUITY is outrageous, and for what? Service was hideous---everywhere. And, if you think of visiting the Parthenon on the Acropolis be prepared to side-step the dog/human feces on the sidewalks. This is one place we will never visit again. YUCK on a scale of 1-5 this trip rated a negative 5.
