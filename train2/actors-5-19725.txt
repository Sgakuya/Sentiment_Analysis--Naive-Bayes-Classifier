I just like David Schwimmer. I have seen him in other projects but to me he is Ross. In season seven he started to look so good again and I think he even highlighted his hair that made him look so good. I read he may be getting married this summer but that will probably be a very private wedding. Time will tell if the rumor is true. I hope he will sign for a season nine of Friends so we can have two more seasons. Ross has to be with Rachel!
