Deborah Kerr, extremely versatile actor, made over 45 films in addition to theatre and television performances. She has been in both dramatic and comedic films, DID sing lead ins to songs in The King and I and sang Whistle a Happy Tune and has done convincing accents ranging from American English, Irish, Scottish, Norwegian, various English accents and others. She was nominated for 6 Oscars and received a lifetime achievement Oscar in 1994. In Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (at the age of 21) she played three parts. She was brilliant in Black Narcissus as a mother superior and as a governess in The Innocents (still one of the best suspense/horror films of all times). She has played more different characters than just about any of her contemporaries in the 40's - 60's and did it all without overdone special effects, animation, sexual explicitness, profanity or stupid plots. Among her more memorable roles: a drunkard in Edward, My Son; a nun in Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison; an adultress in From Here to Eternity (cast against type); a spinster in Night of the Iguana; and a lonely, sexually repressed, mother dominated plain Jane in Separate Tables. In any of her films all you have to do is watch her eyes to feel the action. Those who underrate her fail to realize that her career covered more than just Hollywood and spanned over 50 years. She did not behave like a star but instead maintained a career of quietly doing the job she was hired to do. None of her costars ever said one negative word about her and all praised her ability and professionalism, her care and concern for her fellow actors and crew. While she certainly deserved an Oscar many times and especially for The Sundowners (1960), she still managed a gracious always the bridesmaid, never the bride reaction. A great lady (at 81 years of age), a beautiful woman and a superb actor.
