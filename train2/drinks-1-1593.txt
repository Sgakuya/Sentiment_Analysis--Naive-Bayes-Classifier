Really one of the worst American beers. I remember when you couldn't get it in the East back in the early 70s when it had a growing reputation and this rarity lent it a mystical cachet. Then it became available in the NE and people, long awaiting its arrival, gave it a try. And were disappointed. It has a rather small and odd flavor and no real heft. This is only suited to chug-a-lug freezing cold on 100 degree days after you mowed the lawn.
