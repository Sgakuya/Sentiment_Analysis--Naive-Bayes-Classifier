I have only recently discovered Wachovia's retroactive funds policy. They are very quick to retroactively REMOVE funds from my account (regardless of the actual posting date), but they NEVER retroactively deposit funds into my account (regardless of the actual deposit date). And their customer service? McDonalds has better customer service than Wachovia Bank.
