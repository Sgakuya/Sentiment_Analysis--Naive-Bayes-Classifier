I think Colin Farrell is a good actor, w/ room 2 grow, he is still young enough to improve his acting abilities. As for the way he looks, he just cant help it....He's Irish for goodness sake! The accent helps alot also, I mean realy, what woman can resist a man with an accent and great smile? (i.e. American Outlaw.....Great smile, how can you say no to that? :) Ofcourse....Thats just my opinion.....
