For those of you who think he plays the same role over and over again, go rent the Executioner's Song(he played Gary Gilmore, that's hardly a strong, silent-type cop role). He was also really good in Coal Miner's Daughter. The Executioner's Song is still my top Jones movie. Let him have some cheesy, easy roles these days. He paid his dues and has proven his talent. I wish I could recall the name of that TNT western where he was riding across the plains and some cowboy passing him, going the other way, asks him What are you doing out here in God's country? ...Tommy Lee's character replies Tryin' to get the hell across it before He sees me .
