I bought the Warner Brothers Chevy Venture edition(2000 used with 66,000 miles) and have had nothing but problems. The transmission went within the first 90 days (thankfully still covered under warranty). Also, sensor "idiot"lights (seat belt, check engine, etc.)continued to come off and on, and after several different mechanic and garage inspections, we were told that the computer chips were causing this, and we should just ignore it. Now, there is a crack in the manifold and the engine is shot. I understood from the mechanic that this is a common problem with this car. Recall? Class Action Law Suit? In any case, under no circumstances should you buy a Chevrolet Venture.
