He is great in slightly cracked and off-kilter roles. Now and again he is into comedy with good effect. Many films are recommended below, but I recommend "The Dogs of War," from 1981. He plays Jamie Shannon who sets up a mercenary takeover of a small African country. This flick really shows Walken at his best, in my opinion.
