She is encridebly great, I love her... anyway, she made me jumping around my house when I got her autograph :) She is the real actress, can you see the different characters she played, succeed like a charm.... I don't understand why some people don't like her acting, she is very talented, and she has a nice voice...plus she cares this world, she make it a better world!!
