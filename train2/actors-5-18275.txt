Full Metal Jacket is one of the most overrated movies of all-time, right there with Fight Club and American History X. Testosterone-feuled mediocrity. But is shows how ambitious Kubrick really was, and when you're always striving for greatness you're bound to stumble sometimes. Kubrick was a genius director who tackled varied subject matter with the same amount of vision each time. He deserves all the praise in the world.
