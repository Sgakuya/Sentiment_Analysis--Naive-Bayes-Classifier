Elizabeth is a legend and has done marvelous films. Don't understand why she isn't near or at the top of this list. She was at her best in Butterfield 8 and Cleopatra. What a great actress and beautiful face. Saw her in a play with Richard Burton in Los Angeles and it was spell-binding to see those two together. Also love the movie Virginia Woolf. Liz is great.
