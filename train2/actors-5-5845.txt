In my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio is THE BEST actor of his generation. I've been a fan of his work for as long as I can remember. I've seen and own every single one of his movies and his is a brilliant actor. He was phenominal in What's Eating Gilbert Grape as Arnie! That took true talent to tackle that role! He has good looks and a wonderful personality. He is, all-in-all, the perfect catch. #1 on my list! :o)
