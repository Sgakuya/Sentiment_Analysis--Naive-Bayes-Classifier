Some people would say I'm too young to appreciate the work of classic actors such as Fred Astaire. But I have a constant eye on Turner Classic Movies, always looking for more from him. He was an extraordinary actor, dancer, and singer. His smooth tap dancing made me want to learn to tap. I just wish today's society could like movies again that had the clean fun of the Fred and Ginger movies.
