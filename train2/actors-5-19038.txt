I think the 2nd season adds a bit more chaotic feel to House, maybe it's a bigger scheme that Stacy is so close (in the hospital), and his addiction will continue to deepen, so he acts crazier than the 1st season. But at the same time, it's a lot of fun to see where all these are heading. I for one will stay put and get entertained every week now it's back on schedule.
