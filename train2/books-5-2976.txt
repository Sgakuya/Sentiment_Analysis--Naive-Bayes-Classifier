My favorite King novel and one of few books that can actually scare me. A groups of friends reuinite after 27 years to defeat an evil force of nature. There are many memorable scenes in this novel; I've read it three times. Another huge doorstop of a book, this one is over 1000 small print pages in PB. In my opinion, this is Kings masterwork and will be read for generations to come.
