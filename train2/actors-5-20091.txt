She just keeps getting better like a magician she continues to pull these amazing tricks out of that bottomless talent pool she seems to carry around with her. I read somewhere she was worried that in some scenes she was too much like Scully. Gillian if you read this Scully couldn't be within light-years of Lily. You are an inspiration. I hope Gillian rewards us with many more of her wonderful movies well into the future.
