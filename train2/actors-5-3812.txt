I have to say that I don't feel Bruce gets enough credit for his acting. He brings a presence to the screen that draws you into the story. If you have ever heard him in interviews he is a very personable person. Many famous people have said he is a excellent friend to have because he listens and is there for them. The guy has done it all, T.V(moonlighting),commercials(Lipton),cartoon(Bruno the Kid),resturant chain(Planet Hollywood),80's singer(Return of Bruno),actor(Unbreakable etc.), and finally a family man who loves his daughters very much. He is a man to be looked up to and admired.
