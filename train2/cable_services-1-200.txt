They currently show infomerrcials in my area to try to get new customers and I'm not to impressed. For one, you have to pay for installation, unlike with DIRECTV and DISH NETWORK where it's free. You must own a high priced HD television set and you have to get local channels through a off air antenna unlike the others. Plus the channel packages are more expensive for fewer regular cable channels like A&E or the History Channel. I'm sticking to Directv which is adding even more HD channels everyday.
