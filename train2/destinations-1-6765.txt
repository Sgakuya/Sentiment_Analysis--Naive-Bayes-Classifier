Tboneya- As someone who attended college in South Dakota, lives in Minneapolis, and whose parents live in Oregon, I will tell you that South Dakota is extremely unsatisfying, and that Sioux Falls is no more than a big suburb. There are many, many progressive thinkers in Oregon, in places such as Portland and Eugene. There are also some country bumpkins. South Dakota seems to be filled with the latter.
