Emma Thompson is a first class actress. She was wonderful in The Remains of the Day , Much Ado About Nothing and Howards End . She also gave an impressive performance in Primary Colors in which he played the wife of John Travolta (A Southern Governor running for President who is plagued with scandal after scandal due to his womanizing). I thought that she did a wonderful job balancing out her character's struggles (dealing with her husband's affairs) and greed (pretending they didn't exist in order to preserve his political career). In the final analysis, Emma Thompson is a wonderful actress and person who has a lot of depth and range and chooses her roles very carefully.
