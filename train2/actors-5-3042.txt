Regardless of the problems Mr. Crowe may face in his personal life, his acting ability stands without question. His ability to delve so deep into a character that for a moment we forget it is an actor and not the person he is portraying puts Mr. Crowe in the leagues of such names as Olivier, Tracy, and Peck. His performances are not staged or coached, they are just in the moment. Certainly one of the best on today's big screen, Russell is worth whatever you have to pay him, or put up with.
