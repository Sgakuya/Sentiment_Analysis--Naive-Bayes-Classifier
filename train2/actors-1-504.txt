Truly dreadful. One of the worst actors ever to make it to star status. Played the same part time and time again, and each time it wasn't convincing. Stiff, turgid and mannered performances. A real tough guy who wussed it out during WWII, but was ultra gung-ho during the Viet Nam fiasco when other peoples' sons were getting their asses blown off. Tells you quite a bit about the so-called man. A phony hypocrite from day one, and so bad on the screen that I'm embarassed for him.
