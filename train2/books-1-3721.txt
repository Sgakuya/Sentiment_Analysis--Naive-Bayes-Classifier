It's a better than average book, but it doesn't belong near the top of this list. Firstly, its not "classic" literature, by any stretch of the imagination, and secondly its just not that good. I suspect that since it's on the curriculum in most high school programs, it's rated so high because it's one of the few books that a lot of reviewers have read. Look, ask yourselves, is this a better novel than Sound and Fury, The Razor's Edge Huckleberry Finn Pride and Prejudice, all of which are way down this list. And frankly, if the answer is yes, the counter-answer is that you're an ignoramus.
