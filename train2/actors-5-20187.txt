I love Courteney Cox Arquette. On friends she is the best. I am sick and tired of hearing about Jennifer Aniston...Courteney has got her beat in TWO things. One is Courteney is more cuter, more attractive and WAYYYY more sexier than Jennifer. Two is Courteney is WAYYYYY more a talented actress then Jennifer. I can back this up by saying look at the SCREAM movies. Courteney proved by playing Gale Weathers the sleazy reporter, that people including myself think WOW I cant believe this is the same person that plays Monica. As well Courteney is the best FRIEND out of the gals because YES she is a neat freak but she is the most caring and considerate. Pheobe is a ditz and Rachel comes off of being quite a slut. Though these are the good points of Courteney, I have two bad ones. The first is with her talents Courteney has NEVER been a lead role in a movie. She definately has the potential to be a lead in a movie. The second is marrying David Arquette. I think she is to good for him and he does NOT deserve such a women like Courteney. Ah well what can you do right? anyways I wish the best for this beautiful talented actress.
