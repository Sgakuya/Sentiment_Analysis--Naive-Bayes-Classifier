Ok, Ok, I'll admit that I used to not like Renee Zellweger, because she always looked so pouty and unbelieveable...then came along Bridget Jones's Diary. Albeit BJD is a chick-flick, I have to admit, it was hilarious and so true-to-life in many circumstances. She was phenomenal in this movie. Great job!
