Overrated. Probably the most conservative, right-wing city in the world. Good luck in the job hunt if you're thinking of moving here. The free market is taken seriously here, so there's no unions to protect employees. Many blue collar workers don't even have insurance (their Cuban bosses see that as a form of socialism). In the job hunt, priorities are first given to Cubans, then non-Cuban Latinos (I happen to be Latino myself by the way, so I can say this!) Everyone else is pretty much a second class citizen. On the positive side: Nice beaches, cool clubs, and good for a visit, but I wouldn't live here.
