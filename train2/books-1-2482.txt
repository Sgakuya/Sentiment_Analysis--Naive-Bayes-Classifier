I think Go said it better than I ever can. The whole time I've read it I've encountered only one joke that was even marginally amusing. Still occasionally hilarious in a very unintentional way. If you want to recycle this garbage into something useful try this at home, cut out the Family Circus without the caption, put it on the house bulletin board, and have anyone who feels like it write a new caption.
