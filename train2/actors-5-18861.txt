Baz Luhrmann is simply amazing!! All three of his films have been brilliant and beautifully abstract (not to mention very well acted). I first heard of him from my 10th grade teacher. I had never seen any of his films (I didn't even know he existed) at that time. And then she put his song Everybody's Free (to wear sunscreen) and it had some of the most bright and insightful words and that started giving me the impression that he was a brilliant, charismatic, and very cool person (I still think that today about him). Then my teacher put on both his and Franco Zeffirelli's versions of Romeo + Juliet when we were studying Shakespeare in class. His version of it was the first film of his that I have seen and it was just so fantastic that it (I'm sorry) blew Zeffirelli's version out of the water, cause Luhrmann's was brilliantly updated to our time. And then amidst all the Oscar buzz I bought Moulin Rouge without me having previously seen it. I bought it mostly because of the fact that it was directed by him. And after seeing it, I was just simply amazed by it. It was beautifully and brilliantly done and all but deserved it's Best Picture nomination. And after seeing Strictly Ballroom , I thought it was a good breakout film for him. All in all, Baz Luhrmann is as great a director as he is a person.
