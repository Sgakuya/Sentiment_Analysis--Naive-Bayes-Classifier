Bobby D is one of The Great Ones. Sure he's played in a number of mob movies, but I blame that on the industry rather than the actor. If you find a cash cow, you milk it. That's Hollywood! When I watch him on the screen, I am totally mesmerized. It's unbelievable how much one person can give to his craft. I once wrote, I never met a performance by Bobby D that I didn't like, and was dutifully chastied by another avid Bobby D fan. I still stand by that statement. A movie of Bobby D's that I won't see is Bullwinkle. I thought, when I heard he was in the movie, that he accepted the part because he had young kids and that's who he did the movie for. But, I just couldn't make myself go see it. I have come to this conclusion, the perfectionist in Bobby D only allows him to act for one person and that is himself. I believe he is acting for himself and not for the masses, and that is why he is so great. If he makes a few bucks along the way, that's just the icing on the cake. LONG LIVE BOBBY D!
