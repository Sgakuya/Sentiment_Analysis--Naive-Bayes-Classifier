Nominated for an Oscar for his latest movie The Cooler with Bill Macy. He holds up very well in this movie against the formidable talent of Bill Macy. Too bad he's involved in domestic dispute with his bimbo ex-wife who is trying, and not succeeding, at shaking him down for more money and exploiting her child for this purpose. He's one tough survivor though and will probably win out over the witch with a B. As for his politics, doesn't he have as much right as Bo - Duh - Derek to expresshis views. I hope he gets an Oscar for The Cooler.
