I love Courteney Cox! Who cares if she's too skinny, she is still adorable! I love her character on Friends .... Monica is just so damn cute!! I enjoy her ability to give a comedic performance. She is a good actress otherwise too. I really enjoyed the bitchy Gail Weathers in the Scream movies. All in all, I am just really diggin this chick! My only complaint is, why did she marry that drugged-out, off-the-wall, weird-as-hell guy whose best work recently has been dialing 1-800-CALL-ATT???? Come on Courteney, you can do better than that!!!!
