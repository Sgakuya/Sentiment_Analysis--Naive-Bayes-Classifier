An actor who grabs your attention the moment his very presence is on the screen. He speaks with confidence is aware of the surroundings that his characters are in and almost controls every scene that he partakes. A man that is not only a tremendous actor who is dedicated to his craft, but a man who is a strong and positive role model to all devout working fathers and husbands in this world. He is the very decorum and essence of what a movie star and actor is all about. I wish him every success in the furture and believe me hes going to be around for a longgggg time.
