Whether you like it or not, Arnold single-handedly reshaped the face of action heroes, and has taken part in two of the most classic action movies of all time, Terminator 2, and Predator. I think he is a great actor. And he doesn't always play a shoot-em-up, gun totin', killing machine. He is also known for his comedic abilities in movies like Jingle All The Way, Kindergarten Cop, and Twins, which were all great, hilarious movies. Arnold is one of my favorite actors of all time, and rightfully so.
