Here is my 2000 F-150 experience,here goes,total trans failure,idle air control valve,ignition coils and boot,DPFE sensor[2],ABS module,plug blew out head,3 sets of rotors[countless pads],driver window motor, c.d player quit,headlight knob came off in my hand,passenger side mirror FELL off.I finally got rid of it at 69k.I pity the hard working man\woman that buys that truck.'Built Ford Tough'should be changed to'It's A FORD.....TOUGH'.If you are having engine problems related to plugs or coils go to www.consumeraffairs.com under Ford Engines-Spark Plug Defects,I wish I had read the sad stories before I bought that truck.
