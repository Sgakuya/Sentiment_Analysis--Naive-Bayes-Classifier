From the same patch of Wales as Richard Burton,in whose footsteps he followed;an equally commanding and versatile stage actor,with a propensity for wild drinking in his earlier career.He made his promising screen debut in the admired historical drama The Lion in Winter,but,his compassionate performance in the excellent The Elephant Man aside(he was touching also in the gentle 84 Charing Cross Road),he found few memorable film roles to match his talent..until his mesmerising,legendary breakthrough in Silence of the Lambs,devouring the screen,and human liver,with a scintillating intensity.He was much amused by the terrifying effect his real-life appearances had on the unprepared public- stopping off on dark nights at small hotels,where staff and guests were visibly aghast at sharing space with Hannibal.From then on he seemed unstoppable,following up with more remarkable work in the fine British dramas Howard's End,The Remains of the Day,and Shadowlands.He was compelling as Nixon,and as John Quincy Adams in Amistad.Though there were occasional glimpses of ham in films he took less seriously,he lit up the enjoyable swashbuckler The Mask of Zorro with his riveting presence,gloriously nonchalant in the training scenes with Banderas,then ever-so-tender towards his compatriot turned fellow Mexican,Catherine Zeta Jones.In the extraordinary Titus,he was back in Shakespeare,filling the part of Emperor with a richness few of his contemporaries could match.A great career,and rightly placed with De Niro at the top of this list.
