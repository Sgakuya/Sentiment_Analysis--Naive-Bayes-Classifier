I think Richard Gere is a talented actor, one of my favorites. From drama to comedy, he makes me cry and laugh. He is currently in the Pittsburgh area where his newest movie, I believe will be titled The Mothman Legacy , is in production. And in my opinion is a very sexy man, I've felt that way since Breathless , who wouldn't!
