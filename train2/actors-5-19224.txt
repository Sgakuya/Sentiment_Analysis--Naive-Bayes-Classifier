Matthew Perry is the best! He is soooo hot! Who cares if he gained weight? Well, I don't like him AS much NOW, but I still love him. I am glad he is still skinny! Good luck, Mr. Chandler Bing! And since I love Courteney Cox Arquette as well, I am SOOOOO glad Monica and Chandler are getting married! They are the cutest couple ever-TV and Real life!
