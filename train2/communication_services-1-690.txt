Dirt cheap rate plans, affordable phones, and tons of features.. but on the negative side.. Customer service is one of worst (with the average wait time of 40 mins of more), poor reception, a lot of busy signals. If you call customer service about their service problem they insist that it's the equipment you have.. and they want you to spend money on other expensive equipment thats not necessary. They have very poor indoor coverage.. and these days they want you to sign a 2 year contract agreement... On UC Irvine campus, you'd be lucky if a call go's through during the daytime. If you do get a call, getting cut off is common and you'll have heck of a time trying to dial back out to your party... This is part of the SBC family and customer service is just non existant with this company (Poor Customer service with SBC Landline-Billing Errors). For Orange County, Verizon is a better bet..
