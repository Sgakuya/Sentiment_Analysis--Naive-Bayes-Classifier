This guy cannot be compared to anyone, especially Nicholas Cage (somebody on this opinion board did that). Anyway, he had neverending charm and wit and a little factoid for you people who like useless trivia: he's the only actor to hold the highest rank of any branch of the Armed Forces, Brigadier General of the U.S. Air Force. It's A Wonderful Life will always be a wonderful film.
