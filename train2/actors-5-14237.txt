lets, just say she is one of the best actresses I have seen in a long time, I'm a film student and I have seen people act like their acting, what I mean is you can tell that they are acting, but with Kate every time I saw her in a role, I lost Kate and I only see the character that she is playing, I have seen her act on the stage and on my TV set, and both times I can never find the real Kate I only find the person that she is portraying . and that is why she is a great actress!!!
