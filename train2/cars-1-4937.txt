There is no doubt that GM can build an engine but thats where it stops. I just sold my extended cab 4x4 at an incredible loss, but am happy to just have gotten rid of it. I am very fussy about maintenance, but the unexpected 700R4 transmission problems, fuel pump problems, egr problems etc. left me with a sour taste. Don't get me wrong, a lot of people have great luck with GMs but I simply cannot afford to spend a 1000 every oil change (dividing out my milage with the cost of repairs) on things that shouldn't break on a low milage vehicle. signed a very happy import owner
