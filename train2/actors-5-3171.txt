Gladiator was a really good movie and Russell does an excellent job in the battle scenes as well as the more emotional parts of the movie. I had no idea he was the actor in The Insider. I was shocked when I found that out and it confirmed what a good actor he is. He is great looking too which adds to the whole package.
