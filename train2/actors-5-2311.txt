i think Mel Gibson is an incredible actor, i've seen over 20 of his movies and i love them all, not all of them are the smash hits like braveheart yet i love watching them purely because he's great to see on the srceen, i also think he was so brave to make the passion as by doing this he opened up his heart to the public, and that must be soo hard for actors.
