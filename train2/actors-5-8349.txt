Judy Garland was a great actress because she used every part of herself in a role - her brain, soul, spirit and body. Actress Ina Claire, after watching Judy work one day, said, That girl should work two hours, and then be taken home in an ambulance! How she gives herself! Playwright Moss Hart said watching her was like watching a great musician pluck the strings of a harp. Director Stanley Kramer said that she was a great technician who could run the complete range of emotions like no other performer. I like her because she pulls you in - her humanness either breaks your heart or makes you laugh. As for her drug use, Judy tried to detox 3 or 4 times and resigned herself, at the end, to the fact that she would need a minimum amount of meds just to function. At the beginning and at the end, she really hated taking the pills. She drank to calm her stage fright but never liked it. Yet through it all, she never stopped working. What courage and determination! Toward the end, she said of her audience, I just want them to know that I have been in love with them for all my life, and I tried to please. I hope I did. Boy did she!
