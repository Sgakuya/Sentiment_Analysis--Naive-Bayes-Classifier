Next to Steven Spielberg, the most overrated film director of all time. Those Star Wars films were totally mindless, childish junk. The acting was second rate, the scripts clunky, the special effects not so special, the art direction ridiculous. An attempt at developing a modern mythology that ended up being cartoonish escapist drivel. The Indiana Jones flicks, a total rip-off of the 1930s serials, didn't pay homage as much as co-opted, or appropriated or stole or plagariszed forms and mishmoshed them into a juvenile pastische. At least the art direction was better in these films, but the performances and scripts were pretty second rate. His films are terribly formulaic and depend too much on the franchise approach to filmmaking: nothing very daring or innovative here, just recognizable, lowbrow, easily digested. However, since his films lack any true emotional or psychological impact, they're not very satisfying and don't view well a second or third time. I guess he's OK for kids, like Spielberg, but unlike Spielberg, he's never tried to make a film exclusively aimed at an adult audience, so he's stayed out of the trouble a lightweight encounters when he attempts to handle a heavyweight's job.
