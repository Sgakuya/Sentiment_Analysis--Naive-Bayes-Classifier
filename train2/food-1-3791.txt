Aloha Chips are terrible. A dry cookie with very little flavor. They certainly don't live up to the reputation of a macadamia nut cookie. People who have purchased Aloha Chips in the past are not likely to repeat the mistake the next year. They are our worst selling cookie and we get a lot of complaints about them. They should be replaced with a different cookie.
