She was very beautiful as the Bionic WOman, and the years have been kind to her,. SHe still looks as great as she did back then. Her acting talent has matured, and she is a much more confident actress. The only downside to her career as far as iJR is concerned are those dumb SLEEP NUMBER commercials. Get over it, it's a bed. It ain't gonna change your life one way or the other!!
