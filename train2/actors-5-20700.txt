I think Ellen is pretty damn funny. She did a really good job as Dory. I think people need to stop making such a big deal out of the fact that she's a lesbian. If that's the way she is, then so be it. Leave the woman alone. I at least give her credit that she had the courage to come out and make it public. That really does take a lot of courage. You don't know how the world will take it. But I have a lot of respect for her and I think she has much courage. Power to you, Ellen!
