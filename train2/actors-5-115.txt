Cary Grant is an excellent actor. His gift for acting is showplaced in films such as To Catch a Thief, An Affair to Remember, and one of the best movies ever... The Philadelphia Story (also starring Katherine Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart) He has an intellegent sound to his voice so playing the classy guy seemed to be his forte, (even when he played a cat burgular in To Catch a Theif, along side Grace Kelly). 5 stars? absolutely!
