Talk about screen presence! I've only seen Haley Joel Osment in two films and he completely stole both of them. At least, at his current age, this kid really has what it takes to get your attention and hold it - an attribute with which many adult actors obviously struggle. He is also unbelievably entertaining and completely at ease when being interviewed. I hope it continues to work for him as an actor as he grows up. But, with his obvious intelligence and positive attitude I'm sure he will succeed in anything else he may set his hopes on in the future.
