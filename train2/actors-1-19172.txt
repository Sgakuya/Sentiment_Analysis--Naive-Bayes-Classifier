Matthew Perry is the worst actor of an annoying bunch. Well, I won't even mention his personal problems (drugs) cause everyone knows about that but of all the Friends stars he's the worst. He tries to come off as funny AND witty and ends up looking stupid. He ain't funny. He's not even good looking like his Friends co-stars. Maybe that's why he had plastic surgery to fix that honker of a nose....
