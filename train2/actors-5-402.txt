Bridge On the River Kwai, if you have not seen this movie then you really can not rate Sir Alec. He was the last classic British actor to pass and he will be missed. His work in the Star Wars movies was above reproach but the fact that he even agreed to do the pictures is a testament to is knowledge as an actor and being able to see a script for what it was.
