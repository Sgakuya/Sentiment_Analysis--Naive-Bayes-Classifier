It's not a horror book. Has mild homosexual content (alot of girls really like that part), & is thankfully nothing at ALL like that horrible movie where that woman took all of Louis' parts. I reccomend Anne Rice's early stuff, but anything after Pandora is just awefull. If you don't believe me, check out the Amazon.com reviews.
