Excellent van until the electrical problems started appearing (door chimes, dead instrument panel, etc.). Van is currently in the shop with the head gasket problem (37K miles, Ford refuses towing compensation or rental car). Told the timing chain cover (actually the front cover gasket) is leaking ($835). In researching the problem it seems that this front cover gasket problem is very common in the 95 Windstars as well. Please e-mail any with any details of front engine gasket repairs.
