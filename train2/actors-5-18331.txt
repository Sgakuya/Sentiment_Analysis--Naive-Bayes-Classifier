Ah, Hitch! Who hasn t he either influenced or scared nearly to death at one time or another over the past 50 years? Oh, he s had his critics for sure. But, hey, guess what!? The movies are still running and still being viewed and enjoyed by wide-eyed movie lovers of all generations. Nobody was more adept at blending the macabre with black humor and psychological terror than Hitchcock. If we could check back 100 years from now, I m sure we would still be able to discuss the strangeness of Norman Bates with just about anyone we d find on the streets.
