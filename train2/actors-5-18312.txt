No one else in the mystery or horror genres even comes close. The thing I like most about Hitchcock is that he hardly ever actually showed a lot of blood and guts--he would lead you to the edge, and leave a little something to the imagination. We could use more of his kind of ingenuity and creativity in present-day Hollywood.
