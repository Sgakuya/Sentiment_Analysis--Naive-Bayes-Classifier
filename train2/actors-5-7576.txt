Oh come on people! Patrick should be number one! I mean this guy can ACT, he can DANCE, and OMG can he SING! I'll bet he could become a MODEL if he wanted! It doesn't matter how old he gets, he'll always be tops with me! My fave Patrick movie has to be To Wong Foo because it just shows how diverse he can be in his acting. LOVE YOU PATRICK!
