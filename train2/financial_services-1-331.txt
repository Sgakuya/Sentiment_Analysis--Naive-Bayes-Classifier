DON'T GET A CREDITCARD FROM CAPITAL ONE! A monthly service fee of $6.00 - that's MONTHLY, not yearly, is the first and biggest reason to stay away. God forbid you should go over your credit limit. That's $25.00 more dollars PER MONTH. Then if you're one day late getting your payment in, add another $25.00! I actually paid $56.00 a month more than once just for the privelege of doing businedd with their company. Then when I paid my balance in full and requested they close my account, they sent me another bill for $36.00, which has yet to be explained. Isn't this called loan sharking?
