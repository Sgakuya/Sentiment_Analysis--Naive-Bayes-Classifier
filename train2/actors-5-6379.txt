The poor boy will always be judged by his looks. Is anyone ever going to take him seriously? I don't like his looks very much, but I think he's really a great actor, and when I saw great I mean G * R * E * A * T. I've seen him perform on stage in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and I really believe he's an incredible actor. Just think at his performances in Gods Monsters or The Passion of Darkly Noon ...he's a top class performer.
