Johnny Depp has classic Victorian good looks. He's brooding and sensual with those dark eyes, curling thick hair and chiseled cheekbones. His range has broadened since Edward Scissorhands and he seems to have the ability to play lighter roles like "Pirates" as well as the more serious. He is simply gorgeous to women, but listening to his interviews one sees readily that he doesn't take his looks seriously. He probably even gets along well with men and there is nothing pretentious or feminine about him. He isn't embarrassed to slap on his spectacles in public. Beyond that he's a down-to-earth "normal" Mid-westerner, lives quietly in the south of France with his family in an effort to escape the phoniness of Tinsel Town. He'll be around for a long time and will look just a good when he's a lot older. He probably wouldn't give a darn about these ratings one way or the other. He's a man who dances to his own private rhythm. He does not crave publicity. I find him unique in an industry where other actors will do anything to be noticed.
