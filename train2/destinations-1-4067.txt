There really is nothing to see here that you can't see elsewhere in the United States and Canada. There's much more to do in nearby Minneapolis and St. Paul... really, I've been here a number of times and I can't say that there's been anything that's really caught my fancy. I certainly wouldn't rank it among North American destinations... or even among Canadian destinations.
