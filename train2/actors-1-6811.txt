I liked George Clooney in E.R. I thought he was a very sympathetic character who evolved throughout the years from bad boy to loyal leading man. However, every role he has played since then has been the same as Dr. Ross, just in different clothes. (Apparently he thinks that cocking his head to one side and smiling is acting.) His big-mouthed, elitist, obviously uninformed, anti-conservative stance makes my stomach turn. I now refuse to watch anything that has him in it. He needs to go the way of other liberal losers (think Alec Baldwin and Whoopi Goldberg) and join the Hollywood Squares.
