On December 12th, I purchased a new cell phone from CellularOne located at: 2172 US 41 West Marquette, MI, 49855 (800)491-9999 I purchased this phone to replace one that had gone missing. Nothing was mentioned by the employee about return policies, and outside of a notice at the bottom of the receipt that states phones may be returned in original packaging in new condition within 14 days, there was no mention of any other issues with returning the phone. As luck would have it, a friend had found my previous phone later that afternoon, but unfortunately, it was after the retail location was closed. It was also closed on Sunday, and when I reached the location on Monday, shortly before 6:00pm, the store had already been closed, though the stated hours were till 6:00 p.m. Once I returned to the store the next day, to find that the doors were AGAIN closed and locked before the stated hours of business. This time there was an employee at the front desk and he opened the door for me. When I explained that I wished to return the phone and have them reactivate my previous phone, I was informed that since the phone had more than 30 minutes of phone time on it, it was no longer returnable. This was not told to me at the time of purchase, and the only return policy I was aware of was the one that was printed on their recipt. I believe this to be deceptive business practices and request a formal investigation into these practices of misleading and ripping off customers.
