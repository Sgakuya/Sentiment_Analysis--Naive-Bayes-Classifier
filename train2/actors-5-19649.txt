Jason Behr is perfection! Consummate actor, conveying intense emotion with a quiet subtley and power - in the tradition of the some of the heart throb/moviestar/actor greats like Paul Newman and Rober Redford. This guy deserves to be celebrated on the big screen. And I'm sure he will. Gosh, with guys like JB around, the much-vaunted Farrells and Blooms seem like hollow vessels.
