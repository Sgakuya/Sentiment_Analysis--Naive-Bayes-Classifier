One of the greatest books ever compiled. It is fasinating to read the stories of those oridinary evryday Americans who did unordinary, often heroic, things while serving thier country in time of way. Highly insprirational. If this book doesn't stir something deep inside you, weather it be on a personal level, or a patriotic level, then there is something wrong with you. Everyone should read this book.
