I was given a sample pack to smoke. I like freeby stuff, but I could not smoke the whole pack. They were terrible. Artificial taste to it. Another thing I noticed. The people from RJ Reynolds werent a bit shy about giving samples to underage kids! Now that made me mad! Dont tell me that tobaco companies arent targeting kids. They are!!
