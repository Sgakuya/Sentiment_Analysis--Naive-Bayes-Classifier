i just read another comment by irishgit, and i couldnt be more on her side. Less than zero breaks every rule that a major novel should follow (and in this case that`s not a compliment, unlike what Tarantino has done for the movies): the chacacters have no arch, they dont evolve, nothing really happens, theres no plot, no story, just gruesome scene after gruesome scene. This is a book that pretends to fit in the category of this is the way it was when the only thing that it is is a complete fiction of people who feel less real than Peter Pan. Elliss style and prose are inventive, thats for sure: he uses ands and dismisses the coma as something that must be avoided always, thus his writing flows so fast that you forget what you just read. Maybe he also thinks that you must not care for what happens to his characters.Trust me, dont read it. And if youre not as dumb as me, dont make the mistake of reading the informers, another novel of Elliss that is even worse. Read American Psycho, at least that one is funny.
