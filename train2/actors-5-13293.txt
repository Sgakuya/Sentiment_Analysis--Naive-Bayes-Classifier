Oh my god, she is HILARIOUS on Will and Grace. This woman is such a great actress. Karen Walker is one of the most brilliantly created characters on TV, and only Megan Mullally could pull it off. I love when she goes Honey, what's this? What's going on here? and points at Grace's outfit or something like that. She is just so funny!
