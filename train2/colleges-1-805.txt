UOP financial aid department lacks professional workers which are rude and condesending. After about 9 months of trying to apply for financial aid, my funds were not certified due to the financial aid department not doing what they were suppose to do. Not to mention, I also was approved for the full Pell Grant, but due to the school not getting my funds certified...at all, I recieved nothing from my pell grant. I have called countless times to managers and even the director of financial aid and recieved no phone calls back. I am still trying to fight this issue, but at the same time am stuck with a $3500 dollar bill, in which if I don't make a payment soon, they threaten to put on my credit report. If anyone out there is thinking about trying UOP Online ... DON'T! It's a waste of money and you'll get screwed. I never thought a university such as UOP could be so dishonest and untrustworthy as they are. I will never recommend UOP to anyone. This is by far one of the worst universities out there.
