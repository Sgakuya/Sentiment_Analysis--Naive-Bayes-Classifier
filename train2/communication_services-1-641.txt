Cingular is going down!!! I have been using Cingular Service for 4 years. I never was happy with Cingular, but I was hanging in there until they changed my plan. They gave me a new deal with 600 daytime and 5000 weekends roamfree account. Since they have changed my deal I have been getting unbelieveable bills for everymonth and needed to argue about each one of them at least for 1 hour. Everytime it was a different story. One of the examples is, that my deal is 600 anytime minutes and 5000 mobile-to-mobile minutes!!! I am not even sure if such deal exists. This kept on repeating and repeating and it came to point that they said you need to pay the money. Of course I didn't. I made the argument over the phone and didn't get anywhere, just got treated like a piece of pupu. After couple months they canceled my account. I was fine with that and I was so fed up with them that I didn't want to get in trouble by getting on my credit. So I called them. I said tell me the amount that I need to pay, they did and I paid. After a month I got another bill for $208 for the month that I didn't even have an account with cingular. I was off the hook. I exploded when I saw that the next letter that they sent me was from a collection agency. They are claiming that I need to pay another $208 because THEY terminated my account. That is just sucking consumer's blood. I don't want to pay the money, but on the other hand I don't want their name on my Credit History. Anybody know what I should do? I don't want them to get away with situations like this...
