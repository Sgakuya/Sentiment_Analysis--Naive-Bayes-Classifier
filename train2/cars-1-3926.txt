My 2002 Chevy Trailblazer that I was going to have at least 10 years has been in the shop 13 times in 12 months. It has stranded my wife and two children twice in sub zero weather. Twice towed, and four loaner cars. Engine and fuel problems make the bad shock, and broken wiper motor seem trivial. Anyone want to buy a truck?
