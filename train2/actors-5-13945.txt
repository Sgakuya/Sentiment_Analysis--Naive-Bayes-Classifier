Julia Roberts can be made fun of just like the next actress, but you may not want to mess with this Pretty Woman. She has risen to the top, appearing in hit after hit, and she should walk off of this list at #3 or #4. She has won an academy award for her most recent film, Erin Brokovich. Other credits include: Mystic Pizza, My Best Friend's Wedding, and Runaway Bride.
