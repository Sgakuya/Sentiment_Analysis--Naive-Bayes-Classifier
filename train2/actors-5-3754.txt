Think for a second - Moonlighting, The Sixth Sense,Pulp Fiction, Armageddeon, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, and of course Die Hard. Bruce Willis is a damned good actor who can go the whole range of acting. Has done a lot of so-so movies - Whole Nine yards, Fifth Element, Twelve Monkeys and could stand to do more drama and less action, but he's proven he can deliver.
