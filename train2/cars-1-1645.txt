Not a bad car, but what is terrible is the way Caddilac does thier business. Take a 16k Chevy Malibu, put Caddy badges on it, and it instantly becomes a 30k car. Same thing with the Escalade. Take a Chevy Tahoe and put Caddilac names all over it, charge 20,000 more dollars. Terrible. $30,000 for a 200hp clone ? I'll take that BMW 330i, please...
