DROP DEAD GORGEOUS! Gave an excellent performance as Legolas in Lord of the Rings and although Pirates of the Caribbean looks corny, I'm gonna watch it anyway, just to see him. He looks so good in my five foot something tall cardboard standup of him and Gimli, I can't imagine how sexy he is in person.
