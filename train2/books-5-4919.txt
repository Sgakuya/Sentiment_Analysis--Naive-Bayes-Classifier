I adore Gone with the Wind. I was drawn into the novel about the old south almost immediately. The characters are nothing short of loveable and the portrayal of southern customs, ideals and culture is very vivid. When I was reading it I became so emotionally involved with the characters that once, the behaviour of Scarlett got on my nerves so much I threw the book on the floor and stomped on it (I imagined that I was stomping on her).
