I had bad experiences with telus. Their network dropped call on me after one month into the pcs service. When people called me half the time they got some error messages saying the call cannot be connected. I called the network person at Telus and had to wait for 40 minutes to hear a live person. He tried twice and could not fix the problem still. I then wrote to Telus and complained about the poor service and the long wait. All I got was a reply to call their customer service line. No real solution there. Two days later after that, the phone acted up and froze on started up screen (most phones telus has are low quality LG phones, I used a LG3200 and it sucked big time). So I called the Telus complaint line and told the nice lady about the issue. She gave me the run around saying the reason why I had dropped calls could be the phone had problem not the network. So I had to send the phone away for repair and got an old loaner phone which has a short battery life about one day. Anyway, since I had no contract with them so I signed up with fido's unlimited incoming calls. Two days later I called telus to cancel my service, the customer service rep at telus tried to play guilt trip on me for switching. He said how would you want to sign with a company thay nearly bankrupt... how telus has better network than GSM etc.. and told me to cancel my service with fido since it was within the grace period. But I said I was basically ticked off with the poor service telus has and fido has better plan. He then claimed that telus has the unlimited incoming call plan too and its same price as fido..and told me to check telus's website. I checked telus website 2 days ago and there was not any mention of it. What a b.s. So I told the dude that I was not calling to argue with him so he backed off. I would never use telus again.
