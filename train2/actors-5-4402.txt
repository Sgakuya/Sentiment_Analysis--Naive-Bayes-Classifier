Jason Isaacs is a huge hunk of eye candy and I've got a sweet tooth!!! But besides his latest performance in The Patriot, his previous roles give evidence of an actor who can cross all bondaries in protraying characters. I can appreciate both his pretty eyes and great talent. I hope he gets the opportunity to show more of his skill.
