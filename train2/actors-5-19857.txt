After seeing Miss White's extraordinary performance on BOSTON LEGAL this week, she deserves another Emmy. This lady has such a range of talent. One might not think the zany Betty we've known all these years could be so believable as a murderess. She has been wonderful on this program in the role of secretary. Also enjoy her enormously in the GOLDEN GIRLS reruns. It's wonderful that she is still on TV so often and making us laugh all the time (even in a courtroom drama fighting for innonence).
