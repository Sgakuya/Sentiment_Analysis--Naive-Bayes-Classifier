Sela is one of the best actresses and one of the most beautiful women alive. This lady has more sensuality in one eyebrow than Pamela Anderson has in her entire body. A symphony of emotion, beauty, grace, charm, talent, and intellect, Sela is the epitome of luxurious, earthy femininity. Fantastically real, I call it. As her co-star, Billy Campbell, said: You'd have to be a fence post not to have chemistry with Sela. Sela is routinely called one of the good guys by her Hollywood peers.
