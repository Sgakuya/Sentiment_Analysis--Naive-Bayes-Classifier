Really, all chew is nasty, but as a girl growing up w/ 2 older boys, I had to be as cool as them. So, in 4th grade, after eating sardines w/ mustard, I thought I would be the tom boy that I am and take a dip from Copenhagen can. I thought I was going to do. Sardines and Copenhagen do not go well together. I think I spewed a good 8 times that day just thinking about it.
