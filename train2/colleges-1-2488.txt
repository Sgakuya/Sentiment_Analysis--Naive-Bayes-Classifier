I attended BYU one semester as a non-Mormon (I'm Presbyterian), and I couldn't wait to escape. Superficially, everyone is superficially nice, but it was obvious from the first day that non-Mormons are outsiders, not part of the state's (and the university's) dominant culture. For me it was especially sad because in my field of study, foreign languages, BYU is outstanding.
