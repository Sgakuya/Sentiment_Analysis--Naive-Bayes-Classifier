This is a pretty awful comic! I useally just glance at the strip( or circle), but the jokes are pretty lame. Like for instince, Who Wants to be a Millionaire is on telivision, and Little Billy says after a few seconds, why is'nt no one talkin'? Dosen't everyone want to be rich? THIS COMIC IS VERY LAME! PLEASE DO NOT WAST YOUR 10 SECONDS REAFING IT!! PLEASE!!
