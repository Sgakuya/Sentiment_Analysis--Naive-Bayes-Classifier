Marlon Brando be damded, if Russell Crowe is to be compared to anyone (even though an actor of his calibre needs no comparison after he's proven himself) it is none other than my other favorite, Anthony Hopkins. They both smolder with intensity. Both can make the most mild-seeming charactor seeth with a hidden virility. Check them out together in Austrailia's Spotswood (AKA The Efficiency Expert to you Americans). From various tales, both seem to have very intense passions about their work, and this exhibits itself in intense performances. In a world of powder-puffs like Leonardo D., it's nice to see there are a few real masculine heroes a la the golden age of film. Long live Russell! Top notch all the way!
