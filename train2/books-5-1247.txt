Gut-wrenching funny much of the time. And he stays out of politics, thank goodness! His work is just plain fun to read. He isn't quite as funny as the incomparable Don Martin, but he comes close. (if I remember right, Gary Larson claimed to be a great admirer of Don Martin) I love seeing animals on their hind legs, imitating some of the weird things humans do. My favorite: the one where cattle are standing along a fence visiting. One spots a car, and signals to the other cows. They all get down on all fours until the car passes, then they're back on their hind legs chatting again.
