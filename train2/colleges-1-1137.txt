I've been on campus at Harvard twice. Once in the summer time when there were no students, and once in the Spring when it was crawling with the young brainwashed tools of government propoganda. The campus is attractive and very historic, unfortunately the liberalism just permeates everywhere, and Harvard turns out nothing but Communists disguised as free-thinking Americans.
