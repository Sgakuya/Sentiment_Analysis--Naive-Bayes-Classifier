Jodie has seem to been around forever. oh yeah she has. Jodie is a very talented actress, sexy, smart, talented, etc. I rate her as a 5 as an actress and I would have to rate her as a 4 as a role model. I realize that people like their privacy but the way she treats a certain person in her life in the public eye leaves me a little disappointed in Jodies decision. I feel if you are willing to spend that much time with someone and truely love them you wouldn't hide them from anyone. Silence of the Lambs is one of my all time favorite movies. I wish Jodie was proud of everything she is. I love her almost as much as Gillian Anderson.
