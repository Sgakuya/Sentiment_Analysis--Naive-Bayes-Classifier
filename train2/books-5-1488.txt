This has to be THE BEST COMIC STRIP EVER!!!! Anytime I read the comic section of a newspaper, Peanuts is the first strip I look at. In my opinion (this IS the OPINION NETWORK, isn't it?!) Schulz's Peanuts comic strip was EDUCATIONAL as well as ENTERTAINING!!! Thanks, Charles Schulz... you are a RARE GEM!
