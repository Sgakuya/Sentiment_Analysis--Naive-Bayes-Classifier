If the only movie Rob Reiner ever directed was This Is Spinal Tap, I'd probably still rate him five stars. Spinal Tap may be the funniest movie ever made. Add to that a couple great feel-good movies ( The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally ) and a solid drama ( A Few Good Men ), and there's no question that Reiner deserves five stars. And that's not even mentioning The American President, Stand By Me, and The Sure Thing.
