George Clooney is a cool guy. He's got a look and presence that reminds me of actors in the 60's - he'd have been great playing opposite a Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Curtis,Jack Lemmon etc....He just looks and sounds like a Rat Packer and comes across as a smooth operator who has everything under control in his movies ( Ocean's 11, Three Kings, Out of Sight). He's got a great voice as well.
