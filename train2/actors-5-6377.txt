Probably the best young actors out there today(by young I mean hasn't had there prime film years in the 1970's or 1980's), Brendan Fraser is one of the only people I can think of that has made only good films. With most actors, whether you like them or hate them, ahve some good, some not so good. Not so with Brendan Fraser. The Mummy, Blast From The Past, Encino Man, Mummy Returns, even Dudley-Do-Right. They are all good films.
