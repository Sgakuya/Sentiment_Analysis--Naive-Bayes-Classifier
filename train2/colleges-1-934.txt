What a waste of money! The field reps (some-most) are rude and don't want to do their jobs. Even for DE you still have to go stand in line for an hour or so to register for your classes. Isn't this DE, DISTANCE education? I've taken 4 proctored exams. 1 of them was never sent and 1 was missing an entire page when received by the instructor. Often you have no idea what your final grade is for a course because of these pitfalls until well into the next semester. That can be rather depressing. Don't even bother emailing the administration. They won't respond. UMUC brags how they cut breaks financially for military. Their tuition is as high if not higher than that of a resident state universities. Go to a real DE University, I am as soon as I find one that I like. UMUC should be ashamed of themselves for even calling themselves a university.
