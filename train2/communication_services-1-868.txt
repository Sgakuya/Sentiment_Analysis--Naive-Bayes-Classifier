I traded in my Fido phone for a Telus Phone with a two year contract. I got behind in my bill ($78) and they disconnected my service. I had it paid off before my next bill came in the mail with a $78 past due ... -$80 payment then a whopping $500+ for breach of contract. The very same day I got this bill in the mail I also got a phone call from the collection agents saying they were collecting for Telus a total of $475. They can't even get their numbers straight nor give customers a break. (I offered to give them $200 deposit to re connect). When calling Telus they told me my detailed payments and the days they were paid and admitted that when it was sent to collections I owed them $0. When asking if I can get my phone re connected they said it was too late that once it is in collections there is no way to call it back. Then asking if I can get the details of my payments mailed to me they told me they don't have access to my file that it was all sent to the collections (this AFTER telling me my detail payments). I have since paid well over $500 to the collection agent with them telling me I still owe them $140 (interest they tell me .... ALOT of interest in a month if you ask me since they told me a month ago i only had $250 to settle and since gave them $240.) Anyways.... although FIDO didn't work in all the areas that I required it to I now regret ever trading in my phone from them.... They had good customer service and even though I was late on a bill or two they never cancelled my phone or sent me an outrageous bill. I will NEVER EVER use Telus again and will make sure that everyone I talk to hears my disgust in their cruddy customer service
