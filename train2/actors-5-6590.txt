Greg's an amazing actor! This man can do anything, that's what I think. He's got an innate sensitivity about him, a boyish nice-guy charm with a twist, a wicked sense of humour: you name it. He played Simon (in As Good As It Gets) with such presence - it was the single most moving performance I've seen in a long, long time. And his hilarious stunt in Mystery Men (as Captain Amazing, for Christ's sake) proved he's got a natural talent for comedy, too.
