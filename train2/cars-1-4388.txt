My parents bought one brand new in 1995. In 1996 one year later, the automatic transmission absolutly just broke, this van was my mom's, and she was 48 at the time, and she never put any stress on this van. When my dad complained to ford the people at ford acted like we were talking in a different language. They didnt do anything until my dad got on a well known national radio show, and bi#ched about it on there. Then ford called us and told us they would help pay for it. My family would probably not have switched to chevy because of this problem, but that damn van had an expensive problem every 6 months including the head gasket, so now my family, is a chevy family.
