Hilary is an amazing Actress, who has worked bvery hard to get where she is today.. Her acting Talent in Boys Don't Cry shocked me.. Pretty good coming from the unknown actress who took her high heals and her dresses on 90210 ro Boots and Hats in The Motion Picture Boys Don't Cry, she desrved to win all 22 of those Awards for that Acting she did.. Hilary will reamian an A list actres, She just proved it again when I went to see The Gift whch is a movie that is new and has ner in it, She did the part well and with real Belief... Another thing that Hioalry seems to really well in, is When i see her at these Award shows, Her Dress's are Gorgeus and she loosk Fantastic in them and is All The Way Woman, being maried to Chad Lowe... Hilary im your fan, forget what cheery whatever screen name says about you, you are not rude you are very nice, and my Friend says so, they saw you pick your outfit out for the sags and they said you weer so sweet... Hilary I love ya, and you are one person to look up tooo for young actors and actress... You ahve the Talent and the Digentity that will keep you going for a lifetime... Goo Hilary
