Definitely one of my favorite books when I want to get away from all my problems, although Scarlett's shallowness can become tedious the story is well-written and take you back to the times of the Noble Cause. I feel the sequel accurately represents all the characters and brings a happier feeling of closure to the story. I would just like to know where all the Rhett Butlers of the real world are. A true man that takes responsibility for all of his actions and loves deeply and sincerely. I guess that died out with the war, but I keep hoping I will be proved wrong someday.
