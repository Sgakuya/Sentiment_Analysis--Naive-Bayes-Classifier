A fair, but not uncritical account of the life and times of John F. Kennedy. Robert Dallek is an astute historian who definately put a lot of time and effort into this novel. I finished this book in about five days- I literally could not put it down. Dallek explores JFK's life- the young sickly boy who everyone thought wouldn't survive, the teenager unsure of what to do with his life, the navyman, the congressman, the senator, the president, the husband and the father. Highly reccomended!
