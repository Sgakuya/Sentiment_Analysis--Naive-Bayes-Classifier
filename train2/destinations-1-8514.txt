The Miami Seaquarium is in SAD condition. The animals are not healthy, and are used and abused obviously for the Seaqauriums own profit. The Orca tank (the shape of a fish bowl), and much too small to house a beautiful marine mammal for the past 33 years. Lolita can only swim in circles, and does her tricks on command, because if she didn't, she doesn't eat. There have been hundreds of dolphin deaths, and one Orca that I know of. The Seaquarium, also known as MiamiSeaPrison has been sighted for 36 Fire Hazards and 127 Safety Violations. Nothing has been done to correct the problems. Please look at: www.MiamiSeaPrison.com before you consider buying a ticket. The ancient bleachers may collapse any day, if the Orca tank doesn't split at the rusty, leaking seams first! Certainly not a place I want to bring my daughter! PLEASE, DON'T GO, AND DON'T BUY A TICKET!!! Marine Animal Captivity is WRONG, and the MiamiSeaprison is a perfect example. Do not expose yourself or your children to such a negative, archaic, insensitive way to entertain ourselves. I suggest ANY other activity or form of entertainment, but please, from a Mother of a young child, do not teach our children that capturing marine animals and holding them captive is OK. Let's change the trend and teach children to respect animals - not abuse or kill them. Thank you.
