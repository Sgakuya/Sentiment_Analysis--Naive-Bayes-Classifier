There was an interesting interview with Chris Rock in which he was saying how great Morgan Freeman was as an actor, and that out of all the tremendous movies that Freeman has done, the most important role that he has had was in the movie Deep Impact. Chris Rock went on to say that the reason why this role was so important, was because Freeman played the president of the US, and nobody even remarked on it. In Rock's opinion, Freeman is the only African American actor who could have pulled that off without the media making a big deal out of it...Freeman just has so much presence that nobody even thought twice about it.
