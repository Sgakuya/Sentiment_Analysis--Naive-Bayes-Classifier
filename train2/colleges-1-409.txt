Please. I don't know what people are on who gave Lancaster 5 stars. I suspect the marketing people are busy doing their job! They certainly spend a lot of time promoting the management school. In reality, Lancaster is a large depressing concrete university with one of the highest suicide rates in the country. It rains all the time, is expensive, and there is nothing to do besides get drunk. The faculty spend far more time researching and in my experience really hate teaching. Foreign students apleanty, but rarely do they mix outside small cliques. just look at the other comments; funny how two mention '22 nationalities' in their class!
