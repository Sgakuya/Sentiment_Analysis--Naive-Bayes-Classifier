I wasn't too impressed with Josh's Faculty role, but I just recently saw Pearl Harbor at the theater and realized Josh's talent and potential. He's not only gorgeous, but seems to be introspective and intelligent. Women fall for him because he's like the old time classic movie stars, with the perfect smile, the broad frame, and sexy eyes. I think Josh will definitely become the so-called next big thing for all of these reasons and I wish him the best of luck in everything!!
