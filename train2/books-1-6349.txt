Don't waste your money - it will probably all go to him, because this man is a liar and a crook, as evidenced by his book. Poorly written, chock full of fake facts, and by God, where does this idiot get off? I distinxtly remember a passage in the book that clearly voiced his belief that the sole purpose of women is to have children for and take care of their husbands. Well, I'm sorry Rush, but this is notm the 18th century anymore, and as a girl I do not put up with that kind of crap. I may be female, but at least I have a mind of my own, even if this living propaganda poster doesn't want me to. Also, if any of you have read the part of the book about homosexuality, what facts, what scientific reasoning does he use to PROVE that homosexuality is a choice or is evil? None. He uses a four-line passage from a bookwritten a thousand years ago that has been interpreted in countless ways. Not worth reading. I will listen to these homophobes when they come up with a NEW argument that includes FACTS. I'm sorry, but this guy cannot write, he is unmanageably cruel and ignorant, and please do not allow him to make any more money off the sales of this piece of trash. Take care, everyone!
