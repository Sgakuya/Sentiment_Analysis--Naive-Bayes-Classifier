2004 - bought new and paid cash. Piece of sh+t. So far at 3500 miles. 4 new brakes. Replaced pinion gears, bearings, all wheel clutches, and the Dam Differential. And then the drive shaft too. And even more stuff I don't understand, and the darn thing still whines when we drive it. This is a NO BUY. Were going to hire a lawyer now and get it returned under the Texas Lemon Law.
