If you are tired of diets, and gaining and losing weight, this is the book. It is a LIFESTYLE, not a diet. This plan works because it requires less than 5 hours per week of exercise, and it allows you to eat whatever you want one day per week. This helps you to conquer your cravings. I have lost 32 lbs in two 12 week sessions, and my wife has lost 24 lbs. But we also gained muscle. This plan fits our busy two-career lifestyle perfectly!
