Great book, my first Chinese cookbook, just inspiring to read & Barbara's style was fantastic. I was lucky enough to eat at China Moon twice in the Mid 1990's on two separate visits to San Francisco, and was astounded by the taste and inventiveness of the food. A lot of the recipes require substantial prep time or depend on other ingredients. Not easy food to make, but very tasty nonetheless.
