I used to like Hilary Duff on Lizze Mcguire when the show was about how shes a normal but kinda losery pre-teen, and what she goes through, and one could almost relate to it. Then the show became a show about her little adventures, whilst she prances around with her straitened hair, and LOADS of make-up on. She looked like she was a 15 year old trying to look like a 20 year old. Now, shes singing! She could barely pass as an actress and now she has a record deal. All I have to say is that her voice is terrible, but thanks to digital enhancement, and synthesisers, shes managed to have hit singles. Does the world really need another superficial, shallow ditz? Well, we've got one, and some stupid people seem to love her. SHES SO FREAKIN ANNOYING!
