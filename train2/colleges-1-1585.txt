The Square is the creme de la creme of networking groups- only accepting members who graduated from the most prestigious colleges. (http://www.thesquare.com) A group of Wash U grads recently visted The Square headquarters in New York City and petitioned for membership. The were rejected and laughed at by the Board of Directors of The Square. The Wash U grads asked The Square, If our academic reputation score goes up to a 4.3 next year, can we then join? ...and pleaded, How about if our overall yield rises above 29%? How pathetic!
