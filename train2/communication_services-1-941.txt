AT T has truly disappointed. I hooked up with the Nokia 8260 phone as a X-mas present for myself. Well as soon as I dig myself out (its snowing big time in NY) I'm returning it. Every call I've made either the connection has broken down or the reception sucks!!! I refuse to stick it out for a year. Thank God there is a 30 day money back guarantee!!!
