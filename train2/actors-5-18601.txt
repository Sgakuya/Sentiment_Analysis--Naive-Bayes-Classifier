Many people seem to dislike Lucas now because of his Star Wars Special Editions and for Episodes 1-3(even though 3 hasn't come out yet). However I must say I have really been inspired by him. Star Wars Episodes 4-6 are pure masterpieces and probably the best movies ever made. Without those you probably wouldn't see the special effects you see in movies today. And I find the special editions just as good(or maybe better) than the original! While Episode 1 wasn't that good, I liked Episode 2. And don't foget the Indiana Jones series. Great epic adventures with loads of comedy wonderfully blended. Way to go LUCAS!!!
