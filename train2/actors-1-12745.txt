 1. She is too greedy. I read that Gwyneth was offer a role in the hit movie, Charlie's Angels. But Ms Thing was annoyed because the producers won't give her more than $10 million. So Gwyneth backed out and star in the Duets Bomb. The role went to the lovely Lucy Liu. 2. Her constet bitching over the Oscar and Brad Pitt 3. Magazines portray her as a fashion icon. But most of those clothes don't fit her. 4. Being Madonna's pet. 5 Sluts in love was a terrible movie. The Oscar should have gone to Cate Blachett.
