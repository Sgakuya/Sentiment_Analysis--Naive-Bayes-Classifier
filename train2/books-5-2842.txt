Not surprising that this book won a Pulitzer. Exciting reading, yet highly educational and thought provoking. Not only does it provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the principles of atomic physics, but puts him in the room with the people who made the discoveries and the decisions that led to the creation of the bomb.
