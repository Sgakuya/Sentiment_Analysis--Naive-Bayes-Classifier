Jimmy has only improved in the short time he has been in acting. His talent is so versatile. He can go from one role to the next and make a believer out of you whether the part is comedy or serious drama. I haave seen most of his performances and I can feel the part he is playing because he puts so much into it. I think what sets Jimmy apart from most child actors is that he wants to be doing this. It is a passion for him, where as for others they have been thrown into it by their parents and it's more of a job. I think Jimmy looks forward to the challenge of each role. He also has gained the respect of the major actors he has worked with and the directors and producers. This will definately land him more roles for the future
