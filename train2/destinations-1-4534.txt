I live in Scottsdale, and overall I think the whole area is terrible. Don't move here, its unbarably hot, boring, and homogenous. It's a hole that you can't escape. The vannila culture boils down to vitrolic conservatives, chain stores, strip malls and asphalt. The crime is horrible. Most people who like this place are either from the midwest or have not been anywhere else. I want out.
