I absolutely loved this short story growing up. From a writing perspective, the idea of writing a story in diary format when every day you have different mental capacities, is really interesting (and not unlike Diary of Madman by Gogol). The story itself is sweet, sad, and inspiring - this is one of my all time favorite short stories.
