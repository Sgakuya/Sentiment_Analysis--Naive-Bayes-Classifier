Incredible. We need more actors like him. You think the only reason he is sucessfull is because he is the brother of River Phoenix? Think again. Joaquin has it. The It-Factor. The full package. I never heard of him prior to Gladiator. He blew me away in that movie. But the I saw him in the movie with Geofrrey Rush (I forgot the name) and he was great too. It doesn't matter what kind of character he needs to play. He can do it.
