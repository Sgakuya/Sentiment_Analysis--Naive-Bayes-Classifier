Picked these up on sale yesterday and a few guys I know down at the bar love these things, but now I have no idea why. Sure, the 2 stage "filter with a hole" gimmick looks different, but what you get isn't smoke, it is more like warm auto exhuast. Nothing about these, from start to finish, resembles a tobacco product. The taste is just a harsh mixture of chemicals and their intention is simply to deliver (very little) nicotine. If I weren't so cheap I would just toss these. Avoid at all costs.
