Mary is a multi-faceted actress and good both in TV and films. She did a great job in Ordinary People but mostly I thought she was excellent in The Mary Tyler Moore Show. She interacted so well with the other characters - who by the way are not on Rate-it-All lists: Valerie Harper, Gavin McLeod, Betty White, etc.
