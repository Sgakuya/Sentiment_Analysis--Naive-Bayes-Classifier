Scary. Just thinking of Mounds gives me the chills. The gross dark chocolate covering, the nasty coconut middle. Sick. Both of those characteristics make for a nightmare candy bar for me. Nothing is worse than dark chocolate. Coconut makes me sick. The texture alone gives me the willies. I would say that this is my least favorite candy bar.
