Christopher Walken is an extremely talented man, one of my favorites. He is so convincing in his roles,and he is very versitile. I loved his scene in True romance, it is my favorite piece of acting of his. I cannot say enough about him, he belongs a lot higher up on the list. He doesn`t seem to get enough recognition for his talent. I just love this man!!!!!
