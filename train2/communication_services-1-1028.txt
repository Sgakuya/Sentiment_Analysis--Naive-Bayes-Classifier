We've been with Cellular One for over 4 yrs. Two phones on same contract. First they don't even suggest to you a change in plans when you are eligible.Why should they, they stood to lose money that way. Next, if you get your phone stolen, that doesn't warrant them giving you a loaner phone until you replace yours.Add charges to your bill that shouldn't have been there to begin with. Such as 3 reactivation fees, when my phone was stolen. It's like they punish you for other peoples actions. STAY AWAY from CELLULAR ONE
