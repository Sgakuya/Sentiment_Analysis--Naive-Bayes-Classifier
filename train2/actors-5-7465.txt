A terribly underrated actor, Jared Leto was radiant in the heart-stoppingly beautiful Requiem For a Dream. His pain and yearning was so aptly conveyed and would have made me forgive any youthful stupidities(URBAN LEGEND!) Besides that little lapse, I think he picks his material wisely. He was great in My So-Called Life with the ever whining Claire Danes and greatin Girl Interrupted with the ever snivelling Winona Ryder. He is also very, very cute.:) Not as cute as Jude Law, mind you, but cute nonetheless.
