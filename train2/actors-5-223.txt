Simply the best of the best. Compare the best that American cinema has to offer today against Cagney and the best of today will always fail. Cagney could dance, he could do light comedy, and he was the most menacing, and charming, of tough guys. White Heat is one of my favorite movies, but it's essentially a comic-book. Yet Cagney is able to transcend the prosaic limits of the film and invest his improbable character with a life and vitality that can still strike a chord with audiences all these years later. There'll never be another actor like him.
