Kevin is the most unlikely (and probably unwitting) sex symbol to come along in a long time, but that is undoubtedly what he is. Is it his sense of humor, his warm brown eyes, his wicked grin, or the awesome abs unleashed in American Beauty that make him a sex symbol? We all have different opinions, but the fact is just about everyone likes him, for whatever reason. I personally go for the warm eyes, the little tuft of chest hair that peeks out of his shirt when he leaves the top button undone to TORMENT his female fans, and yes, the abs helped too! :)
