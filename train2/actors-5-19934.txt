I like Sarah Michelle and while I am not saying that she is award-winning or anything, her work really is enjoyable. The point of acting is to entertain and despite her critics, I feel she really accomplishes her goal. Who cares if she makes popular teen shows and movies? She makes the choices and I feel she performs her characters wonderfully. She is both talented and versatile and deserves credit for that.
