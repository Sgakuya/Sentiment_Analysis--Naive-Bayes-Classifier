Scott Wolf is much more than a pretty face. His acting ability excells in both dramatic as well as comedy roles. His talent encompasses both the large and small screen as well as the stage. What impresses me most about this man, however, is his activities outside of the spotlight. He unselfishly contributes his name to as many charities as is humanly possible. Both humans and animals are the recipient of his wonderful doings. He has yet to find that major break-out role which will rocket him to superstardom in the public's eyes, but I know it is just a matterof time for this gorgeous down to earth man. He definately has the ability to become the character he portrays. Even if he never plays another role he will continue to be my favorite actor of all time, and his humanitarianism a role model for all to follow.
