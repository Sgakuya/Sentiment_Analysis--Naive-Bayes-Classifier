Of all the stories and novels written by Jane Austen, THIS is by far the best. I got the humor the first time around, which I cannot say for Mansfield Park, Emma, etc. This is the absolute first book I reach for when I want to spend an afternoon reading, curled up with a cup of tea. And if you enjoy the book as much as I do, don't miss watching/renting/buying A E's miniseries...about the closest adaptation I've ever seen...the casting was perfect.
