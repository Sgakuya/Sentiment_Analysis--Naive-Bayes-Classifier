There are very, very few actors out there that just suck you right in to their performance. Whether it's a good guy or a bad guy, you feel like you just have to watch this man, whatever he's doing, whatever he's saying, in any role he plays. My favourite role of his has been Sergeant Horvath in Saving Private Ryan, with a close second being Colonel McKnight in Black Hawk Down. He does so much justice to the military characters that he's played. And, yes, being that I am a female, he is incredibly attractive with gorgeous eyes and a very manly-looking chest. Hmmm...
