Katherine Moennig is what made me tune into Young Americans every Wed. night. Katherine did such a great job playing a boy that I didn't even know he was a she till she showed us in the pilot. Kate is an amazing actress, she also is very kind to her fans. Not many actress AOL IM you back! You can't say too many good things about her. Even though the WB didn't pick up the series I am a devoted KM fan and look forward to seeing her in other projects. I only wish her the very best! **Plus the is gorgeous! :)*** Jamie
