The climax of Rice's original Vampire Trilogy, and also where it should have ended. This was, in my humble opinion, the most action packed of the set. After this book, it all went down hill. Facing off with the Queen that he awakens, Lestat and company have to deal with the fact that being immortal doesn't mean you can live forever. Very gripping.
