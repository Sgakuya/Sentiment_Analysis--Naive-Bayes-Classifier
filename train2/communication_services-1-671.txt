Cingular SUCKS! I can not wait until my contract is over! I am being charged for calls made to another phone in my family plan which ran my bill up to $1,100. When you need to talk to someone or get some answers no one seems to have the patience or the knowledge to deal with it. If you are considering cingular service, please, please, please think agian!!!!
