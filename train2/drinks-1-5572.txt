I was totally excited to try a Pepsi that wasn't as sweet as regular Pepsi. I like Pepsi, but often find it just too sweet. Imagine my disappointment when the Edge tasted sickeningly sweet! What?! I thought it had 50% less sugar?! I scanned the ingredients, knowing what I would find - some manner of artificial sweetener. (The disgusting aftertaste told me that.) Yup - sucralose, another name for Splenda - 600 times sweeter than sugar! Yuch, yuch, yuch! I dumped it down the drain, completely disappointed.
