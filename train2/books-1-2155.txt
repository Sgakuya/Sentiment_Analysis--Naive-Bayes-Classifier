Much of the voting on this cartoon seems to be stacked. There's no way it should be anywhere near the top of this list. I'd never even heard of it when I saw that it was ranked above Bloom County, while some of my favorite cartoons aren't even reviewed here. I've checked it out now, however, and I wouldn't read it for any reason.
