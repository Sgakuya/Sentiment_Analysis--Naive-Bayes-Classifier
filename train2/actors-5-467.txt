The Duke is hands down the greatest movie star of all time and should be near the top of this list. Critics are finally starting to recognize his amazing screen presence and acting ability. Probably deserved two other Oscars for the Searchers and Stagecoach, and could possibly have won for the Quiet Man. I was lucky to be around for the last part of his life and was able to see many of his movies on the big screen. It will be a very long time, not in any of our lifetimes, before another movie star on par with 'the Duke' comes around again.
