I also agree that if a recruiter contacts you RUN! They are like flies that won't go away. I enrolled but, hadn't started classes yet. I decided to go with another school and all the sudden my recruiter quit returning my phone calls. Other people started calling trying to coax me into staying. I finally had to go to the acedemic dean to get canceled so I could get my financial aid released. What a nightmare. It is an over-priced waste of time.
