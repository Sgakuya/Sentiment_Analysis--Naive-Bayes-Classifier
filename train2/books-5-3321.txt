EXCELLENT!!!!!I read these books 10 years ago and I have re-read them at least 6 times since then.A haunting story and beautifully written.A must- read!V C Andrews really knew her stuff in this the first series she wrote.Cathy is a beautiful girl who struggles through her life and with the love of a very unlikely man,she ends up full circle.
