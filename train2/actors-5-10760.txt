Annette Bening is my absolute favorite actress. She's beautiful, brainy, elegant, talented, and a good role model all in one. She has a way of lighting up the screen like no other actress of today. That's not to say that they're aren't other incredible actresses out there. I just think Annette brings an incredible warmth and glow to the screen that can only be matched by actresses of earlier generations. She is that one rare fish of the sea. While she was incredible in her award winning, critically aclaimed role in American Beauty, my personal favorite is her role of Sydney Wade in the American President. I also love that she can break away from the more serious roles and become a little zany, yet adorably funny in movies like Mars Attacks and What Planet Are You From. If you've only seen one or two of her movies, I encourage you to see more, because no matter what role she plays, she plays it with precision and class. If ever I had the chance to meet and to talk to a celebrity, Annette Bening would be the choice above all choices. I admire her greatly, not only as a gifted actress, but as an incredible woman.
