The MAN!!! This guy seems to have appeared in about half the movies made in the last fifteen years, and is amazing in every role. Only Christopher Walken can equal Steve Buscemi in deadpan delivery, but Walken is starting to become more obviously aware of how funny he is when he acts sinister. Buscemi is a true character actor, willing to subvert his own persona to that of the role, unlike these stars who play the exact same role in every film (Willis, Schwartzenegger, Julia Roberts, etc...)
