I think Joan Fontaine is one of the most talented actresses of all time. She was versatile in the type of roles she played and was convincing in every one of them. Her performances in SUSPICION, IVY, REBECCA, LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN, JANE EYRE, and LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN are all terrific.
