This woman is beautiful, is an amazing actress, and chooses wonderful roles without regard for money. She also has the guts to have a womanly figure in the acting world. I couldn't believe it when everyone was criticizing her as fat when she was in Titanic. If that's fat, then Calista Flockhart is chubby. Kate is simply beautiful. When did everyone decide women should look like skeletons with big heads?
