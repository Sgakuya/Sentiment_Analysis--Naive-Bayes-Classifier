I am totally with Lisa980et, Miss emsy, and V seceret 5! You know what her weight has nothing to do with her acting ability and all of those who think she is anorexic.... Do you really think that what you are saying is helping If she was anorexic i think she would most likly be way to weak to act and too sick to get out of bed!! I know this because I battled it and let me tell you that just because someone is skinney doesnt mean they are anorexic or bulimic, and you want to know something.... anyone could be anorexic or bulimic they are diseases and you dont have to be skinney to have them Just think about it !!!!!
