A brilliant, hilarious book, a laugh a minute or more; sometimes I was laughing so hard my sides hurt. This is probably the funniest book I have ever read. The humor is on many levels: the situations are comic right on the surface, but the book is full of clever literary parodies (look for Franz Kafka, The Trial; Don Quixote; The Odyssey; ... you find more). One of the best things about unbelievable, insane Ignatius is that he HAS A POINT. I still use phrases that I learned from this wonderful book. Five stars!
