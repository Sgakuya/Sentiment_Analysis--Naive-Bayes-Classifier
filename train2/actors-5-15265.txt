She was the typical child-actor of the late 60's and early 70's. Very unique voice and happy-go-lucky roles. Voice of Lucy in Peanuts, she played Lucy Winters in a very memorable episode of the Brady Bunch. Her biggest role was in the Clint Eastwood movie The Beguiled, a very fascinating, dark movie if you ever have the chance to watch it.
