With all the premium 100% agave tequilas available in the US now, this best selling tequila here in the US is one of the worst. If you refuse to spend the money on a premium tequila, at least spend a little more than the cost of Cuervo Gold (Especial) and get one of the lower cost 100% agave tequilas (ie. Cuervo Tradicional, Cazadores). Note Cuervo Gold gets it's color from coloring additives and not from aging in barrels like the good stuff. Also being only 51% agave, the rest is sugar.
