This is certainly the worst tasting of the Woodchuck line of ciders. I've found that it is really really hard to finish even one bottle. Very acidic in taste, hardly any sweetness to it and as far as I can tell virtually no redeeming values whatsoever. Don't buy it, don't drink it, take my word for it.
