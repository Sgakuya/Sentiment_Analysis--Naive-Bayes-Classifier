As a whole, I find her revolting. She is NOT pretty, but handsome in a very masculine way. She is a hispanic-but-wants-to-be-anglo woman. The blonde hair used to look absurd on her very dark skin. Now she's gone to dark hair again, but somehow even that doesn't help her looks. I think her figure is disgusting, flat sagging chest, and her ugly oversized bottom. Also, if I had that forehead, I'd wear a baseball hat all the time. If her hairline recides anymore, she'll be wearing her already thin hair in a combover. All I think is trailer, or shall I say barrio trash when I see her.
