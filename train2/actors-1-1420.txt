A very overhyped actor with no talent whatsoever, I just never really understood why everyone coos over him...and even the overrated movie titled THE SHINING didn't do it for me, it just proved to me more how lousy his acting truly is. If he has any good credits to his name, I guess I would have to say he did good in TERMS OF ENDEARMENT and maybe in ONE FLEW OVER THE COOCOO'S NEST....but even then it is pushing it...
