Carmen Electra is gorgeous. She has a great body. People talk about silicone, but those legs and butt are real. But what I like best about her are her magnificent eyes. She has the most beautiful eyes that I've ever seen. I don't know what she was thinking with Rodman (she probably wasn't), but it doesn't take away from the fact that she is one of the most beautiful women in the universe.
