Of the 20 or so single malts I have had in recent years (I own 12)the only single malt I have had that I dislike is Laphraiog--iodine and bandages. I have tried it twice--gave it a second try--but not again. Hate to be negative, but I definitely am at the "hate it" end of the "love it or hate it" choice which you hear for Laphroig.
