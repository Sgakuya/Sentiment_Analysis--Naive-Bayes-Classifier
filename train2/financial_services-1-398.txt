Quick And Reilly is a scheming company out to rip off the middle man! I had an account I opened 4 years ago. They said they sent out a letter to inform me of a $25 fee every quarter. I have not seen it. They have taken me for thousands. I will be sure to inform anyone who will listen to STAY AWAY from QUICK & REILLY (which means: They will Quick & Reilly stick it to you. if a lawsuit goes out I will SIGN UP!!!
