Perhaps the greatest of the screen song and dance men. Took modern dance to a new level of athleticism and both sang and acted much, much better, more convincingly, than Astaire. Great performances in virtually every role he took: The Pirate, Singing in the Rain, For Me and My Gal, and It's Always Fair Weather. Very down-to-earth and unpretentious guy who stood out as the genuine article back when stars were really stars, not like the enduring freakscenes of today like M. Jackson or that positively horrible B. Spears.
