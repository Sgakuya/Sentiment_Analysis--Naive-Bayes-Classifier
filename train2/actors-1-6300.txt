Another pretty face with no talent. I cannot believe that he and Reese Witherspoon are married, not because I think she's too good for him, but because I actually saw the movie Cruel Intentions. Did anyone else see this? I have never seen so little chemistry between two people. Oh well, maybe offscreen affection doesn't always translate well onscreen. 54 was pretty brutal as well, but would have worked if he'd had the talent to inspire empathy in the audience, but no, he was the same bratty non-personality that he always plays.
