I had my first account with bank of america when I was 11 or 12 (xmas club). My parents, of course, had their account much longer. If my parents knew then what torture bank of america would later inflicts upon its customers, I can assure you they would not have helped build this evil empire (c. 1920's). Currently a customer since 1989, I am often asked why I don't change banks. Answer: Bank of America will change its evil ways, period. Until it does, I will do my part to be its conscience. Constantly reminding it, in every branch I enter. Way too much pain caused by this bank to recount here.jdb
