Horribly overrated. If people look past her appearence and focus on her career, they'd probably find an extremely poor résumé. I can't decide whether her acting is just God-awful or she purposely picks really bad movies to star in. She reminds me of J-Lo; as in, she makes a whole bunch of crap films (only focusing on leading roles here) and one decent one and also tries to embrace a heritage which seems so far from the person she really is. If her oscar speech and the hit and run never happened, I'd still think she was a shite person lacking in an arse-load of talent.
