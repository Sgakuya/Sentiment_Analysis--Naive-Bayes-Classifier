At first i thought she was a less pretty more sedated version of her mom. But she does have a kooky gracefullness.However, i saw her do an interview and she slammed rolling stone ...for putting people like britney spears on their cover instead of a real goddamn musician that's a quote. and i thought wow this broad has balls. The guess who i saw on the cover of rolling stone the next week pushing their film almost famous. Goddamit she plays a groupie in a movie at leat brit. sings. or trys to. she didn't need the money or the exposure for her film there were other mags. she was on the cover on that month. She could have told rolling stone no, and recommend they put the people that played musicians in the movie on the cover. But no she just had to promote herself. to me she is the real sellout!!
