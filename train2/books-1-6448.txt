I'm sick of people's fascination with stories like the Ramsey murder, the OJ murder, the Monica Lewinsky affair, and now the ridiculously overdone coverage of the Elian story. Enough! As if it's not bad enough that these stories clog the headlines every day, people also feel obligated to crank out books about them.
