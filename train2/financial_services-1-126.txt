My experience with Wells is that they are opportunists, making fee income on overdrafts of less then $1.00, structuring the processing order of debits and credits to maximize penalties for depositors, the worst, I mean the WORST teller line service I have EVER encountered and the least caring officers. I try to take my sense of humor with me if I have to visit a branch. Their employees are like snails on valium. Between customers, no matter how long the line, the tellers chat with their neighbor, shuffle through their cash box, stroll to somplace behind the wall of file cabinets, and do anything possible to avoid pressing the button to call another customer. This bank is the low water mark in an industry who I thought could sink no lower.
