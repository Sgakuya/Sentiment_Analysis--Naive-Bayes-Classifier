I grew up in Miami-Dade county. All I can say that it is the scariest place on the face of the planet.Nothing but a very high crime rate,a bunch of dumb illegal immigrants that cant speak english,terrible drivers,and a bunch of rich republican Bush loving-fake wannabee yuppies.Thats all I have to say.
