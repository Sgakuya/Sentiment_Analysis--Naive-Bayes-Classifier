UPDATE ! I have decided to rate this one over again, as I used some wrong word choices in my previous rating. I still think it is nasty, and yes it still reminds me of the older alcoholics I knew as a child. Hell, the smell of this nasty swill reminds me of that sewer smell...yucko ! HOWEVER, when I said Old Milwaukee is a beer that could cause domestic violence I was being unfair by naming a brand. I think ALL alcohol could contribute to this area in life. If you are a violent person, alcohol is probably not the best thing you could drink. And this is not limited to just Old Milwaukee.
