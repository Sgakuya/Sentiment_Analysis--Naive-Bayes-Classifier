This is one of my personal least favorite cities in the country. I feel that this city is not nearly a major city. The skyline is lacking any major building or architecture and the beaches are below par for Florida. Ponte Vedra and Sawgrass is home to some great golf from what I understand. The shopping is poor and the nightlife is not any better. I think this place is very beautiful in some areas like Ponte Vedra but is run down and filthy in many other areas. My biggest dislike is the age of the population. It seems that there is a fare greater ratio of seniors to young persons here. The clubs also reflect the age of the populous it seems. I think that this is likely a nice town for the over 50 crowd as it provides for relaxation, golf and daytime drinking. The weather has been great everytime I have visited my grandmother in Ponte Vedra, which is a plus. If you are young and seeking energy, vibrance and great nightlife I would go down to Miami or up to Atlanta.
