A person who gets squeamish with explicit sexual descriptions or severe human dysfunction should stay away from this book. However, anybody who can laugh at the dark and quirky side of life should read Choke. Palahniuk is also the author of Fight Club, which focused at times on an addiction to self help groups. The author explores the fascinating world of self help in Choke as well, by having his main character attend sexaholics anonymous meetings. This character's other impulsive behaviors also include purposefully choking on food in a restaurant in order to make money. Palahniuk's detailed accounts of what may be considered abnormal living makes for a great read for more daring readers.
