Wonderful graphic effects, Slow storytelling... But an interesting story... Addictive. If someone tries reading only a couple of strips, they will not get it. Unfortunately, the strip is changing to 3 days a week, so I'd recommend anyone who wants to try reading read a full month before giving it thumbs down or up. I just wish more than a month was available online.
