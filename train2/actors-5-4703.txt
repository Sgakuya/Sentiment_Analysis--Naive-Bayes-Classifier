One of the best actors currently working. Also, he's willing to be in edgy, gritty movies, playing complex, often ugly characters... something very few actors are willing to do today. For those who are more than tired by the prosaic blandness of actors like Tom Hanks et al, check out Harvey in Bad Lieutenant or Reservoir Dogs. Then try to imagine DeNiro (I'm talking about him now, not 30 years ago) having the guts to appear in anything so provocative.
