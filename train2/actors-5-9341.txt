I love Jodie Foster. I think that the intensity that she brings to her roles and the effort she puts into them really shows how strong of an actress she really is. From her earlier performances in Hotel New Hapmshire, to the latest in Flightplan, I think she's a wonderful actress and deserves a lot of credit.
