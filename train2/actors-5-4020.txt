Ralph is the most talented actor of his generation. He has the unique ability to be almost perfectly classically handsome, and downright scruffy when he wants to be. The best part of Ralph is the fact that he never relies on his looks to bring him anything, he always backs it up with talent. Brother Joe ain't bad either!
