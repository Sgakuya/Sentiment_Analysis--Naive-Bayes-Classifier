I bought a used 95 windstar 2 years ago. Unfortunately I did not know about the history of the 95 windstar 3.8l engine. Within the last 2 years I have had the transmission rebuilt, the engine replaced, computer sensors blown, and several bad oxygen sensors. Ford has been virtually non responsive about problems with this car. Thankfully I bought the extended warrenty but one set of repairs took 75% of my vacation budget while I was on vacation in florida.
