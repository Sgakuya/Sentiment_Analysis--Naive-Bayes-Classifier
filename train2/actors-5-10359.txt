Though best known for her starring role in Titanic, she is amazing in a number of less mainstream films such as Heavenly Creatures, Sense and Sensibility, and Hideous Kinky. Her versatility is also shown as the intriguing character of Clementine in the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, my favorite role of hers. She deserves to have a higher profile, but you have to respect her path of embracing films that provoke over ones that aim for the lowest common denominator. She's one of the finest younger actresses around.
