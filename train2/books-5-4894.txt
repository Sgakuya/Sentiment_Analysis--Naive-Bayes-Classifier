This was my first Faulkner novel. I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, especially his near-revolutionary writing techniques. The change of narrator worked well, but it was the first section- the Benjy section- which really blew me away. It takes alot of effort on the part of the reader, but it's worth it. Also try his As I Lay Dying.
