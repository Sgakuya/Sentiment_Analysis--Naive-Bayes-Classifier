Who else could play Rex and Carl, Mr. Pink and Tommy, Garland and Rockhound? He can be totally hot, or pasty and repulsive, but you can't help but love the way he does what he does. He's a natural; completely believable in every role he plays. He can be a substance abuse counselor or a serial killer. A loser or a genius. Who else can fit so many characters into their persona ? Love him, love his work.
