I have been a Mark Wahlberg fanatic since I can remember. I liked his music, although it wasn't what I liked the most. I loved him in Boogie Nights . and Fear was a wonderful movie as well. I enjoyed him in the Perfect Storm (even though I cried at the end!) He was looking very hot in Three Kings also. and my favorite movie which he was in, is The Big Hit even though it wasn't a very popular movie, it is still excellent. I will remain a Mark Wahlberg fan till I die!
