I had a toyota sienna 2000 ce and on july 19th I parked it after picking up my lunch and the thing burned up. I am not kidding it burned to the ground the whole front end melted into a very large blob. I have had no problems until just before and as I was driving back to work about 1 to 2 miles the whole van lost it's mind. The windows started going up and down, the radio started changing stations, the motor was going off and on, and the steering wheel would no longer stay in the upright position. The worst part of the fire was that the automatic doors locked shut and would not open, if I had been in the van I would not have been able to get out. The other this is that the firewall melted. I just can't believe how poorly built the firewall was. I need this message to go out because there is a very real fire danger with this van. All years.
