US Celluar did a promotional thing with the hopital my wife works at. It sounded like a good deal so we signed up not knowing that they had made the hospital the responsible party on our account. We held the account for 4 years and when we went to make some changes on it we found out that we couldnt because we were listed only as the users although we had paid this account for 4 years. They said we only needed to get the hospital to fax them a note saying they were not the responsible party and the account would be switched over to us. The hospital faxed the note and US Celluar shut off our service with no notice. When we inquired about the interruption of service they said we would have to re-apply for a new account. Their service advisors and supervisors were EXTREMELY rude and unhelpful at all. NEVER again will I recommend US Celluar to anyone and I will tell all about their shady billing practices and deceitful promotional ploys!
