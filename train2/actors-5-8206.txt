I have always enjoyed watching Joan Fontaine in her many roles. She could play any type of woman and do it convincingly. She was sweet and demure, evil, conniving and bitchy, kind and romantic in her films. I enjoy watching her ever-changing facial expressions and her eyes as they tell as much about the story as do the words. Though best known for Rebecca, Suspicion, Letter from An Unknown Woman and Jane Eyre, she made many, many fine films which unfortunately are hard to find on video or dvd.
