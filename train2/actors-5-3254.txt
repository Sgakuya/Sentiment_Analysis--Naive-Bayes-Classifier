Willem is by far the most under rated actor alive.His contributions to movies like American Psycho, The Last Temptattion of Christ, Platoon and His unbeatable perfomance in Shadow of the vampire would put most actors to shame. I am a very big fan of this man and his incredible talent as an actor. I cannot get his fantastic performance in Shadow of the Vampire out of my head. He played the eclectic mad man Max Shrek to a T. I can't wait to see what his next project is.
