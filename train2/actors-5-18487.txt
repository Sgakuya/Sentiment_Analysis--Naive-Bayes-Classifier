His first feature film, The Srong Man (1926) featured comedian Harry Langdon and is one of the best silent comedies ever. Mr. Smith Goes To Washington (1939) and It's A Wonderful Life (1946) are two of the greatest movies of all time. His movies over all have a warmth and wit that appeales to the best in us. They are uplifting and inspiring. He is my favorite director.
