She's one of my favorite actresses. I don't think she's weird at all. Remember her background - her parents were hippies and raised Winona and her siblings on a commune without electricity or running water until she was 12! No matter what, she is a beautiful and talented actress. We're lucky to be blessed with her presence. She is so natural and relaxed in her performances and those eyes! She can convey so much emotion through them and her wonderful facial expressions. i've enjoyed watching her since Beetlejuice and Mermaids on through to Girl, Interrupted and other films. She has a long and potential-filled career ahead of her, and I'm sure she'll win the Oscar for Best Actress within the next few years!
