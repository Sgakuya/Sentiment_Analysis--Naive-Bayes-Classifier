As an actress, Julia Roberts is EXCELLENT. She is a very talented person who plays her roles very well. Her only characteristic that disturbs me is that she a is bit too liberal, possibly even a radical leftist. Also there were those comments regarding George W. Bush...BUT we are rating her as an actress and that is what counts ; i am not including her other characteristics. Thats the reason for my rating
