Very UNDERRATED. She should have been the first black woman to win the oscar long ago. She never get the recognition or credit that she deserves. She turned down Monster Ball, but even if she did do it, she wouldn't have won. Its so political. She is just as beautiful. Hopefully, one day, she will get the acculates and credit that she deserves.
