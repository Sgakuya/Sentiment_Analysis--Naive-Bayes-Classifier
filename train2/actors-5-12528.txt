I love Maggie. She is a wonderful, underutilized actress. She needs way more recognition than she gets. She is beautiful, and is not afraid to take on roles many others would turn down. I admire that. She pulled off Secretery to perfection. And why are her comments about 9/11 so disgraceful? Because she was honest? Because she has a difference of opinion? Get real.....
