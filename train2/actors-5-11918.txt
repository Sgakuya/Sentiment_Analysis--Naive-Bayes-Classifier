I have not seen many of her films, but I already know that she is one of the best actresses I have seen. She is terrific as the strong, yet vulnerable policewoman in The Bone Collector. And she helped make Girl Interrupted one of my favourite films of all time. She was terrific and absolutely enviable as the wicked Lisa. While her and Winona are both terrific, Angelina outshone everybody in that film. She is beautiful, stunning, and she can really act. A winning combination. Very sexy. And adorably evil.
