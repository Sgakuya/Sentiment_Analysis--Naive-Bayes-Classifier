Jackson TN - most racist, bigoted place to live. Memphis & Nashville are only a bit better. I recently looked online and noticed (out of those who posted pictures)there are several TN Technology Centers with not a single person of color on staff. Remember, this is 2005, and these are government jobs, believe it or not. Also the Chancellor of the Tennesse Board of Regents says that he advocates diversity. I guess that means whites with tans and without. This state will always be at the bottom of ratings as long as its leaders aren't willing to embrace people of color.
