I just got back to the US after living there for a semester, and frankly I hated it. There is not a lot of exciting things to do and the town itself was gray and ugly. If I was to go to Ecuador as a tourist, I would definitely skip Riobamba. Its a waste of time. The only good thing is the train ride (I got to ride ON TOP of the train), but it doesn't even go to Guayaquil anymore. It just goes til Nariz del Diablo. I recommend Cuenca instead, which is also located in the mountain region. Cuenca has some beautiful churches and buildings, and since it is a bigger city, it actually has a happening night life.
