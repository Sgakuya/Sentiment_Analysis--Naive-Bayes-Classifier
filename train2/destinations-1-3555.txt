Charleston is a great place to be mugged, or have your car broken into. The State/county simply does not have the resources to deal with the criminally insane in the system. If I were alive a few thousand years ago, I would say this place is LOADED with prophets and fortune-tellers. Real whack-jobs on the streets here, poorly- equiped cops.
