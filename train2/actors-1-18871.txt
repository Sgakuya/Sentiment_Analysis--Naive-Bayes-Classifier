Mel Gibson is sick. As for all of you who loved and were so 'touched' by his lying portrayal of the crucifixtion, what a hypocritical thing to say. Don't you all have Bibles that you can read and get the complete and truthful account? Can't seem to work yourselves up into a proper 'emotional level' without the aid of Hollywood. Holy Spirit wouldn't do for you huh? Has it taken all of you Christians this long and with the help of an ungodly psychopath to help you realize what Jesus did for you? Did you sit, squall. bawl and blubber( and maybe nibble a bit of popcorn) like it was recent news. If you are Christians, why haven't you been telling the world? It is so you can gorge your reprobate minds on demonic filth for you self edifying creatures who only honor God with your lips but your hearts are far from him. As for the riveting emotional level, I have the same experience everytime I watch Ole Yeller.
