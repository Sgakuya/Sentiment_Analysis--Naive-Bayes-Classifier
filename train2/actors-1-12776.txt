One of the worst actresses Hollywood has ever seen. How in the world did she ever win an oscar (my guess would be a lot of old men who like pale, stick figures who don't know a thing about acting were voting). I mean, she isn't even pretty. I agree with others who say the only reason she ever got an acting job in the first place was because of her connections in the acting industry. She's an insult to professional actresses who had to work very hard to get to where they are at!
