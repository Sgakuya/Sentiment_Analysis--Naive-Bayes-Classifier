I never saw her as a great actress, but I used to at least think she was cute - a girl next door type. However, Julia Roberts has proven to be the most obnoxious, self-asorbed, loud mouthed airhead I think I have ever seen. She obviously has no morals (the only way she could get a husband was to go after a married camera man), no brains ( he's not MY President - well then, who is?), and no looks (horse teeth and fish lips). It is obvious that the only reason she won the Oscar for E.B. was politics, because it sure wasn't her great acting ability (push up bras plus low cut shirts does not equal talent). I wish she would just go the way of all bad actors and actresses and retire to her ranch in the hills.
