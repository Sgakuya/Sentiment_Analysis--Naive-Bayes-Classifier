I hate what they have done to Guiding light, I don't watch it much anymore because you are gone, You were a role model for many down to earth soap fans. I can't stand the actress they replaced you with. She doesn't know how to cry. And she certainly can't play Cassie. Dinah maybe but not you. Guiding light may have been the longest running soap, but it won't be for long. It's the same hum drum over and over and over. They have totally wrecked the show. I miss you terribly. Wish you were back.
