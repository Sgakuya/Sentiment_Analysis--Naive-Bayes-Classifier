Sean Penn may be a good actor. But his attitude stinks!!! In his interview, Sean insults his good pal, Nicolas Cage. Recently, he compares Bill O'REILLY to Hitler. Why? On his cable show,Mr O'REILLY question if the funds from George Clonney's charity is going to the WTC victims or not. Mr Madonna does not like anybody critizing movie stars.
