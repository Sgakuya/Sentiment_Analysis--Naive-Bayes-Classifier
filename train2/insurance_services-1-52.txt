there'a not enough hours in the day to tell you how much I F* HATE, HATE, HATE, HATE, HATE PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE. Uncaring, rude, no support, better get a second job if you think they'll help you (both parties) after an accident. They assume you walk. Leave them asap! they will NOT help you. They will NOT answer your questions! They will NOT EVER do anything that is BENFICIAL to you. God help them! PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE SUCKS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD. SO BAD. EVIL.
