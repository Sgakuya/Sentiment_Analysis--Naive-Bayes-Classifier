The book is dificult to read and ambiguous. It is a sales pitch for other products and would be found in the bathroom of my house with pages ripped out. The bottom line and jest of the whole pitch is: There's a sucker born evey minute . Don't become the next sucker, stay away from this unreadable garbage. Work hard, save your money and don't waste your hard earned money on this drivel. For every sucess there are ten thousand falures.
