Sprint service has been terrible in two states now. From cut off phone calls and lack of service during evenings free period I get no reception here in Manhattan (NYC). In general, mobile phone service in America is patently terrible and the whole contract thing sucks. Getting charged for receiving a phone call? Charged for SMS messaging? Ridiculous state and local taxes for lack of service... where's my representation? Sorry to get on the soapbox but just wanted to rant before I change phone companies.
