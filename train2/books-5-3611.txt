Shakespeare wrote Hamlet around the time his father died; shortly after this his own son died. Something had happened to him, psychologically and emotionally; his first play after these events was the first great tragedy produced in Europe in two thousand years. It is infinitely complex, and I won't even attempt an interpretation in a capsule opinion on this website... except to say that Hamlet is far more than an indecisive man; he is maybe the most intelligent man in literature, and shows the paralyzing uncertainty of one who thinks too much and too well. Don't look at him as a man who couldn't make up his mind (the condescending and utterly stupid introductory tag from the 1947 Lawrence Olivier version) but as one in unbearable agony. Shakespeare's second best play after King Lear.
