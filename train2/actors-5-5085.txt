Will Smith is a much better actor than he is singer (no offense, Will). In Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, they try to depict him as a goofball or someone who doesn't know anything, but he uses subtle jokes that make the show utterly hilarious. He also acted in some really good movies like Independence Day, Men in Black, and recently Ali. Will Smith is so much more sophisticated than many people might realize.
