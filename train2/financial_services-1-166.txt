SunTrust should be the ones brought before a review board, not only CAN'T you follow the online banking but you CAN'T follow the statement. I have been charged over 200.00 in NF, and USF and even after making deposits. WOW, I'm sending my statments to the BBB and Consumer Protection cause when you talk to the customer service reps they have no clue. One rep even said to me I should keep track of my money! Direct deposit account no doubt. BYPASS SUNTRUST if you know what good for you
