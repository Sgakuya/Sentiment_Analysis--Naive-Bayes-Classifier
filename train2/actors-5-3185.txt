Russell is no doubt the greatest actor of our generation. I had never heard of Russell until I saw Gladiator(shame on me!) and I was completely blown away. Since then, I have rented several of his movies, and each time I am in awe of his performances. He has an energy and a fire unlike any actor I have ever seen - he completely commands the screen. It's so nice to see someone who is so sexy that can actually act as well! I look forward to seeing him in many movies to come.
