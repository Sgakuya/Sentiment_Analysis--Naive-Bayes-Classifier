Everyone knows Buddy Ebsen as Jed Clampett in the classic TV series The Beverly Hillbillies, but his talents went beyond just acting. He was also a superb dancer. One classic scene in which he danced was in Captain January, with Shirley Temple. As tall and long-legged as Ebsen was, and as tiny as Temple was, it was neat the way they both kept in step with each other.
