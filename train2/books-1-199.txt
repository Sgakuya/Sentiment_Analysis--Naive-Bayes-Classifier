I browsed through some of this drivel at a Barnes and Noble and noted that a good deal of the time Powell states that even though decisions made by the Pentagon high command were at odds with his conscience, this Uncle Tom Bagboy kept his mouth shut and meekly went along. No wonder he rose to the top of that overrated, overpraised, wasteful and inefficient bureaucracy known as the U.S. Armed Forces: he never made waves. Now, that's leadership!!! Turds float!!!
