Man stripped of his technological environment, without the daily tools and easy access to food...goes insane. Except for one boy. May we call him Zarathustia (Nietzsche). The author paints a magnificent picture of a land where scets are founded, people are murdered, and morality fades into the darkness. Everyone finds themselves animalistic except the one boy who must, as Jim Morrison said, 'run, run, run.'
