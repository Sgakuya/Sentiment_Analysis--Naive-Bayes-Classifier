I lived in SLC when I was a teen. And those teen years were the worst of my life! There is nothing good about this place. Everyone is so reclused and everything is private. When you're a non-Mormon living among Mormons, It's total hell. When I was 13, I remember at least eight of them coming up to the door and trying to convert our entire family. I watched the Mormons every day in high school. I watched them treat everyone else badly. I saw girls get beat up for dyeing their hair. I saw a bishop lean down leering into the face of a little boy and yelling at him for running through the halls. I also knew many Mormon kids who were abused. I knew at least 8 Mormons who practiced incest. It breaks my heart to hear people defending Mormonism when they know nothing about it. A Mormon lifestyle is hell. I met a woman who was on the verge of commiting suicide. Her Mormon husband didn't send her to the hospital. He didn't get her therapy! He send her to the bishop to get a scolding. When people defend Mormonism, They aren't basing what they know on actual expierence. Many Mormon girls have nervous break-downs and get commited to mental institutions. And once they come back, Their communities shun them. Mormonism needs to go!
