I graduated from CU in 1959 in electrical engineering. Was not an education but was rather a hazing stunt. When I went to work I couldn't believe how far behind I was. The normal load for 3rd and 4th year was 23 units a semester. On graduation, (which I did not attend) there was no feeling of accomplishment only relief. The only reason I went here was because I lived in the neighborhood and could live at home and walk to school.
