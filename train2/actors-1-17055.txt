I think she is a one dimensional character that serves no real purpose in any story line. It is hard to become invested in her character because she is evil, she does not bring any emotion, I cannot feel sorry for her because she has done terrible things and seems to get away with them. She is definately not a character that can be a role model. She has killed two people on the show without answering for her actions
