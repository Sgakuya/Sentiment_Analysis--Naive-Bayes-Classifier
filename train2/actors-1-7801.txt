How can I continue to enjoy the work of someone that is using my money to perpetuate their political opinions? I refuse to add to his coffers anymore because of this and besides, I can no longer appreciate his acting, which is mediocre at best, as it is so maddening just to be reminded of what he does with the money we have given him for his acting. I do know that he also does not do business with people that he disagrees with politically so his criticism of his boycotters would be most hypocritical - but then, what is new?
