How did this woman become an actress? I know high school students that act better than her. I just wanna hit her in the Teeth with a stick *it wouldnt be thet hard to miss*, And how did it get an oscar? I know she didn't win it her best feature that fit her personality was as a hooker. Please dont do another movie again. In runaway bride she should have just kept running
