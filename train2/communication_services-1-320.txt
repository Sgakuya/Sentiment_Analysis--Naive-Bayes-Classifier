The WORST company. Kayla (below) who finds their service always excellent clearly works for them. I have written 3 letters to this company over the last 6 months and received NO REPLY. Today I phoned the company. There was a recorded message saying that they were having customer service problems and so they won't be answering the phone for the next month. That's right - it's now October and the message said to call back in NOVEMBER. And at that, sometime in November. I'm not kidding. The number is 1-800-667-0123, try it, you'll see. I checked out the company with our local better business bureau once, while I was on hold with them for 45 minutes (back in the glory days when they answered the phone - well, sort of) and needless to say, they were ranked very very very poorly. So Kayla honey, stop lurking around, pretending to be a consumer, and go do some real work.
