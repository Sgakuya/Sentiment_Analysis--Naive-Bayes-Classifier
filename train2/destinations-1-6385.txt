Traveling through this state was bloody awful- save for some of the fine music in Nashville- and as others have mentioned good barbeque- the state however is decidedly backwards. Highway litter abounds- obese people from all the bad diets and lack of exercise. And they hate northerners. And please lets get off the phoney religious mumbo jumbo- too many many hypocrits and closet sinners for my taste. And yes there are hicks and obese people in the northeast and California as well- but by percentage there are many more in Tennesee.
