her acting definatley needs to sharpen she aint a very good actress- i dont think. Whats this about her being the most beautiful woman in the world, shes alrite thats cos shes got all the money and make up but every celebrety is attractive with make up, I havent seen a celebrety that looks gorgeous without make up . Shes got lovely hair but thats bcos of the professional hair dressers dont u think, no one sees past the make up. Shes getting older now too and her looks wont always be with her make up cant cover it up forever. She models things good though and she chose the right husband hehe! :)
