It has been interesting to see Lexie transform over the last year from the sweet/innocent to the frantic/coniving. I love to watch her...I am very excited to see her react under pressure and especially if they take Isaac away from her. I think she is a great actress and beautiful at that. More Lexie....keep it coming!!
