Man was this a great book or what? I was in the 12 grade when I first read this book and I am not exaggerating when I say one of the main reason why I loved this book because it had my name in the book. I belive it is the very first time that My name was in the book I read. Enough said, I would never want to be trapped on a little island with a bunch of kids to try to live and survive after a crash where all adults were killed. Amazing story....
