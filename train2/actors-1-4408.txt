Hey Leondark, I don't who this Magellan guy is, but I think he is onto something with respect to your boy, Mr. Isaacs. When he gets a film resume which is half as good as Sly than maybe all of you crazed lunatics can open your mouths. Perhaps you missed Rocky, Copland, or Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot, but Stallone proved himself to be incredibly gifted. And, maybe you should clean up your language, Leondark...there are children who come to this site. Keep your head up, Magellan, and be proud.
