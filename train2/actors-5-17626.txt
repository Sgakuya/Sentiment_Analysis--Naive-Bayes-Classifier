Susan is not only a very generous and caring individual, she is the essence of femininity. Her Erica Kane is an icon..though campy...she is the most memorible character in the history of daytime TV and known to a world wide audience. She is perfect in her genre and not too hateful on Broadway I might add....I'd rather watch her than Ethel Merman as Annie Oakley anyday of the week!
