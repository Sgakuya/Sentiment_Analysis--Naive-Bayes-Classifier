I stumbled across Russell Crowe years ago and am glad to see that he is now getting better roles as an actor. I foresee, however, that he will be better at producing, perhaps directing, movies in the years to come. I think this sex symbol thing is truly ridiculous, though. Okay, so the man is attractive. There are many actors in Hollywood who are attractive and who cannot act. It's apples and oranges. As long as he keeps delivering stellar performances, his career is assured. But don't be too suprised if his choices take him back outside the $15-20 million club. That doesn't seem to be his goal in the long run. He doesn't strike me as the type of actor who cares one whit about that and for that reason alone he is my favorite actor working today. I think that the comparisons to other actors should stop. After all, he is original in his approach to acting and is therefore not an imitation. Some say it is flattering to compare; I think it undercuts his worth as an actor. If there was anyone I could pick to have dinner with, it would be him and NOT because he is a babe but because I believe he is an interesting person. There certainly would be some lively conversation, that's for sure. His reputation has preceeded him.
