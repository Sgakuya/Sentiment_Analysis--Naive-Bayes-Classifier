A great actor. I loved him in Roman Holiday as the reporter who takes a princess on a tour of Rome, undercover.My favorite role for him was in To Kill A Mockingbird.he was perfect as Atticus Finch the lawyer who defended an african American man who had been wrongly accused of raping a woman.It was hard to see him play a bad guy. I always liked him in the good guy roles. I heard he was also a wonderful humanitarian. Sadly I heard on the news that Gregory Peck died today another one of our legends. He will be missed.!
