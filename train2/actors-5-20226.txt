Helen Hunt is a wonderful actress. She was amazing in As Good as it Gets and Pay it Forward. The way she acts is just so natural and she never over-acts in any part she plays. There are too many actors and actresses who aren't believable because they over-act, but she doesn't. She chooses her movie roles wisely and is always playing a different type of character.
