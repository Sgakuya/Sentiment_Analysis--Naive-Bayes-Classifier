I remember watching Primal Fearwhen I was 12 yrs.old and the only actor I know back then was Richard Gere.But even at a young age, I know what awesome acting is and that is what I saw in the guy portraying Aaron Stampler.I did not stop watching till I see the name of this fantastic actor and it was Edward Norton.I said to myself that this is an ACTOR.Since then I have been on the watch for this guy's next movie.And in his 2001 movie The Score,Edward again,as always, defined the true definition of acting.
