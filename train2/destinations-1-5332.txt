Pennsylvania must have the most unattractive citizens in the entire country. We were there last week. The women dress like lesbians and the little girls and teens dress like hookers, plus the accents sound like fingernails on a chalkboard. The men are little better, but hey, I did see one in a restaurant that was wearing a clean t-shirt. I was really glad to cross the Mason-Dixon Line.
