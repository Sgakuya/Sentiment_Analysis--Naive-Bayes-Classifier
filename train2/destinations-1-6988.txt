The most over-rated city in Europe.Liked nothing about it.Some on this forum say that London has everything you can imagine.Really?Where is the blue,sunny skies?The beaches?The street life?(so limited and inexistent when compared to other cities like Madrid or Milan).It doesn't look like a grand city like Paris.It's more of a large number of villages put together.Apart from a couple of nightlife areas,it is like a deserted town at night.Boring. And apart from a few grand buildings it is architecturally un-inspiring.And how about those early closing hours?Not for me thanx.
