I saw that someone mentioned the virtual volleyball. What fun is it to stand in line watching a bumch of unsupervised punks stand in front of a screen with arms up in the air? This place is a mess. It's really gone downhill in the last dozen years. The exhibits are usually broken because they are supposedly hands on. That just means that there are a lot of buttons to push - and people push them a lot, so they break!! I watched a bunch of kids run from shoddy display to shoddy display seeing how many buttons they could push! Last week (August '05) I asked someone in their bookstore if they had any books by Stephen Hawking. The chick looked at me like I had 2 heads and actually blew a bubble in my face! To be fair, I have been up to the library there and I got great service. Also, if you can find someone in the halls that actually works there, they are usually helpful with explaining the exhibits, but GOOD LUCK trying to find one. I don't know how mnay people they employ there, but the employees are NOT out making sure the kids don'te tear down the place. They must be hidden upstairs somewhere. I know that I get a couple of letters every year asking me for funds. NO WAY! Admission is ridiculously expensive for the crap they offer.
