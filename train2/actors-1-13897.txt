 I love my life. What a self-indulgent hack actress would say. Oh sh^t! Julia Roberts said it. Totally useless in Ocean's Eleven. Totally annoying in Erin Brocovich (I've never wanted to punch my TV screen before I saw this piece of crap). She made me feel like going Jack the Ripper after watching Pretty Woman. The only thing remarkable about her is her DSL. If you don't know what that means, too bad.
