I thought her performance was stuning in The End of the Affair. Here you have an American actress able to capture a 1950s Englishwoman. Having read and studied Greene, I thought this novel was his best and she helped make it so true to the authors intnetion. While she was brillant as Sarah......her acting in Boogie Nights was fantastic...gentle, relaxed..demontstrating scope....top class
