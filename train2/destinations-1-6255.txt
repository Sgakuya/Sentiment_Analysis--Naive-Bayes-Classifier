It has been brought to my attention that not all people from Georgia are rednecks by TheFreak. There are several there, though, but I do not like stereotyping. I despise the Braves. The Braves are an arrogant team and they know the Yankees are a million times better (the 1996 and 1999 World Series!). The Braves suck!
