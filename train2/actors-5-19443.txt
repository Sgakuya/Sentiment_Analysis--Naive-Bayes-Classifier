I enjoyed his portrayal of the neurotic loser, George, in Seinfeld, as much as the next person. I also found him entertaining in the kids movie Dunsten Checks In..however, after seeing Love!Valour!Compassion! I really respect and admire his acting ability. He became Buzz. I found myself laughing as soon as he walked into the room..simply anicipating what he was going to say or do. He was amazing as the flamboyant Buzz. While he was hilarious, he also brought me to tears with his moving and true battle with AIDS..his frustration, sadness and anger came through. He was loveable and touching at the same time. A true dislay of his range as an actor..comedic and dramatic at the same time. For this, Jason Alexander gets 5*s in my book!
