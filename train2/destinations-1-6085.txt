Nevada is the most boring place on earth.As a matter of fact,it's as boring as a rock.That's why old people come here to retire.In some parts of Nevada,prostitution is legal yet they can't hire 15 year olds and up for a job?In general,this place has crappy weather,people,and when you enter a station,the first thing you see is a casino and smell the rotten stench of ciggs.
