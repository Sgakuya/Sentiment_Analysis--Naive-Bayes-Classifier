I hate hunters, that neon piece of plastic crap that is Las Vegas and most especially morons in sparkly little outfits who think they have some kind of right to exploit animals. I would never have wished this guy any harm, but I find it as difficult to feel pity for him as I would a bullfighter, a race car driver, a mountain climber or any other jerk who plays the odds of nature for recognition or big bucks.
