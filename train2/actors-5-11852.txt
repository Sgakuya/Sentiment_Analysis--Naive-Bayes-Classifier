Anjelina Jolie is like The Catwoman From The Moon ! Everytime I see her in a film, I am so easily enveloped by her beauty and her charisma. She has something about her that cannot be pegged into words, but I'll try my best. She's like a beautiful and exotic wild animal. One wants to touch her, to be near her; but not for too long for fear that this creature could any moment attack and bite one's head off. I think it's that volatile quality that makes her so irresistible to men and women.
