She is only famous because of her parents. she isnt talented or goodlooking. i hate when people say that she is classy . she isnt classy, she is stuck-up. she has lived a privilege life and has never had to work hard for anything. its no suprise that she didnt go to acting school and her first film just happened to star her mother. her father bought her the oscar and she didnt deserve it.
