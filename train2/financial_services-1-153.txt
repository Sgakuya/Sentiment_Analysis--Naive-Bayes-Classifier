citizens, RBS, charter one, it's all the same, big money, big corporate communist scamming. Charter one bank is my biggest fear, owned by fred the shred of RBS royal bank of scotland. This bank understaffs their employees and works them into the ground, and to add a nice spin to it they play these pleasant commercials on TV. guess what folks, RBS has resources to pay for these silly commercials and they want our homes if we can't pay our mortgages. I am banning them outright. I witnessed a girl break down and cry right in front of me because there was no one around to assist with the customers. This is disgraceful and fred the shred should be tarred-feathered and thrown out of the US right along with that texas hitler bush.. I will not bank at charter one EVER!! and I hope at least millions of people read this and do the same. Shame on you Fred the shred and charter one for almost outright slavery of your employees just to make a buck, you make me sick. These are hardworking American people you scottish tightwad!!! I want you out of my country, you treat my fellow Americans like slaves, you are a disgrace!! I could'nt believe it, people were yelling at that poor girl, she was the only one working, her fat boss was just lounging around doing nothing, god I felt bad for her but that's the way these fat cats work, they make the lowest on the ladder work themselves to death while they kick back and rip us off!!! and who do we have to face, people like that girl I saw.. I'll never forget that day, god it was depressing.. Charter One you suck you should treat your employees with more decency that that.. I'm pissed off all over again, I hope fred the shred has a god damn STROKE!!! what bastards..
