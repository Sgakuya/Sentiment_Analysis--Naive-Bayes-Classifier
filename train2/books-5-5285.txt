I read the short story in my language arts class and started crying. After that , I was hooked. I read the book, which was fabulous, the best book I have EVER read in my whole enitre life. And saw the movie. The man who played Charlie Gordon (can't recall his name right now)was wonderful. The story is filled with warmth and love that makes you thankful for everything you have and how smart you are.
