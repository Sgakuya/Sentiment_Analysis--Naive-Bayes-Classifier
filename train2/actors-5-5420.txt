I really hated Rob Lowe when he was part of the Brat Pack . He almost ruined his career with that video during the '88 Democratic convention, but he managed to outlive it and score a brilliant comeback in The West Wing. I think he's become a better person and a better actor for it all, and I for one am happy for him. His impersonation of Shaggy from Scooby Doo on SNL a few years ago killed me.
