I like this truck test drove one and liked it. I'm a Dodge man but it came down to either this or the Dodge 2500. I bought the Dodge Because of its more powerful Cummins HO. But I give props to Ford for leaving this Truck look like a truck and The powerstroke is a great diesel too. Theres no comparison between these two trucks and the GM series. At least the Fords and Dodges can clear the Speed bumps on the parking lots without bottoming out. I saw a new Z-71 and I thought it looked like a lowrider.
