Very sad, David. I'm impressed with your network of buddies, but that's all. It seems that there's a strong fox/dog element running through the top three scam artists on Rate It!. Personally, I'd be embarrassed at a fixed poll that attempted to make my work look more popular than Peanuts, The Far Side and C H, but there you go. Some people are beyond embarrassment. It just accentuates how real the support for those great strips really is, and how little support the scam strips really have.
