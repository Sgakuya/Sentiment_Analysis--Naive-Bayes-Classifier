This novel had a very interesting twist on life, that it made the future look horrible. Aldous Huxley presents a world of test tube babies, social ranking. Worshiping ford, and the infamous drug-soma. I love novels that deal with government control and society's reaction towards it. Huxley writes with such colorful words which make the imagery more vivid and almost real.
