Overrated. Everyone and their brother thinks its cutesy-poo to have Celtic names for their brats these days. You know: Meagan, Caitlin, Dylan, Siobhan, etc. Too Catholic. Expensive as all get-out in Dublin, probably because the Irish know that gullible Americans will buy their overpriced begorrah. Protestant/Catholic internicine war for over four centuries and counting. Gee, sounds like a GREAT place to go.
