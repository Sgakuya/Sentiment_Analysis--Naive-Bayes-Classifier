Would you ever eat raw sugar cubes? I never did nor would I want my kids to. So who thought that by adding some dye and putting sugar into cute little straws would make eating sugar any less disgusting? I just hope that kids will wear their helmets when eating Pixy Stix so they won't hurt themselves when they're bouncing off the walls on the ultimate sugar high.
