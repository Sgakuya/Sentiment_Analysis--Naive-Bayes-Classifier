The best edition for the humanities is the great eleventh edition (1911), one of the most colossal collections of knowledge ever undertaken, containing over 44 million words by 1500 authors. You can still find them reasonably priced if you look around. (If your interests are in the sciences, however, there might be a better choice.) The newer editions are all good, but none of them have the depth and detail of the 11th.
