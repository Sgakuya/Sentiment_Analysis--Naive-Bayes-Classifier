PageNet does not understand that people in rural areas have lives that require beepers too! There would only be partial coverage in my area with the pager I purchased. I was not gaurenteed to recieve 100% of my pages. They had the nerve to ask if I would like to try it for 10 days! YEAH RIGHT! I couldnt even get the test page!!!!!
