Like father, like son . Donald Sutherland has always been an awful actor , and Keifer is no better . His voice grates on me , it's a one-note voice - no flexibility , no ability to fluctuate , just this endless , irritating grungy rasp . How has he ever gotten any work? Nepotism can only get you so far! Got to be his, and Daddy's , loony , addle-minded , lefty politics . Because it sure as hell can't be for talent.
