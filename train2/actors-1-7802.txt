 Always Be Closing , said Alec's character in Glengarry Glenn Ross. This would be good advice for Alec . . . as in, close your mouth, close your house, close up shop and GET OUT. Go live in France with the other fine Frenchmen, like Yasir Arafat's family and Roman Polanski. You're an actor w/no apparent skills or intellect. Good riddance.
