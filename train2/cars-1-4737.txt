I got a 2004 Ranger FX4 Level II.. Worst truck I've ever owned. Based on my experience with this truck I will never buy a ford again. This truck feals so checp and sweeks & rattels so much that I feal like i'm driving one of those battery powered barbie jeeps. FORD Fix Or Repair Daily. Well I've had a problem almost every week.. I have 10,000kms on it and it's been in the shop 8 times. I had a 1994 ranger and loved it.. The new ford products SUCK ....
