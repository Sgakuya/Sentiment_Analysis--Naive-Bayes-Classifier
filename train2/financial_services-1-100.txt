I've been with Wells Fargo back when it was First Interstate. I was the one that opened my daughter's first account with this bank. Daughter had ID stolen 3 years ago. A week ago it showed up at a Wells Fargo Bank with her expired American Express card (this is what they used as second source of ID). The bank let two women of a different race drain her account. They may give her the money back in 10 days after they investigate. She then changed accounts numbers and put password on account. The branch person showed her account on computer with her money in place. This morning, there's no such account and they haven't a clue where her money is. Solution, wait until branch opens and call them to see where your money could be. Tried to call to ask what security will be put into place and make me feel safe and reply is we will check to see if procedures are being followed. I asked and then you will get back to me to let me know what you are doing to make sure something like this won't happen again and I feel safe? His reply, "What do you want to hear?" So now I will encourage my family to move their money along with anyone else I speak with.
