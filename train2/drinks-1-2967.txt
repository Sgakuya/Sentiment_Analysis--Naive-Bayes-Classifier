I can't believe this one is even on here - it is a pathetic attempt by a pyramid scam-type business. This stuff isn't even in stores! Hasn't anyone ever been approached by one of those cheesy XS guys who try to offer you a job? Yeah. . . All you have to do is come to one of our seminars I think a few of those guys actually placed comments here. You know who you are!
