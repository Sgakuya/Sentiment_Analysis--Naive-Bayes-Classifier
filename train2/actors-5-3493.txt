Birdie, Arizona, Moonstruck, those films let me know Nicolas Cage. I own those and all since then. He somehow makes me feel the need to nurture and protect him. I can't think of another actor who could effect me that way. When I see his films I can't wait till another one comes out. I'm just waiting for August for his next hit.
