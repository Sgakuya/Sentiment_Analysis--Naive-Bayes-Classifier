What can I say? Judi Dench is the most outstanding actress I have ever seen on stage, screen or anywhere!! a most glorious actress, her title of Dame could not be more fitting. I have never seen her in a movie, play or TV show where I did not truly appreciate her spectacular skill in the most beautiful art of theatre. gobsmacking n(as they say in England)
