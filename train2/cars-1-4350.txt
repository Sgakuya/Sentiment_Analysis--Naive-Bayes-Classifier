I bought a 1999 Montana brand new. I just spent over $900.00 on brakes. I had to have the pads, the rotors, and the drums replaced, and the rear leaking wheel cylinders replaced. I had only 61000 miles on this van and I do not ride the brakes or drive recklessly. I usually get 80,000 miles on a set of brakes and then I only have to replace the pads. In addition, both tie rods were replaced with 62,700 miles on them. It has been a constant battle with the seat belt light staying on. My wife and I love this van and would buy another if we didn't have such problems. I am saving for a Honda product next.
