Yuck. I try to keep my personal feelings of looks out when I rate vehicles, but this thing is just plain ugly! Good gas mileage, but it should be unreliable. This isnt a SUV, either. Its a redisgned Montana made to look like an SUV. It lacks the much wanted third row. Looking at this junk, I dont blame people for hating the domestics. (Though a lot of domestics are good)
