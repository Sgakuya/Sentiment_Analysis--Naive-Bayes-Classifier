If you say Die Hard, Armageddon, Striking Distance, I say The Fifth Element, Twelve Monkeys, In Country. Bruce Willis' work is exceptionally honest and thorough. He is willing to take chances in order to develop as an actor. He has a rare ability to portray normal people in a credible fashion and to put the viewer inside a movie character's skin. Altogether one of the most misjudged and underrated actors currently in the business.
