Possibly the biggest play ever written, with the most universal theme of all. Lear is heroic because he refuses to accept the fact of evil, and batters himself to pieces against it, rather like Ahab. He even has a kinship to Milton's Satan... look for it if you dare. Edmund is one of the supremely evil characters in Shakespeare, and is in every way Lear's opposite. The two characters never speak to each other in the play--what would they have to say? This incredible, passionate tragedy about the end of the world has only gotten bigger with the centuries; few people take the time and trouble to attempt to come to grips with it; it is almost impossible to stage, with its vast scale and emotional demands; and if it doesn't wring tears from you when Lear is alone in the storm, you have a heart of cold stone. I try to read this again every couple of years, and I always find something new.
