I just wish there was a leader like Josiah Bartlett somewhere in the real world! Martin Sheen makes him very believable, complete with flaws and strengths. His political opinions have nothing to do with his acting, and the fact that the media give his comments more visibility shouldn't mean he doesn't have the right to make those comments. Does freedom of speech only apply to those who agree with us?
