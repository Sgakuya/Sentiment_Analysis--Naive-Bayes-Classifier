JLO no doubt in my mind she should be entertainer of the year.How many people have a #1 album and a #1 movie at the same time or even at any time in their life.If you don't like JLO just watch OUT OF SIGHT one of the greatest films ever made. She's got a great body, shes smart and very kind hearted and I don't see anyone stopping this star of the millineum.
