Think of all the great movies Tom Hanks has been in - Saving Private Ryan, Big, Splash, Forrest Gump, Green Mile, Apollo 13, Philadelphia... It's a long list. Sure he's also done a few bombs (Turner Hooch, The Burbs), but his track record is almost unparalleled. He has a unique ability to portray the Everyman character with uncommon depth, intelligence, and heart. Only a great actor could have played both the mentally challenged Forrest Gump and the wise, compassionate, tough sergeant in Saving Private Ryan. Watching Bosom Buddies all those years ago, who would have predicted it?
