I have never bothered to rate a company before but in this case, in order to prevent this from happening to anyone else, I felt it warranted. If you are planning on moving within the near future, do not go with Dish Network. They erroneously reported a deliquency to the credit bureau citng non-return of the equipment, when in fact they had received it 3 mo earlier. It took over 15 calls to straighten this out(they verified it was their mistake)and it is still on my credit bureau. I will probably have to hire an attorney. They have undoubtedly the worst customer service in the industry. Run as fast as you can to Direct TV. We had them prior to Dish and never had a problem. Glenna R Merriott
