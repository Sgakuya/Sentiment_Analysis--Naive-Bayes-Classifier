Ted King has brought amazing nuance to the screen in the characters of Lorenzo and Luis Alcazar. Two brothers engaged in the same business and with, perhaps, the same weakness when it comes to love, are remarkably different in their expressions, mannerisms, and patterns of speech. Mr. King isn't afraid to let a little bit of his own sense of humor slip out there sometimes, and the character is better for it!
