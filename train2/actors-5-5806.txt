In response to TheFreak's comment. HE IS SOOOOOO HOT!!!!! There I said it. U can puke if u want to, but I said it! Thats not going to change my opinion! As for his acting ability, well, he is about as good as it gets! (Next to Josh Jackson of course) But his looks arn't that bad either. Who am I kidding, he's hot! I though his performance in Titanic was fabulous! I wasn't too fond of the Beach, but hey, u have to have one bad movie now and then.
