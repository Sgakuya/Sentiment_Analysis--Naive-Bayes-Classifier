Bell South is one to avoid. They have rude sales people who are not willing to work with you to resolve problems that they caused. Their answer to everything is to contact customer service. Well, if you thought the sales people were bad, just get a load of customer service. The service is HORRIBLE!!!!! I am overcharged every month and deal with these rude people constantly. I can't wait for my contract to expire.
