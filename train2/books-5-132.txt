This book is a very emotional book reasoned with logic and understanding. Gives you an open-minded multi-dimensional view of what goes on in mental institutions. Shows you the complexity of every character and how they live, their story, their sympathies, sorrows, and joys. The characters range from our main level-headed Susanna to the suicidal Daisy Randone to the eerie Lisa Rowe.
