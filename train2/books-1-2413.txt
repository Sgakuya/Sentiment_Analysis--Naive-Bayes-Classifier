Most comic strips have these things called jokes . A joke is any dialogue or action that makes someone laugh or chuckle or at least smile. Marmaduke is devoid of anything that resembles a joke. Example: Kid: Marmaduke! Quiet! Marmaduke: Woof woof woof. . . (Two panels of woofing) Kid: Marmaduke! No, you can't have my cookie! That's it. I actually feel worse after reading that crap. Marmaduke can't be classified as a comic strip. It's more of a tragic strip.
