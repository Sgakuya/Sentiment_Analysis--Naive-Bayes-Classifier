You know, as much as like the first two thin mint cookies, I get tired after those. I can only take so much mint. I like a cookie that isn't so poopy. It is like a communion waffer from the church of drab cookies. I ate two of these several months ago and I am still sick and tired of them. If you like mint ALOT then you will probably love these thin dark little cookies. As for me, I'll stay away from thr urinal cakes thank you very much.
