thumbs up to cuzi8246om (whom i totally identify with when it comes to friends and personal taste/intelligence). since i was 14(i'm now 21) i've always had a thing for those older and very underrated actors (at least, underrated among my peers). of course like a dunce i didn't know who crowe was till gladiator, which i didn't get a chance to see, but from the commercials alone you can tell how intense he is. i did get to see proof of life and he just blew me away. not to mention his good looks and dead-sexy voice had me totally whipped. meg's a lucky gal.
