I have seen almost every one of Bing's movies, and there isn't a single one that I don't love. Although he really makes me think of Christmas time, he did a lot for the USO tour and made some wonderful movies that aren't about the holidays. There are so many bad things being said about Bing, like the rumor that he beat his children, but that's all it is -- a rumor. There was no proof that he ever hurt his children. The only reason they brought it up after his death was because they didn't receive as much of an inheritance as they thought they were going to. One of his children denies to this day that his father ever laid a hand on any of them, saying that his siblings were just putting their own frustration on their deceased father's shoulders.
