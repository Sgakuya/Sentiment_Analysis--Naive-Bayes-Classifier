Great drive, but engine stalls in motion - engine shuts off on its own whether you are turning or going straight without any warning. Brought it in to be fixed, however problem cannot be sourced out exactly. Even with warranty and problem not being pin-pointed - nothing can be done except to change some parts and hopefully it won't stall again. Trial and error is all the dealer can do; scary.
