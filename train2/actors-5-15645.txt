This French actress gave perhaps the greatest-ever performance of a child actor in the 1952 classic "Forbidden Games". Only 5 years old at the time, she plays "Paulette", a child whose parents are killed in the German invasion. She is taken in by a peasant family, and particularly by their 11 year old son "Michel". With him she begins to play their "forbidden games" to cope with the death and destruction she has witnessed. That a child so young could play such a dark and complex role is amazing. "Forbidden Games" has recently been released on DVD as part of the Criterion collection. It is superbly re-mastered and has two interviews with the adult Fossey. Blaine in Seattle.
