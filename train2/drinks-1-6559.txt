The taste, I find, is somewhat comparable to 7-up... however, the taste is EXTREMELY BITTER. Yes, it's both bitter and sweet at the same time... however, I find it too bitter to enjoy the drink at all. On the plus side, I think they put more carbonation in these drinks than any other soft drink ever!
