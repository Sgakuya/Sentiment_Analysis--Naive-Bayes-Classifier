Bought a 1999 new in Sept. of '98. Power window on driver's side was slow from the date of purchase, when it got cold we had to push it down while we held down on the button. Took it in for repair, still have the same problem. Door locks stopped working right after warranty ran out. Check engine light goes on and off. My dad is a mechanic and was able to get a reading from the computer that said it needs a new Oxygen sensor. Both 1st and 2nd gear burned up in the transmission. Apparently if you get stuck in snow or mud, you can not rock the vehichle out, because of the design of the transmission. The transmission fluid becomes unevenly distributed between the low gears and reverse, resulting in the burning up of the low gears. My father took out the transmission and had it rebuilt. It cost $900. He also put back in the transmission. Would have been around $2000 without his labor and connections. Also there is a defect with the gearshift. 2 year old pulled it out of gear while the key was turned slightly between accesory and off, without applying break pressure. Brakes lock-up in morning with the slightest pressure causing you to almost break your neck. It only has 70K miles, 2/3 of those are highway miles. We never pull anything with it.
