I saw the anti gay church members on TV recently in Mass. The where spewing incredible hate and intolerance in towns near Boston. This in fact does give Kansas a bad image as does the anti evolution crusaders. Perhaps many in Kansas do not support this kind of extremism- but it gives the state the aura of a backwater region.
