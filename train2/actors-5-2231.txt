Dear anonymous(down there): When you are a teacher, it is difficult and stupid to go and pretend to be a lawyer. Robin born to be a dramatic, and funny actor. Please, when you buy a cat, don't make him bark. It works better if you buy a dog. To the rest: Robin is the most great actor in the world... I mean; I love Pacino, and Hanks, De Niro, Hoffman... but if you ask me which one should I preffer for the rest of my life, I will response: Robin . I love him all-my-life ago. I don't know what you think about it, but I like most his version of a ghetto(Jakob the liar) than the stupid version of Benigni(La vita bella). Jakob is sarcastic, like all good jew, and not a stupid clown like(which was his name??) the other guy. I hate Benigni since that movie. =P
