Timothy Francis Robbins. Sexy, gorgeus, lovable, talented, but even oh so married. He can act. Just look at The Shawshank Redemption. He can direct. Just look at Dead Man Walking. He's sexy. Just read some of the coments he has gotten from you guys here on rate it all! I love you guys! Please keep that respect for Tim coming! On my site I have a special place for him, wich includes pics, fact and quotes and even more things you always wanted to know about him. He's so cute, and I really hate Suz. She's a lucky girl, but why can't I too be a lucky girl? It's unfair, don't you think? He's my favourite male actor and I wish to star in a movie with him someyime soon. Really soon.
