Go check out Faye Dunaway's stellar performances in Chinatown, Bonnie Clyde, Barfly, Mommie Dearest, Network, Three Days Of The Condor, Little Big Man. She may not do much important work these days, but she has certainly made her mark and earned her credentials as one of the best of all-time. She's a uniquely beautiful woman who was very proud of her legs(as related in Charles Bukowski's book Hollywood ).
