After watching Titanic (and being bored to tears, I might add), I was completely sold on how beautiful Kate Winslet was. But after reading her interview in Movieline magazine, I was completely sold on what a beautiful PERSON she was. She came across as a genuine, funny, smart, and down to earth woman. She is like a lady of the manor that all the servants would like. She was captivating in Holy Smoke . After seeing this film, I couldn't help being blown away on how extremely talented Winslet was, too. I would love to see her in more things but, alas, Hollywood would prefer to sell us Gwenneth Paltrow. But let's hope Kate never has to compromise herself or her weight to win a role in a movie!
