I've been a memeber of Citibank Driver's Edge card since 99. The card agreement states that there is a cashback option for rebates after 5 years. I called to claim my rebates and the customer representative was extremely rude. She said that the program was discontinued three years ago and a letter was sent to me. I told her than I have never received a letter stating the program is closed. She shouted at me repeatedly: "can you hear me? The program is closed. We have sent letters to all cardholders" and refused to let me speak. I was really upset at her attitude and told her that I'd like to close my account so that I will never do business with them. I also asked her to transfer me to someone that I can talk to. A few minutes later, I was transfered to someone equally rude. I can hear their laugh in the background. I told the second customer representative that I would like to talk to her manager and would like to have her name and id. She said that she is the highest level of representative that I can speak to and they do not give out their names. If I would like to complain, she can give me an address to write to. I insisted to talk to someone instead of writing a letter. She laughed and repeated that there is no one I can talk to. After 5 minutes, I gave up and hang up. What kind of customer service this is. I wish a customer is treated with respect. If the program is indeed discontinued, I have the right to know in advance.
