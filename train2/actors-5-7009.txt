Ok, my life dream is to be an actress, but Wes has given me the final go-for attitude. His undescribable role in American Beauty moved me. I felt like I was actually in the movie. I repeatedly watch the movie just to get that feeling. I often pause the paper bag scene, where the tears are edging from his eye and the screen is viewed in closely on his face. I just stare in awe. I feel like I know him. I dream of having a recreation of him come to my town, no matter how weird a character that person might be, I've fallen in love with an image, a fictionary human being. I long the moment to meet this marvel of a man that has made me feel like that. I want to be an actress, and noone believes in me. But aren't those the people who usually succeed? I think so. So if you read this Wes, I love you. I'm not just another obsessed fan, I'm in love with you. It's not a joke, or a phase, it will never fade. It goes deeper than that. Leeloo199@aol.com
