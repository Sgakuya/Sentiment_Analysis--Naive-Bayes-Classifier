Quote - After churning out bad movie, after bad movie, she does deserve praise for at least having the courage to keep going in the business. What courage do you need to have in avoiding a regular 9-5 job like the rest of us when you could make money simply by running around in a bathing suit? Admit you have no talent, get out of the business, and try making it in the real world. That will show me some courage.
