CAUTION!!! I had assumed my 12 year old daughter could safely make a MIchelina Chili Mac entree. Shortly after she went into the kitchen I heard screams,ran to her, and found her crying while brushing hot food off her stomach - she was trying to remove the lid at the halfway point to stir the contents. One side had been difficult for her to peel off and it jerked causing the hot food to splatter out onto her shirt leaving 2nd degree burns. I will be contacting the company and just want to warn other parents about the potential danger.
