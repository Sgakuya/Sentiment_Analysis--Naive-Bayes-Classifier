I work for the airlines and Billybob was on our flight... What a GREAT GUY!! He was so gracious, polite, and charming and he could not have been nicer. We had a great time making fun of Pushing Tin , and he laughed with us and offered to send pics from the movie. He is DEFINATELY MISUNDERSTOOD in Hollywood. GREAT GUY!
