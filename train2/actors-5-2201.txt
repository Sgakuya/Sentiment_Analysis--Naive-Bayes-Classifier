When I first saw this guy in his Mork and Mindy incarnation I thought - WHAT an overly intense, scenery-chewing moron. Little did I realize that a few years later, when he ditched the drugs and sobered up at tad, he would become one of my favorite actors. No, he doesn't have the character range of Duvall or the looks of Gibson but, he can run the gamut from kind hearted and insanely funny projecting warmth, humor, rebellion, and good-natured idiocy as he goes. And, I wouldn't trade one of his phenomenal ad-libs for the output of a roomful of alleged comedy writers.
