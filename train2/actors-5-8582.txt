Natalie is my all-time favorite actress. She's one of the few who remained successful from the time she was a child all the way until her death. How could you NOT love her in Miracle on 34th Street, Splendor in the Grass (the best movie ever...), Rebel Without a Cause, West Side Story, and so many more? I wish she were still alive, but she will forever remain a legend.
