Martin Lawrence is a comical genius! Who in the world has the versatility the boldness and the distinctivness in is there comedic approach other than Martin? No one, Martin the television show is like the best show of all time (next to the Cosby show of course) Martin Lawrence is sooooo funny that he could have 64 year olds laughing as well as 3 year olds laughing it's that simple. For those of you who think Martin isn't funny you need to go and watch his T.V show in syndiction there is nothing out there more hillarious and original!
