Keegan has written a book from the common soldier's point of view, the poor-bloody-infantry life in harm's way. He is a masterful writer with a fine grasp of narrative, and he explains the terrors of battle in a very crisp manner. Using battles a few miles and several centuries apart (Agincourt, Waterloo, the Somme) he shows the terror and the workmanship of battle for the men in the line.
