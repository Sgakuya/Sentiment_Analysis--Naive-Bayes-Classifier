Seems like Tommy Lee Jones plays the exact same character in every movie (Fugitive, Men in Black, Double Jeopardy) - he's the smart, tough on the outside but soft on the inside guy who doesn't talk a lot and always seems to do the right thing in the end. But even though his roles are repetitive, Jones does an impressive job every time. Within his limited boundaries, he's a great actor and I enjoy his movies. It's also kind of interesting that he roomed with Al Gore when they were going to school at Harvard together. I wonder if they had a third roommate, and, if so, how that guy's ego takes it when the 25-year college reunion comes up... So Tommy Lee, what are you up to? Oh, I'm one of the most popular actors in Hollywood. OK. What about you Al, what are you doing? Running for President of the United States. I see. Well, I was just promoted to Junior Manager at AT T, and my boss says I have a great shot at becoming a Senior Manager in about a year or two!
