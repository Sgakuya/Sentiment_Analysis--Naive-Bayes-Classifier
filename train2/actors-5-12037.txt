I think that winona ryder is not one of but the number one best actress ever to step foot in hollywood. I have seen and enjoyed all of her movies. I'm only 13 years old and i admire her sooo much. I also think that she is the prettiest women on the face of the earth. I love her big brown eyes. The first movie i saw with her was mr. deeds and i loved it and i had to see more. I love her soo much and everything thing i said was true, and anybody who disagrees with me, or anyone who don't like her can screw! From Her number one fan, Becky Mercurio
