I wish I could of met Muhammad Ata and the boys and threw them a few extra bucks cause destroying the world trade center was not enough. To many shiit head people, rats and egos in that city. Makes me sick, it is a trash strewn ghetto. A city built with no alleys...nice keep the rats on the front lawn instead. Place is a shiit hole from hell.
