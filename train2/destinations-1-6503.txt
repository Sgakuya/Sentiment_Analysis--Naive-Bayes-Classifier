A state for the most past that still has the 'wild catter' oil digging mentality of the past. Perhaps ITS 'the culture'-if you want to call it that. I never enjoyed much about this state when I had visits and business in the early 1990's. Sprawling cities of numerous exurbs, traffic that was tedious, and pollution worse then California.
