I've heard people call him the James Stewart of our times. Without any disrespect to James Stewart (a lifelong favorite of mine), I have to disagree; Tom Hanks is the Tom Hanks of our times - and that's a very good thing. His now large body of work has been so amazingly varied and he brought a special something to each one of those roles. He has the ability to slip so easily into character that you are in a state of belief from the very beginning of the film. And, they are usually films you go away feeling very good about having spent your time and money to see. He s not on his way to becoming one of the classic great actors; he s already there.
