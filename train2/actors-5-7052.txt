I'm a huge fan! I've read many articles on Owen, and all say about the same of him: nice, funny and laid back. Which ,to me, is his approach to acting. People need to back off about his nose. He's fine with it and so are his fans. Anyway, I think he is hot the way he is. Whoever thinks his acting is off should give this guy a second chance. Owen is what you'd call an aquired taste for some( though I was hooked from day 1). I love his Texas drawl, smile and wry sense of humor. Sue me, I love the guy!!!--Stacy
