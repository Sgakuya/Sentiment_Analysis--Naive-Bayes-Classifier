 Gone With The Wind is a classic piece of literature that eloquently tells of a very poignant part of American history. By reading it, I felt an appreciation for the many hardships that the people of that time period had to endure. It explained and made real, the Civil War that tore our nation apart. It also gave a view of how the South depended upon slavery and whole heartedly felt it was not wrong, which is hard to believe but this book explains it well.
