Every time I have experienced an outage it has been atleast a week before I receive service and I have to complain and request to speak to 2 different bosses before I am prorated on my bill. Cox constantly fears the day that SBC is deregulated because thier monopoly will be over. (before you say some thing like "get dish then" I live in an APARTMENT! Cox pays off the apartment complexs to disallow dishs. Like I said. Monopoly.
