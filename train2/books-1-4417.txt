While the author describes the times well, his prose is lost on this novel without a compelling plot. I really did not care what happened to his characters. The narration was long-winded. The absence of a theme or message was also a problem. I like- or at least appreciated- his writing style, but I found Fitzgerald's writing to be as shallow as the time period he seems to criticize.
