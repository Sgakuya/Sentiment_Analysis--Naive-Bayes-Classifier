I thoroughly enjoyed White Oleander by Janet Fitch. It tells the story of a young girl (Astrid) thrown into the foster care system after her free-spirited mother (Ingrid) is sent to jail for murdering her ex-boyfriend. Astrid learns about life as she bounces from home to home, and she struggles to come to terms with her mother, flaws and all, through correspondence and occasional visits. The novel captured my attention immediately, and I had a hard time putting it down. The characters were very complex and realistic, and the plot took lots of interesting twists and turns. If you enjoy reading about mother-daughter relationships, this book is a must-read.
