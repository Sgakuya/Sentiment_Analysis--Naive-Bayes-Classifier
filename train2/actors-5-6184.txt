I've heard many mixed reviews about Crispin Hellion Glover but in my opinion I think he is absolutely wonderful. He is truly captivating. His style of acting and the emotion you can feel just looking in his eyes is amazing and scary at the same time, which I find most impressive. I would love to be able to work with him someday, it would be such a great honor. Crispin is irreplaceable. He's a fine gem and should not be taken for granted.
