Ok, so I can't stand the hype.Let's look at some of his movies: Amistad, Jurasic Park, The Indiana Jones series, ET, Shindler's list, Saving Private Ryan...they are all about good vs evil, adventures and special efects. Are they all made by a teenager??.... When he is serious he is very serious (you know, the holocaust... 2 movies about the holocaust!!!!....didn't we know who the bad people were to make the movie, on top of that, in black and white ....didn't we know the message prior to see it??). That's his complexity ...and in the rest just take away the fx and what's left: nice music (John Williams should be killed!!!), smart money-making story choices that people like. Where's the risk, the boldness???...
