Qwest sucks. I continue to receive bills 2 months after I cancelled service. The bill is for erroneous charges, for a service I never had, under a completely different name. They sent my bill (with erroneous charges) to collections after only 12 days, yet they claim that the false charges will take 6-8 weeks to clear up. Avoid qwerst like the plague. Scott
