Vile, lothesome, and icky in the extreme, Cher is truely one of the ugliest creatures the MooCow has ever seen. Her acting abilities are moooch over-hyped, and her mooosic (shudder!) is truely pain-inducing. She looks like a Frankenstein monster, with all her operations, and she is the poster child of Horrible, Tacky Bad Taste. Her cowstant quest for attention churns this cow's stomach, all 4 of 'em! Gross, horrific, yucky, bleachy - one simply runs out of adjectives to describe Cher's rancid foulness. :=8P
