Too be honest Austin is a good town, with a great quirky personality. I love the riverwalk in San Antonio. Dallas and Houston have energy. The rest of the state is a downer. Phoney smiles...How ya all doin! And then the knife goes in when your back is turned. Too many republicans, bible thumpers, intolerance, and redneck hicks. Also a poor envirionment- that seems to be blind to pollution and climatic change.
