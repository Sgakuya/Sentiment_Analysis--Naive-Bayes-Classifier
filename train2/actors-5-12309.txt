You all must be on dope or something. Halle Berry is gorgeous, and an excellent actress. She desearved her oscar. And just because she opened the doors for African American women, and she's biracial, she's still considered black, and white. she knows she's biracial, and the reason why she's opening the doors for black women is because no black women have ever won an oscar. She can't help it if she's both races. And she was racist she wouldn't like her own mother, who she looks up too the most. And she can claim black pride, because she obviously has some black blood in her (which is a good thing!) And if y'all think Jennifer Lopez is better than Halle Berry, think again, Jennifer Lopez is Still a great actrss and I ain't got nothing against her, but she's obsessed where she grew up, and she acts black, and she has NO black blood in her! Atleast Halle Berry has some. And who cares if she got a nose job, she wants to look good, i'm sure alot of sista's have got nose jobs. She just happens to be half white. And what's wrong with making a little bit more money if she shows off her body on the T.V? She goes after what she wants, don't we all? and she also enjoys what she does.
