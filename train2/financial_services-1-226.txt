We had an unauthorized checkcard debit on our acct which caused 3 overdraft fees by itself, took all our money. Then BOA made sure they send everything in that we had out there bouncing or returning every check. They wouldn't let us file a complaint, because we already had a refund on the way, but by the time that gets here, we were over $800 in the hole. The bank's attitude is very negative and unhelpful, they couldn't care less that it wasn't our fault. We will go to another bank immedietly. And this wasn't even the only time.
