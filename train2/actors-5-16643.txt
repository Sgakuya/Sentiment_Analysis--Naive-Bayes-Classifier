Kin Shriner's character of Scotty Baldwin has always been a favorite of mine. I have watched him on GH since his arrival. Loved his interactions with Genie Francis from the beginning to the end. He has always had a spark about him --- and one of the best ad-libbers ever on a soap. He just keeps getting better and better. Love you Scotty .
