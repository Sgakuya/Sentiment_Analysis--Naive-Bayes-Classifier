Had many problems with the Nokia color screen phones. Talked to useless customer service at San Jose store then refered me to the even more useless and rude Chris Carr! Said Nokia make bad phones too bad! I have to pay $25 plus tax for a refurb. phone I bought less than 2 weeks ago. Very bad coverage too! stay away!
