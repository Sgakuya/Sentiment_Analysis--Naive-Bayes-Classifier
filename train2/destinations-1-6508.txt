Austin is the only place that holds any kind of credibility in Texas. I am sure Houston and Dallas have a faint beat of civility-and San Antonio has a strong Latino influence. But most of this state is horrible. Crime, poor schools, envirionmental degredation, poor local services that add up to a state that cares nothing for people but nearly everything for profit and gross materialism.
