Jard Leto is one of the best actors out there today. For some reasons he seems to only get the bit parts. Ever since I watched My So Called Life and Jared portrayed Angela's love interest, Jordan Kedilano, I have been a fan. With tiny yet memorable rolls in film like A Thin Red Line, American Psycho and Fight Club he made his mark. Though each character Jared plays seems to get the short end of the stick or his ass completley kicked by his co stars. But he has proven he can hold his own since starring in the horrific and beautiful Requiem for a Dream where he played Harry, a drug addict who strives for a better life for all those he loves. A truely believable and heartbreaking performance that is forever etched into my mind. Jered is one of the most remarkble young actors in Hollywood and should be much more appriciated. I cannot wait for his next film which is intitled The Panic Room which is directed by the guy who made him get his ass kicked in Fight Club, David Fincher.
