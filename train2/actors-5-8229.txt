First of all, I am rating Crawford based soley on the "facts" I know. She was a marvelous actress, whom did have alot of depth. If you saw "a womans face" that's all that needs to be said, my favorite movie of hers bar none. She encompassed everything a true star was, Beauty, talent, loyalty to fans, determination, and good business sense. Now onto Christina. Have you ever thought she could have blown things out of proportion to sell a few books? Isnt it odd her two sisters werent even mentioned in the movie/book.Sisters to whom this day do not talk to her because of the things she said about Joan? Why treat just two children horribly, and not the other two? Doesnt make sense. And to write a book after someone is no longer able to refute the statements is tasteless. Joan's ex, Franchot tone stated the Joan in the book was not the Joan he loved and married. Many stars whom were friends with Joan claimed Christina was a horribly tempered girl, disrespectful, etc. Not exactly your victim personality type. I think she had a vendetta against her mother, as Joan made Christina work for her things, her career, or lack thereof. Christina wanted a career handed on a plate from her mother and her mothers connections, and Joan didn't do it. After all she came from nothing, and new what it meant to work for what you get in life. So I am judging the Joan I know to be true, all accusations aside...... The symbol of the Hollywood star, and Icon of Hollywoods Golden Era.
