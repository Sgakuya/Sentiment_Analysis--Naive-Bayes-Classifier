Go to Atlanta today and you'll see what 20,000 Confederates died trying to prevent. It should have been left in ashes 140 years ago. Over the last decade or so I have spent several weeks there at various technical workshops. After a day of classes you have to fight horrific traffic to go ANYWHERE. Once I woke up at 2:30 a.m. and turned on the televison. There had been a couple of accidents at critical points on the interstates. Traffic was snarled for miles and miles in all directions on almost all routes. THIS WAS AT AT 2:30 IN THE MORNING! Why anyone would want to go to Atlanta for anything is beyond me. The recent courthouse shootings further reinforce my opinions about Atlanta. It's quite obvious that law enforcement in Atlanta is completely incompetent. The criminals run the city, after all everytime a murderer, rapist,drug dealer, or street thug is put in prison the THE MAYOR GETS ONE LESS VOTE (or is that 10 less votes?)
