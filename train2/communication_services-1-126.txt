MCI has the worst customer service. I have recently switched, but in the time I had them, they lied about credits they would give me for fees they shouldn't have charged, information was inconsistent when I would talk to different employees, and they were usually very, very rude to me. There wasn't a bill I received that I didn't dispute in some way for incorrect charges. How the company has grown so large with such horrendous customer service is a mystery to me.
