One day while in college, some friends and I decided to make some martinis. None of us had ever had one, so we looked forward to it. I had some reservations because I had been reading a bartender's book, and it said that British martinis were wonderful and that American martinis were pretty much swill because we used a cheap liquor called vermouth to make them. After one swallow, all my friends and I were convinced that the book was right on the money. Martinis are a nasty drink.
