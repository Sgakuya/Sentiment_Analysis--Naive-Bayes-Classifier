Horrible..Phoenix will suck you in with nice comments. But once your enrolled it all stops..the instructors don't leave feedbacks..they don't even act like your there...and if you dont do the confusing work they require with no help..you'll fail.. Credits are worthless ..real colleges don't accept them.
