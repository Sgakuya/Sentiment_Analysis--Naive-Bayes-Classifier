I can honestly say that Edward Norton is an amazing actor, and he is by far my favorite. Don't get me wrong there are many good actors out there but there is just something about this guy that isn't even comparable. The first time I saw him was in a movie that I can't even remember but what I do remember was this guys talent to ACT!!!! In this particular movie, he was playing a mentally handicapped janitor for some place and he was secretly plotting to rob them. He did such a good, I just sat there and thought WOW this guy is AMAZING!!!! I have never been so partial to an actor but this guy has that something. He may not be a total hottie, but there is just something about him that makes him so loveable. If I see a movie advertised on tv or something I'm particularly interested in the movie, If I see that he is in it I will go and see it just for that reason. HE IS THAT GOOD!!!
