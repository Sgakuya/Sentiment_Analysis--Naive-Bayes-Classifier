Harley Davidson's SUCK. Over-priced oil leaking junkers owned by posers. No you are not cool because you won a Harley... all it show is that you paid twice as much for your motorcycle than you should have. They are unreliable, leak oil, and break down often. My honda VTX has almost twice the horsepower at half the cost and by the way it's made right here in America.
