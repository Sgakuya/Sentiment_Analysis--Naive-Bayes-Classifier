Been reading the strip for almost 3 years now. Between relating with the dog, although mine isn't a scottie, and the author/Big Daddy character, this has to be my favorite strip. A big guy in a comic strip who isn't a buffoon or slob? Whooda thunk it? Keep up the great work Chris! P.S. It's sad that so many of the 'one star' reviews seem to give their fave 5 stars and then dump on the rest, and wonder why this strip is so high on the ratings... Good strips are more than just laughs and giggles.
