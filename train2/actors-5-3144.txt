i think russel is one of the best actors iv'e eva seen and i don't really think he gets the credit he deserves. i was disgusted when i found out that tom hanks had won award for best actor AGAIN. i mean, yeah, he's a good actor but russel SO deserved that award for his performance in gladiator. no matter what people think, he is not some stuck-up bad boy, my friend knows him really well and i was so happy when i found out that he was a really nice guy, and this makes me even more mad. give him a chance!!!
