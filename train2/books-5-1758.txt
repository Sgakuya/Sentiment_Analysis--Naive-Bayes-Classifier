This is probably my favorite comic of all time. For one, it is constantly better that most of the stuff in the newspapers, both in humor and in quality of the strip. Also, I feel as if I can relate to the title characters. Another reason, is that said characters are foxes, which is my favorite animal. Finally, it adds a political touch, which is cool.
