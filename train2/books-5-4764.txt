Naked Lunch is a lyrical roller coaster ride. Burroughs, the avant-garde master of the Beat generation, paints a frightening but fascinatingly surreal landscape of addiction, paranoia, death, and sexual desire. Not only is it a joy to read, but it's a goldmine for anybody interested in queer analysis.
