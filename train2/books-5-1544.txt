With some of the elements that make up Calvin and Hobbes and Garfield, Foxtrot has had some truly great moments. One of my favorites is the one in which Jason's father is singing Burnin' Love in the shower, and Andy (the wife) tells Jason there's a switch down in the basement that says 'cold water shutoff.' and Jason says I thought you'd never ask. Foxtrot is pretty awesome.
