Crappy, clumsy attempt at an actor who's made a fortune glorifying violence. It's interesting that he's a rightwinger and his political bedfellows are always decrying the negative messages sent out by Hollywood, yet their boy Clint is perhaps the most noteworthy icon of mayhem worship in Tinseltown history. One of their own (include that other no-talent, Schwarzenegger, in this grouping, too) is a prime contributor to the problem they wring their hands over: just another example of conservative hypocrisy, folks. Eastwood has appeared in alot of worthless films and has directed/produced more than his share of clunkers. He appeals to people whose taste ends in their mouths. And he's a geriatric old fart already: he should have retired about 10 years ago. Go ahead, make my decade.
