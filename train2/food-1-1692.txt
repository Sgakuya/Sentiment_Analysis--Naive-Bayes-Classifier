ACK! How can the fourth-worst-candy-ever-created, and the worst candy listed on this site, have so many good ratings here?! Do Smarties have that large a following?! They're chalk with sugar, that's it! And all the colors taste identical, and that single flavor they do have is BAD. Almost as high a rating as SweeTarts... unbelievable! Makes me wonder how large a following the unlisted black-or-orange pseudo-peanut butter things given out at Halloween have....
