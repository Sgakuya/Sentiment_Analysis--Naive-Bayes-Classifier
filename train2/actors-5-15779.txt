Ted is a great actor who proved it time and again on both daytime,primetime, and movies.And while his character is complex and some of his actions may be questionable, he did amazing job in portraying dark, suave, intelligent,complicated, ruthless yet gentle and romantic man.His (as well as his character's)only problem is that on GH he happens to be the nemesis of one of the most overrated actors/characters I've ever seen.
