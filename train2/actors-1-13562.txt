If you watch a movie with Jennifer starring in it, it is usually a really good movie. But as for her character and acting on the show Friends, I really don't care for her at all. Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer are the most annoying people on that show. All they do is whine and carry on like babies. I realize the writers do this to them, but they sure seem to know how to annoy me when watching the show...it is almost like they are being themselves. But overall, I could do without Jennifer Aniston. And I get so tired of hearing guys saying how hot she is...come on now. There are so many other beautiful women on TV that can do circles around her....
