The WORST bank I have ever done business with. We had $$ in the bank and for a reason, that they could not explain, the $ was held. So we had a number of checks bounce due to Insufficient Funds ..However, the money was in the bank? They did not have a reason for this, were VERY RUDE and not willing to refund the $20 bucks a pop they charge for bounced checks. After much talking..they finally agreed to refund the money (after we mentioned notifying the Bank Commission.) Rude customer Service and ridiculous procedures. DO NOT BANK AT FLEET!!!
