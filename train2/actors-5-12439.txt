I first became familiar with Emma Thompson in Howard's End and Much Ado About Nothing...she is incredible! (I wish she would share more of her screenwriting talent with us.) I can't think of many other performers with her talent, personality, or wit. The only movie I didn't enjoy was The Judas Kiss. But, hey, not even Emma can win them all!
