She makes me smile. For two reasons. She's completely sexy and beautiful. AND, she's sweet and witty. She combines supermodel looks (without the anorexia) with the girl next door sweetness. She no doubt got her acting break based on her appearance, but she is developing nicely and we need more diversity in hollywood. If I see another gangly, skinny, shallow blonde I may throw up.
