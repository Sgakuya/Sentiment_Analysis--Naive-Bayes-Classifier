My hero since I was 10 years old. Everytime he'd unholster that .44 cannon in the Dirty Harry movies, you knew the bad guy was goin' to die! Guys like Clint and John Wayne, their movies you knew the good guy was going to win. They may get beat up, or put down for a little while, but they always come back, guns blazing! All American man if there ever was one.
