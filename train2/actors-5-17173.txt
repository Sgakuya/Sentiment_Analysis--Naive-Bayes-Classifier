Without her, I could only watch GH with half a heart because then I'd be left watching only for Maurice and I'm sure comparing every woman after, to Carly. It's not a stretch to say, every other woman for Sonny if there was no more Carly, would be found ...wanting. Tamara makes Carly real and GH is lucky to have found her! She's the perfect compliment to Maurice Benard's Sonny...the perfect fire to his ice! I heart her!!!
