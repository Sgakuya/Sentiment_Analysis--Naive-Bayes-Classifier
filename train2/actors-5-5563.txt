Honnesty, this is what he his. He is honnest when he acts, he seems genuine and seems so shy in real life. He feels on the big screen and you feel with him. His smile his one of his best features. He is a real Classical actor, I hope he will never take up a franchise role like James Bond, he is too talented for a part like that.
