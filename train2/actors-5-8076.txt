I would go six stars if possible.... Hepburn is THE star; there is no one like her or will there be. She worked with so many different actors and directors and was so very connected with the Hollywood elite and yet maintained her own self. She was the actress during the golden age of movies and continued beyond that into a time when movies and the theatre had changed dramatically, but without, hesitation, took both on with an enthusiasm unmatched by contemporary actors. Meryl Streep comes very close to her and may surpass her one day, but only because of the varied roles afforded her and the lack of quality acting that the contemporary world brings us. In addition to her acting, Hepburn had an extremely interesting life. Her life is somewhat of a timeline of social milestones. Those of you that are interested in finding out about this fascinating woman's life should consider reading her autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life and one written perhaps eight or so years ago, titled, Katherine Hepburn by Barbara Learning. Both books are excellent reads and recommend them to anyone interested in her, her times, film and theatre world, or social history. Enjoy!
