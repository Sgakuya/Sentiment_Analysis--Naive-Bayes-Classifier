Worst City in the World! Traffic is terrible, crime is in the top 3 in the country, people are the rudest I have ever met, and there is absolutely no culture to speak of. Then there is the worst part of it. Peachtree City, a town to the south, is 99.9% George Bush country and the people there are extremely snobby. Avoid Atlanta like the plague!
