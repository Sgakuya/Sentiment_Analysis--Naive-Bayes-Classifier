I LOVED this book. McCarthy's use of language is powerful and really swept me away. There were sentences that I read over and over because they were so beautful. I have yet to read the other two novels in The Border Trilogy (they are waiting on my shelf), but if they continue the experience I had with All The Pretty Horses, I will be thrilled.
