All Marlboro cigarettes are G-R-O-S-S. They have a unique taste that no other cigarettes have, the problem is... that taste is horrible. When you are through smoking one of these they leave a disguisting after taste in your mouth, comparable to ammonia and morning breath. The only Marlboro cigarette that is even close to good is Marlboro Menthol. If you want a good cigarette, go with Camel or Red Kamel.
