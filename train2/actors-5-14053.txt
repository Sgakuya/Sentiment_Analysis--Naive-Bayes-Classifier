Personally she is at the top of my list for most attractive actresses. Milla has a type of beauty which is unique. All too often people seem to have high standards of what is considered beauty. I think Milla's most attractive feature are her lips, which we got to see very well in The 5th Element. Her lips seem to have been sculpted by the hand of God himself for the sole purpose of kissing. As an actress she has not had the experience yet but she has potential and I expect she will impress many more people when her time arrives.
