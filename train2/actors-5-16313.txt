Maurice Sarah Brown are what attracted me back to GH after a 5 year absence....during the awful writing last year, he kept me viewing....Now to watch him with Tamara...HOT!HOT!HOT! Mo's intensity is awesome...every time I think he's nailed a performance and can't get any better, he just DOES! Sure could use another bubble bath with him tho! LOL
