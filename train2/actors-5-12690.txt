charlize theron is simply amazing. Especially in Devil's Advocate. Those who have watched this movie will understand what i mean. Some of her scenes are so strong that they are not likely to be forgotten. One is when she is out shopping with Diana Barzoon and Jackie Heath and another one is when she is in the church and finally when she commits suicide. She was also great in one of the recent movies Reindeer Games. The movie wasn't all that good but it was saved by Charlize Theron. She is very talanted and i look up to her.I have to mention that she also has a very high IQ for Hollywood. She is often compared to Marilyn Monroe. Of course many people might say that if the person is beautiful and smart that doesn't mean that he/she is a good actor. But let me argue on that one. First of all, it's Charlize Theron we are talking here and she is not just beautiful, she is BEAUTIFUL. And not smart, SMART. Besides, she has already proved her talent as an actress. and i'm sure there are a lot of people who are solidar with me. I give my strongest recomendations for Charlize Theron and you will no doubt enjoy movies featuring her as much as i did.
