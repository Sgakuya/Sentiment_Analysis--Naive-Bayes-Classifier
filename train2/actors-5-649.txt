Now here's one of my all-time heroes.I've been an enormous fan since first seeing a season of his films when i was 15.I expected some old boring ballroom-dancing fuddy-duddy;Some misconception!.He was enthralling,astounding,scintillating,so likeable, easy-going and graceful.I was enchanted.The screen itself seemed to melt.The years haven't dimmed his magic.Top Hat,The Band Wagon and Swing Time are 3 of the 5 best ever musicals.His solo routines are simply breathtaking,his elegance,his inventiveness and use of props unequalled.So many great and famous partners- Ginger Rogers, Cyd Charisse,Audrey Hepburn,Judy Garland,Rita Hayworth..and with all he was wonderful.Not the greatest voice,but he sure knew how to carry a tune;Irving Berlin,Cole Porter and Jerome Kern were all delighted by his timing and delivery of their songs.The ultimate perfectionist,who made it look so effortless.For once the old cliche is true,they really don't make them like that any more!
