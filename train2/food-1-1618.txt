There's no doubt in my mind that a single Jolly Rancher could be used quite effectively as a tool of torture. It is capable of choking a victim or cementing his/her teeth together indefinitely. If sucked in a certain way, a Jolly Rancher can also serve as a razor-sharp instrument of destruction. The various flavors are harsh enough to cause significant discomfort (especially green apple). Unless you're into self-punishment, avoid these nasty little devils!
