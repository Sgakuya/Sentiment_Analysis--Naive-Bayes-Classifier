I have lived here for two years and it is probably one of the worst cities in the world. Hoosier hospitality? Forget it. I am an outgoing person and have not met one nice person since I lived here. People are very closed and into their own little worlds. Traffic, for this size city is horrendous and it takes 30 minutes to drive around 6 miles in rush hour.... No good restaurants save for some lousy chains. Indy is chain restaurant capital of the world. Can't wait to move away from here.
