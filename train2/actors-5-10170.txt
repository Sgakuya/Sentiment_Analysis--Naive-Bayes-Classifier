She was born as Julie Smith.I am personal friends with some of her cousins in NJ at the shore area. I tease her cousin Marcia about an autograph picture she was to have gotten me.It has been three years and I have yet to get that picture.I met her parents at her Uncle Art's funeral 5 years ago.Julie is a superb actress.My favorite thing is a play she did.Checkov's Uncle Vonya. I may get to meet her yet one day.She was in The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and that is where I first saw her.She died in the greenhouse scene.Remember? Best wishes to Julianne if there is a way she'll see this.Pete in Perth Amboy,NJ
