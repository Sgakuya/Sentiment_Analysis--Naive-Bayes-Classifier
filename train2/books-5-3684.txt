This is a classic piece of anti-utopian literature. It is engrossing and disturbing. Anyone who wants to engage in intelligent political conversation should have this as a backgound. It is the origin of the terms Big Brother and Double Speak. The faint of heart should be warned, however. It has some disturbing torture scenes.
