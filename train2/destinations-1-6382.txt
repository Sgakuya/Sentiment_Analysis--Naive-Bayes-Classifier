Cheap place to live outside of Nashville. However the state is anything but progressive. Educational system is in the lower quarter of all states. Poor upkeep of state and interstate highways. Poor envirionment. Lots of poverty and ignorance. As in all southern states I heard negative hate spewed at African, hispanic Asian and gay americans and 'northerners and west coasters' as well. If this is a typical 'red state' then it shows you the type of people the republican party appeals to. Sad in a word.
