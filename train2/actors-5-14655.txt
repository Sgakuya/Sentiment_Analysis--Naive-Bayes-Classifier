I've only seen Couurtney in The People Vs which I thought she was fantastic in. Yes Courtney has a history of drug taking, but that made her performance realistic. Her past or what is going on at the moment shouldn't be lumped in with her acting abilities. She has good potential and I think she should be given credit with moving on with her life and not spiraling out after the death of her husband. Good luck to her.
