I was a huge Ramona fan as a kid, read and related to every single one of them. Ramona was an entertaining and hilarious tomboy who dealt with the daily ups and downs of all little girls (an older sister, parental struggles..being humiliated at lunch when all of the cool kids were cracking hard boiled eggs on their head and poor poor Ramona being horrified when she realized her mom had thrown in the wrong egg (raw, not hard boiled))..a great read for girls of her age as well as adults wishing to relive that wonderland of youth.
