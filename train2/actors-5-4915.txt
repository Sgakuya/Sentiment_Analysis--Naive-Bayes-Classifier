I think Matthew McConaughey is a excellent actor! he is very cute but that doesnt mean anything. He has worked so hard to get where he is now and he makes his own choice...it was his choice to play the bongo naked and it is his responsiblity to put up with the criticizem...but he shouldt because no one should criticize him in the first place. His hard work has paid off. He is very into his characters in movies and that is what makes him great.
