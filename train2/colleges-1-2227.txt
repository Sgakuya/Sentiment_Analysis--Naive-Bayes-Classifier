All this school has is basketball. I think that sports scholarships in general are a waste of money. You send someone to college based on their athletic ability instead of choosing people that work hard to make the grade and improve their minds,then you send the wrong message to our children. After reading LEGION1974's post,I went to www.angelfire.com/ky/pccsucks and all I have to say is, OH MY GOD. It seems that now The University of Kentucky is giving courses in breaking civil rights laws. Maybe one day they won't even exist to get a rating,but until then, they deserve worse than just terrible.
