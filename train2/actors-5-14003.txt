I love Julia soooooooooo much. I don't really understand people who don't. Some, okay, all of my friends tell me that I am obsessed with her. I think that she can act, but isn't the best because noone is. It isn't something you can totally judge and think that everyone will come up with the exact same rateing. But her personality is what really gets to me. I love the way she acts when not acting. Like when she is on David letterman or Rosie Odonell or Inside the actors studio. I really like her ideals and the way that she seems so selfless. Okay, enough idolising.
