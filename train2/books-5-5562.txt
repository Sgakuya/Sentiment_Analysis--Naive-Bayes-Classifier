Coetzee won the Booker prize for this novel set in South Africa, the only writer to date to do so. The man can write and has an amazing ability to drop you right into a life in the opening sentence, in this case a divorced professor who at 52 has managed to solve the problem of sex rather well. Not exactly... as it turns out. The title is appropriate for both the man and the country. Written in the present tense, situations are left unresolved and very much on one's mind at the end of the book.
