The first time I saw Andy Garcia was in the movie, When A Man Loves A Woman. That movie literally makes me cry everytime I've seen it no matter what. Anyways, he was really good in that movie as the caring, supportive husband to his alcoholic wife, Meg Ryan. Ever since then, I have seen him in other films (of course the names are escaping me right now) but he is a really good actor.
