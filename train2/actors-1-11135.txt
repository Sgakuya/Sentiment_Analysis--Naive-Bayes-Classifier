A limp and uninspiring attempt at an actress. Perhaps the most vastly overrated personage in Hollywood. Insipid-looking and totally lacking in sex appeal. Totally appalling in Eyes Wide Shut. She sucked so much in Moulin Rouge (which in itself, as a movie, was a bushel of roadapples) that I couldn't bring myself to see The Hours, although that fake nose would probably have improved her looks. I don't understand the appeal, outside of understanding that the collective taste and imagination of America is a dungheap.
