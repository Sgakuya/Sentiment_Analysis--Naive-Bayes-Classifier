I've only been there once, but I'm never going back. Yes, it is beautiful. No doubt about that. But the people are not friendly and they are very close-minded. I wouldn't call them racist, or anything like that, But they definitely stereotype anyone who isn't a native. You get a sense that they don't want you there. I didn't like that. OH! And by the way, Kar54...What makes you think that a diverse town is one that has to have crime ridden pockets of filth and is unsafe(as you said). You are exactly the kind of Utah resident I was talking about! You are completely ignorant,intolerant, and paranoid like half the other residents of this state! Do us all a favor and never move out of it!
