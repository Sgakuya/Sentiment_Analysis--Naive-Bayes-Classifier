I No that US cellular is BAD BUISNESS!! They won't give you and upgrade on your phone. And if you don't pay attention they will keep your deposit if you don't pay attention. If you in good standing with your bill and you put a depsit down, they should either credit it to your account or return it to you. They TRIED TO KEEP MY DEPOSiT. But through many,many ca;;s I finally recieved my check. There promo are SHADY!!! And they don't even have roll over minutes. Pay attention to your bill. They will cheat you!! And have the nerve to argue with you. They even tried to argue with me about when I signed up with them and I had a copy of the contract in my hand. The phones are Crappy (the free ones w/ promo) so they don't last long!! And that's the trick!! You will have to pay FULL price as if your not a vaule customer because they already have your buisness.
