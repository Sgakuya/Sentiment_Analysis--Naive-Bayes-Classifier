Socialism. Womb-to-tomb benefits. You can't give your child a swat on the rear end here if (s)he acts up in public, or you go to jail. Children's rights are placed ahead of adults. Living together without getting married. No strong church ties. What kinda screwed-up social mores does this place have, anyway?!? 'Nuff said.
