This book is the most erudite, comprehensive, gloriously readable work on the last five hundred years that one could hope for. For those of us who never took Western Civ (or were too young to truly appreciate it), this book fills in great gaps of knowledge. What a richer world this would be if educated people, and those hope to be educated, read it.
