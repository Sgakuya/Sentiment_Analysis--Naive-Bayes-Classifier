This is the worst bank I have ever had the experience to bank with. I used my debit card accoring to the balance that was listed at www.bankone.com. BIG MISTAKE. The online balance is always 2 to 3 days off and I used my credit/debit card for $2 and $3 dollar purchases and ENDED UP WITH $60 in charges. These scammers got rich off of me but hopefully it won't happen to you. Their customer service wouldn't even help me out. As reviews you may have seen, Bank One is the worst.
