Val Kilmer is the best actor for his generation. The first movie I saw of his was Willow , I loved it. I have seen and own almost all his movies, from his TV Movie debut One Too Many to movies where he only does a cameo like Pollock . I have seen him change and grow as an actor over the years. Val Kilmer is a fabulous actor, his talent speaks volumes not only is he a poet, an actor he can also sing(which I wish he would do more). Val Kilmer has a great sense of humour and timing, and he was very charismatic on the scene when needed such as Doc Holiday in Tombstone one of my favourite films. My all-time favourite that I could watch over and over again is Thunderheart I got so much out of watching that one. I hope that the Academy will begin to see what we his fans see. I look forward to seeing Salton Sea .
