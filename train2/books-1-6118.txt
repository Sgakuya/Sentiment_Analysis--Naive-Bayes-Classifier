Sadly, I read this book, and it had zero effect on me. Yes, I agree, it did point out many things about the fast food nation. Yet, I haven't died from eating fast food nor have I been diagnosed with salminila. How do we know all of his facts and opinions are full of truth? I mean, think about it, if you were a fast food coorporation, and you were vile, disgusting and uncouth, would you let someone come in and take a look that is planning to write a book about what he sees? No, of course not. So, personally, I think its just his opinion in which he's trying to change the way we eat. Didn't work
