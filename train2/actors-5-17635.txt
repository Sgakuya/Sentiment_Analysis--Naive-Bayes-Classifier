I love Erica Kane, she is the greatest; her wit, her attitude, her ambition. She is by far the best thing about All My Children. Susan Lucci portrays her perfectly. She is a wonderful actress and an even better real-life person, she is so passionate about the charities she supports, she is a truly wonderful person and we are all so glad she won that Emmy! Congratulations, Susan, you are #1!
