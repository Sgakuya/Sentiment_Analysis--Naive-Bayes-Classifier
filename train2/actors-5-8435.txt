My first sight of Marilyn Monroe was in the move, Some Like It Hot. In it, she was gorgeous, mysterious, sexy, a comedian, and overall, made the movie very delightful. Then I saw her in my second favorite Marilyn Monroe movie, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. It is now one of my favorite films of all time. She delivers her lines perfectly . . . from the light, airy sound of 'Scuse me a minute! to the low, comedic sound of Just a touch of laryngitis I guess. She was certainly an extraordinary actres . . . and more than that, she was an extraordinary person. Her charm, voice, style, and manner won over this country . . . even if they were not able to win Marilyn over in the end. She has such an amazing life, and if you all are interseted in the many details that made her so irresistible (from poor town to rich Hollywood) I reccomend a book, entitled Marilyn Monroe, by Barbara Leaming.
