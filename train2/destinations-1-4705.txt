All of the automobile tycoons of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who called Detroit home, would likely crap themselves, fall to the ground, begin babbling, have a stroke, and die in a miniute if they were to see Detroit today. Yes, Rockin Robin hood is correct, this place should deffinetly be used as learning material for other cities, so they know exactly what NOT to do. The saddest thing is the fact that it really did used to be a wonderfull city with great architecture, that you can barely see today behind the grafiti and police tape. Other older industrial like Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, maybe even Cleveland have a chance of returning to their former glory or better, but i believe Detroit has gone way to far, it can't be saved, and that's a shame. A damn shame. As for the suburbs, yes, they are nice, and have fairly friendly people.. But the they are responsible in part for the decline of the city. There are some friendly people in the suburban areas, which remind me a lot of where i'm from.
