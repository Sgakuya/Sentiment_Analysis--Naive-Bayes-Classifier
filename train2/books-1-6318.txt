Fair and Balanced? Very untrue. Bill O'Reilly crying and moaning about the liberal media. Heck, I'm a liberal and I don't run the television stations! In fact, I have no say in them. If I wanted Bill O'Reilly off the air (But I support free speech) I wouldn't be able to do so. And why is Bill always cruel to the black guests? I noticed he seems to be very rude towards guests that are black or Jewish. Do I sense a pattern? Bill lies about not being conservative. He says he did not vote republican, But it was shown on his voter form clearly he did! Also, He lies about where he came from!
