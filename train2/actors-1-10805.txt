 I was never impressed by Miss Hurley's acting abilities, and as I got to know her more about her, I wasn't impressed with her personality either. It's not just the infamous Marilyn Monroe comment, either, although that forever solidified Liz in my mind as a shallow, insecure brat. Insecure? Yes. Any woman who has made her fortune on her looks alone and still has to bash a dead sex symbol to feel better about herself is a pathetic case. It's also irresponsible for a celebrity to say something like - given how many impressionable young girls must look up to her and are probably suffering from anorexia, just like their idol. I hear all the time that Hurley is elegant and distinguished - PLEASE! Dumb americans are always eager to appoint anyone European as an ambassador of class and style and taste. Just because this lass sharpens her hip-bones and has an English accent doesn't make her any higher on the food chain than the hooker that was on Jerry Springer last night. Furthermore, I don't find Hurley attractive at all. She has masculine features, slack hips, an unimpressive bust (it's no wonder that rumour has it, she's going to do endorsement for padded gel-flled bras) - she simply looks mannish to me. I like luscious femininity- like Marilyn Monroe, for instance. Most likely Hurley is suffering from severe Marilyn envy -she probably knows that she hasn't the beauty, charisma, talent, or star-power to be remembered and well-loved like Marilyn. Years after Hurley's death, no one will write songs about her, books about her, produce countless biofilms on her. No one will remember who Hurley is in 40 years - except perhaps as that washed up old hag from Austin Powers. I'd kill myself if I were as talent-free as Liz Hurley.
