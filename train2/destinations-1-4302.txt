This city is wack now. It reminds me of the old south with the segregrated communities. And the police Department here act as if they are nazi's. I can't stand this city no more which is why I'm moving. So far I have been in atlanta visiting for months and I like it here better as a black man I have a chance to grow here I'm done with cali not mention atlanta have some fine ass black women there and they are a lot nicer.
