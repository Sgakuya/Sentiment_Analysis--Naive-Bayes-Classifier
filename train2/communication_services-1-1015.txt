From ordering to final cancellation, the service is more then terrible. Absolutely no quality control. They send me a pager with a frequency for California to Pennsylvania. Then they were wondering why it doesn't work. Their customer service reps are absolutely helpless and useless. The supervisors are not far behind. They don't care if you complain or care about their customers. Their standard answer is: I am sorry . Nobody knows what they are doing and they don't keep good records. Don't waste a dime or even penny on this useless company. The worst company I have ever dealt with.
