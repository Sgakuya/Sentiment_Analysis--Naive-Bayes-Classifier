Just last night(Feb 26) Nicolas just was honored and won a Cinemathaque award tribute!!! It was a great show. Nobody deserves it more. This guy can act in any kind of movie. He puts his soul into acting. Nicolas cage is a the best actor ever and a great person. I am looking forward to his upcoming films. Keep it up NIc!!
