God, this was an awful book. I had to read it last school year for a class assignment, and by the time I was halfway done with it, I was kicking myself for having chosen it. The characters were extremely boring with nothing unique about them, the plot was slow, and the book could have been a lot shorter if we hadn't had ten full chapters of Marry me! No! Marry me! No! from Tess and that Clare idiot. If you want to read a classic work of literature, please, pick somehting by George Orwell and spare yourself the sheer torture of this piece of trash. Take care, everyone!
