Upton Sinclair's The Jungle is not only gruesome, depressing and boring, but a huge piece of propaganda. If you enjoy meat, do not read this book. I myself am a vegatarian and this book made me sick. I couldn't even finish it because the vague story it did have ended 100 pages before the end of he book.
