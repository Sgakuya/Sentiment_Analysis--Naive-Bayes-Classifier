One of the greats. The man did close to a dozen truly fine films: Drunken Angel, The Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Stray Dog, Yojimbo, The Lower Depths, Ran, Kagamusha just to name a few. Great feel for cinematography and got the most out of his performers, especially that magnificent Toshiro Mifune. His movies are quite watchable to Western audiences, which indicates that cultural differences aren't an obstacle to The Great Master.
