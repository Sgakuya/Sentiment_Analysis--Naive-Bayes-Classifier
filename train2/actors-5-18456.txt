I love Steven Spielberg's work because he is so adept at creating these worlds that just take you in. He is the king of fantasy and happy endings and yet has a real, touching view with history in such masterpieces as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. He is truly one of America's most beloved and innovative directors.
