kia sportage is not good car. it may be good for it's class, but the whole class sucks. i mentioned in another comment that women buy cars because they are cute . this is a prime example of such a car. i usually only see women driving mini suvs or guys that don't know much about cars. this car in my opinion is not safe and to compare it to other unsafe cars is ridiculous. in a accident one the highway it will crumple like a soda can and all those safety features wont matter. most of those tests are not done at highway speeds. kia konnection, the car sucks. get over it.
