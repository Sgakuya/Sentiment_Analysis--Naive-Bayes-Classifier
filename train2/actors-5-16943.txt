Olga Sosnovska is an amazing actress. She gives so much into each scene. She doesn't even have to say a word, and you feel everything she is saying. She is beautiful, and her talent is being wasted on AMC. They need to realize that they have the best damn actress in the palm of their hands ... SO USE HER.
