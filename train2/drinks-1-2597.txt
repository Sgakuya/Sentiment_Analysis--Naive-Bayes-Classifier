What are you people comparing Dunkies cofee to? Folgers? Tasters Choice? Isn't there a decent local joint in your town that has good coffee? If not then go to Seattle and you'll see what real coffee is all about. I'm convinced the styrofoam cups that Dunkin Donuts uses cause brain damage making their customers think their coffee is good. Besides didn't most companies stop using styrofoam in the 80's?
