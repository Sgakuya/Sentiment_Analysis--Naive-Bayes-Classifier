GH really lucked out when they recast Chad Brannon to play Zander Smith. Only the most talented of actors could turn a 6 week guest spot into a 3 year contract. He's another Tony Geary but sadly the writesr and producers don't seem to realize the potential he has as don't give him the storylines he deserves. I paid little attention to bratty Emily before Chad Brannon but he brought out the best in Amber Tamblyn and took her from mediocre to good. I began paying attentino to her only after she was paired with Brannon. He brings out the best in everyone he acts with.
