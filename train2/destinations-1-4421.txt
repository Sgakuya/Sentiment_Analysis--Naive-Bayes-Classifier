Too bad you have to give a 1 and can't give a 0. Small town with delusions of grandeur. Sexist and unfriendly to women in business. Little if any support for the arts community - such as there is a community. Don't bother to go there unless you are a jock. Backwards, won't even change the times to keep even with the other states around it. Someone is trying to but the people are against it. Businesses haven't moved there because of this. Phoney town. The nickname from the 70's is the best - India-no-place. Worst public school system, unfair to blacks. Greedy white men have torn down much of the historic buildings - some under the cover of darkness against court orders.
