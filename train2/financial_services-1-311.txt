This bank does wha tit can to make the most from bouncing m,ultiple checks with pending money - bouncing multiple checks rather than one large check - holding large amounts of money for unheard of waiting periods etc... I am leaving this bank this week and can't wait to do so. Truly the worst bank I've ever dealt with. They are out for themselves only - they won't look out for you as a customer.
