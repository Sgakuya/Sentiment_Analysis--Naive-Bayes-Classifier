I thought this book had so much wisdom to impart. There was so much symbolism used to represent man and all of his characteristics. The Grand Iquistor story by one of the brothers, Ivan, is particularly astute in the lessons it attempts to give on the reader. Also, Fyodor Dostoevsky writes in a fairly simple manner considering the complex issues of life and religions that he touches upon.
