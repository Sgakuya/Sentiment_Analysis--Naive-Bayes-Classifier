I've heard people say that Russell Crowe is a modern day Richard Burton and in a way, it's true. He certainly resembles him and has much the same type of personality. But, he's a much better actor. In fact, I'd say he's in the top five list of best actors of all time. He's in the same category as people like Anthony Hopkins and Meryl Streep. It's just that not everyone has realized it yet. But, don't worry they will eventually.
