I just love this guy. He really makes the world a better place. He's a reason to stay alive. By the way, I love to see that he's finally playing a bad guy (One hour Photo, Death to Smoochy and Insomnia) I can't imagine that he's going to play in a thriller, because whatever he does, he's funny. I'm waiting for his new movies in which he'll be nominated for an Oscar. If not, he at least deserved another Oscar!
