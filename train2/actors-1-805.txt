Really dreadful. Only seemed better because he made so many films with that other no-talent, Skinose. Played essentially two roles, film after film: genial, happy-go-lucky ne'er do well or hipster priest. He did a very fine job in The Country Girl, which was about the only time in his career that he really attempted to act, to convey the impression of a character other than himself. The fact that this guy used to physically abuse his kids big time also doesn't endear him to me very much.
