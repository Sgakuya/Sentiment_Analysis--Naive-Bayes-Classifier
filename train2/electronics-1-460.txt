I also thought TiVo was the greatest invention until my unit failed (supposedly the hard drive). Try getting to talk to someone at Tivo in under 20 minutes. Good luck. Then cough up the $50 labor repair charge (plus shipping) to get it fixed. I have spent more time dealing with this damn thing. I am about to scrap it. No wonder TIVO stock went through the floor. I caution anyone about the TIVO service and reliability. It appears to be very poor.
