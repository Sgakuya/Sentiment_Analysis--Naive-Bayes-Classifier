Gillian Anderson continually amazes me, both with her performances as Dana Scully on The X-Files, and also with her movie work. If X-Files is your only exposure to this phenomenal actress, be sure to see her in The Mighty and Playing By Heart. And watch for House of Mirth, which should be coming to theaters soon, I hope!
