Clone Helen Hunt's stereotyped character so males worldwide can have a wife just like Paul did in Mad About You . She was perfect in that role, her character wan't perfect, didn't mind admitting it, and didn't hesitate in asking for forgiveness when she realized she had done something to hurt Paul. Hard to find a gal like that now-a-days. She looks awesome in jeans and a T-shirt too.
