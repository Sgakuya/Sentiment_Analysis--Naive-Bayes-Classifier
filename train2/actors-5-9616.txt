She's really a very capable actress, but is rather lax about the roles she selects. I have very high expectations from Chicago, her upcoming musical, as it is different, and more testing towards her capabilities. Those who say that she's bad, shouldn't forget The Mask Of Zorro, and Traffic. She was great in them!
