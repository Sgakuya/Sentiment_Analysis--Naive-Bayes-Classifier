Martin Sheen is an American citizen in the tradition of Thoreau. He is intelligent, informed, courageous nd sincere. How many of his detractors would be willing to go to jail to back up their condemnation of Sheen for exercising his constitutional right to freedom of political dissent? I don't see a line forming.
