No actor is above or next to Harrison Ford - as the true gentleman he is, he's always had his feet standing solidly on the ground, with an amazing gift to play any part as his natural best, with pure and plain talent - never even taking drama classes. His ability to play such diverse characters should have earned him several Acedemy Awards, fortunately there are still chances to come following his next films. Having admired his skills for years (as I first saw Raiders) and by following his work, 5 stars are least what he should be rated for in my view.
