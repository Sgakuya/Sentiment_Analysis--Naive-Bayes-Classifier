Mr. Spacey has a razor-sharp sense of humor, a confident sexiness, and is the quintessence of cooool. My favorite performances may not be in American Beauty or Usual Suspects or Glengarry Glen Ross (where I first noticed him 10 years ago) but his appearances on David Letterman. Mr. Versatility on a Zappy indeed!
