If Mr. Crowe were to read this site he would probably be amused, freaked out or think it was all bulls**t .The fact is ,however, that its all perfectly true.He is truly inspirational. Never before have I been so arrested by one person. His sheer passion and strength of character grab you by the balls and refuse to let go. It's as if the world is in black and white and he is in glorious technicolor! He so inspired me that I have changed my degree from Biology to Drama. He has a fire in him and I have been well and truly burnt by it. No bulls**t, Russell.
