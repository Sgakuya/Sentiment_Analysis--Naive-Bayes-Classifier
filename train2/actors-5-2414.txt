 Braveheart alone would be enough to earn Mel Gibson a 5-star rating. Not to mention the great Mad Max movies or the Lethal Weapon series. He's one of a handful of major actors who can pull off serious drama roles (you don't get much more serious than Hamlet ) as well as anchor big action movies (Bruce Willis and Harrison Ford are the only other two that come to mind). And in interviews Gibson comes off as a very down-to-earth guy with a good sense of humor. Somewhere I saw a home movie he made during the filming of one of the Lethal Weapon movies, and it was actually pretty funny. I've enjoyed almost every movie Gibson has made, and I'm looking forward to The Patriot.
