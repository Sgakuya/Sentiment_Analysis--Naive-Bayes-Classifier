The larger-than-life maverick genius whose originality and independent spirit were too much for Hollywood to contain.Even before his monumental debut film(aged 25),he'd already made a name for himself in the theatre,and with his legendary War of the Worlds radio broadcast which caused widespread panic and had them fleeing for the hills!With Citizen Kane,of course,he started at the summit;widely considered the world's greatest film,the A.F.I.#1,and routinely top of international polls.Its lighting,script,acting,camerawork,deep focus photography,compositions,overlapping dialogue,editing and structure are ALL exceptional.If it now seems inevitable he could only head downwards,the decline has been grossly exaggerated.The more intimate and lyrical Magnificent Ambersons would be every bit Kane's equal but for its horrible studio butchering.Touch of Evil is a great film noir .The Lady from Shanghai a brilliant enigmatic thriller,Chimes at Midnight and Othello highly imaginative low-budget reworkings of Shakespeare- the former a Spanish-Swiss co-production,the latter filmed in Morocco.If i am generally more an admirer than adoring fan,there's no denying his giant stature.We won't see his like again.
