Other fanbases can try to denegrate Ted King simply because they fear Ted's talent diminishes their actor, but it doesn't change the fact that Ted is an intelligent, handsome, generous and talented actor who epitomizes professionalism. Let me say such actions not only diminishes their fanbase and group, it reflects very poorly on the actor they supposedly support. Just thought I'd let you know what is going on, moderator.
