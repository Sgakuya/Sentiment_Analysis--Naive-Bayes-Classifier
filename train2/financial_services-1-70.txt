I checked and they will still only realse the 1st $100 of a deposit on the day your deposit. they hold the rest till the next day even though new bank laws allow them the verify the funds the same day they receive the checks. To find this out I was charged $2.00 for a non automated service charge They charge you to ask a qustion. This bank suck. the only rule they follow is more fees, more fees. Go join a credit union.
