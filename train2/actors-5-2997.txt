Sean Connery is outstanding and will always be number one in my book. I enjoy any and all characters he plays, not just because he is good looking and has a great voice, but because of his talent. I think he is best as James Bond, but I've enjoyed his other roles in The Untouchables and The Rock. In my opinion, he is the best Bond. Sure, I liked Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan, but something essential was missing. Who else but Connery as Bond could walk into a room and make everyone aware of his power without saying a word?
