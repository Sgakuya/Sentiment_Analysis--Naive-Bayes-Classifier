Matthew Perry is a great actor with so much talent! All of my friends agree: He is one of the funniest men in Hollywood! And who can resist that SMILE? I can't! Although, I have to say, his acting has become a little bit worse over the years, but he's still the same great Matt! Overall, who can resist an attractive, funny and talented man!!??
