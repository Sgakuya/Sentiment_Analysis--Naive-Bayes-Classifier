If there is nothing else said about this Prince Of Hollywood. It may be said that he made so many fine good quality films for families. That this alone should give him a 5.0. But he was one of my favorite actors. I do not know where to start. So here is just a few that I remember. The truly greatest family picture especially around the Holidays is Its A Wonderful LIfe. Mr. Smith Goes To Washington(Loved It), Destry Rides Again(Loved It), The Mortal Storm a picture about a breakup of a family in Europe because of Nazism. It came out in the 40s when the World was in chaos. It was important film as to the dangers and what and why we were fighting against(hatred of races)!!! Another *unique film* was called Rope, see it if you can. It takes place in one room all movie. It about the far Superior Mind and how warped it can get when murder is superiority's only reason. I'd keep going but since I have seen about 45 of his movies and never was rarely disappointed in the enjoyment of his movies. Since his death in the late 90s. Here's one fan who will truly miss him.
