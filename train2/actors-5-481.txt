I cannot believe some of the negative comments here about John Wayne. He was the most popular and charismatic star of all time. There's no doubt John Wayne was as impressive in his real life as he was on screen - read the comments made by people who actually knew him. There's a pattern - strong secure men and women loved him, but weak insecure types hated his guts. Most the pansies who knock him down on this site for not enlisting in WW2 would run a million miles at the sound of a single bullet, let alone enlist themselves. John Wayne was directly responsible for the enlistment of thousands of soldiers (and you'll never read of them criticizing him), and worked so hard after WW2 to support American troops everywhere. James Stewart himself knew the Wayne and loved him.
