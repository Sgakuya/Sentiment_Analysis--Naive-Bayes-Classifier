Sorry everybody, but his just didn't do it for me. Not only did I find her philosophy immoral but her writing really killed it for me. Maybe this is why I had trouble taking her seriously. I started reading this on the advice of my AP English teacher who said I would love this and I went in with high hopes of seeing life in a whole new way. I threw the book across the room at page 110 and declared her a terrible writer. Her characters are wooden and formulated, there is abysmal plot development and awful dialogue. I was very disappointed and even more so now because I wish I had the same experience other raters had. I guess this just goes to show how people can read the same book and come away with totally different experiences.
