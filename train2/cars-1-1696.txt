Bought ours 2 years ago from the Dealer.It is a 2000,and sees more Shop time than my 86 Reliant. Three Wheel Bearings(no Recall on our Model) in less than 135,000 Km's,Door Latches (Recall),Broken Front Coil Springs(Hidden Extended Warranty-only after they break!),Fuel Sending Unit(Hidden Extended Warranty),Broken EGR Tube(makes sound and run like crap). Now it will not go into 5th or Reverse(Standard). Like I said Dealer Purchase and also maintained! Found out that the Air Filter had not been maintained on it's regular Services,due to a seized Screw on the Air Filter Box.It always got the Green Light on the Maintenance Check! I had to use Vise-grips to take the Screw out. It had a 1/4 inch of Dirt in the bottom of the Box,the filter was plugged solid and there were a dozen Acorns in the Box aswell. We don't have any Oak Trees where we live or work!!!!! This caused the Maf sensor to be Faulty,which inturn made it run like Crap and gunked up the Throttle Body and Catalytic Converter. I have had Fords for 25 years ,but never again especially from Barrie Ford in Barrie Ontario,Canada. Cheer's Garth
