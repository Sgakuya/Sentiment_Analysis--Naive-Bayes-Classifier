Katherine is an incredible actress. Even if she protrays a guy in Young Americans, who cares?!? She does a good job of it. And she's so fun to watch, she has the best facial expressions. She's the reason I started watching Young Americans before it got cancelled. I wanted to see how well she acted as a guy, and every since the pilot, I've been hooked!
