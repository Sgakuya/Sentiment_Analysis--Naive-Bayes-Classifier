He sucks, He sucks. I do like that he spent a night sleeping on a park bench so that he could feel what it was like to be homeless. I wonder if that feeling stuck with him when he got back home to his million dollar mansion. I wonder if he brought any homeless people home with him. Typical dumbass wants to tell us how to live but would never live that way himself.
