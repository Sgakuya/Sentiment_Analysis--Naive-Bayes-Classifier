Hi everyone. I would like to share my story. About two hours ago I walked into US Bank and gave my manager my keys and told him to kiss my ass that I was quiting. I have worked for the bank for only about 6 months. I loved it at first, even traveling 290 miles a day to training classes for four weeks. I was in love with my job and my customers. I didn't agree with some things right off the bat. Like how a new customers paycheck is held for 5 business days before they have access to the funds. I had never heard of this before!!!But still I decided for the pay, I'd do it. Then came the sales. In my old bank we profiled the customers so we would be able to match them with the right product that best fit them. At USB we badgered each customer with whatever product we were required to sell that week. Customers had no names or faces, they were looked at as how much money they would make the bank. Either in overdrafts or buying product. I started hating the policies. Then came the days that if I got overtime by any amount my manager would physically cross it out on my timesheet saying we did not authorize ot. And of course the day that my bf was overdraft and called the branch on his cell in the middle of a restraunt and the manager said he did not have time to discuss the account. He turned to me and said the following Tell (my boyfriend) that he doesn't need to be an infant by hanging up on me. He needs to realize that its a bank. I don't have time to go over each customers account with them. I hate US Bank so much right now. I would rather take my degree and work at mcdonalds than ever give another minute of my time to this unethical company.
