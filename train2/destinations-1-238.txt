Of all the worlds cities I have visited - Manila is by far the worlds worst.. When I was there the traffic snarls were choked with dirt puffing Jeeps (minibuses) and the polution was so intense you could not see from one side of the road to another (in daytime). Add to that the fact that the poverty is not the pity inducing kind I have witnessed in South America and Africa - but agressive begging with no attempt to try and interact with the donor. Whilst I'm aware that as a western traveller my perspective may well be a bit skewed, I couls not adjust to the mindnumbing looks of HATRED from people on the street... My advice - give SE Asia a miss completely and head to South America - same grubby poverty - but people smile...
