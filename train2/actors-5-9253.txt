Very good actress! I would like to see more of these 'real looking' women in actress roles, after all, we have to watch homely, fat, bald men like Jack Nicolson in movies, so why not have real looking women. I just wonder at how many women of great acting talent there are out there who the execs in La La land pass by because they are not a size 2 with fake boobs and pretty?
