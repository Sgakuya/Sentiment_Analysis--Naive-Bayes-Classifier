If you want to feel out of control at highway speeds (assuming you can get up to highways speeds due to the lack of power), spend a lot of time at the pump, and experience rust in the first 12 months of ownership (something we haven't seen since the late 70's) AND HAVE THE DEALERSHIP TELL YOU WE KNOW THERE'S A RUST PROBLEM BUT WE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT then go buy an XTERRA. Otherwise, spend your money somewhere else. Disclosure: I own a white 2002 Xterra SE with 12k. Bought new 9/17/02 but won't own on 9/17/03.
