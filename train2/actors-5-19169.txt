Matthew Perry is one of the most hottest, funniest, loved actors in the world. I love all the movies he has made. I love Friends and his role in friends. I mainly watch that show because he's in it. He seems like a very kind and sweet person, and people r only looking at the bad side of him and always focusing on his drug addiction. I don't think that's fair. He should be treated like the great actor he is. I love Matthew perry, and hopefully I'll meet him one day.
