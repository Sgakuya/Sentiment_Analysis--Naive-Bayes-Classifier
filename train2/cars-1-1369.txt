what a piece of crap! I bought it new in 2001 a wolfsburg edition 1.8t. seemed fine till radio buttons fell off. then the brakes went had them replaced then rotors went with the brakes again. by this time the plastic interior was squeeking all over. Then a month later the rotors and brakes started grinding again. I traded this thing in for a dodge.
