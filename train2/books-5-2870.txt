Excellent book in that it pulls no punches, doesn't sugarcoat the American involvement in Vietnam, and puts into perspective just how unprepared our soldiers were when they were sent over there. This is one intense book, and its 400+ pages are almost entirely dedicated to the harrowing field action. You'll have a new appreciation for just what these soldiers went through after you read this. It's not for the faint of heart.
