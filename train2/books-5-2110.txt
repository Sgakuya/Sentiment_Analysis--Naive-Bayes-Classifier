Not a comic strip per se; it doesn't really belong here. Not Kurtzman and Elder's best work--for that, see the first 29 issues of MAD and (if you can find them) the two issues of Trump. But it was one of the very best-rendered strips in the history of the medium. Dark Horse issued a two-volume coolection some five years ago; volume one is the one to get; after about 1970 K&E seemed to run out of steam.
