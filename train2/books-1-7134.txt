Don't buy this, it's a waste of perfectly good trees! This series (at least the original trilogy) is a *complete* rip-off of Tolkien's _Lord_of_the_Rings_. The only things that have changed are the names and the exact wording (and of course Brooks comes nowhere near Tolkien's mastership in that area). I would have given it a 0 if there was that option!
