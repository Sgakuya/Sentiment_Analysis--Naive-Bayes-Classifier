The most horrible comic ever made. At first it may have been cute and even had some small amount of warm fuzzy humor attached to it. But now it has become the epitome of Uncreativity. Every third comic is Billy Draws the comic or that stupid line thing. It's a Bomb of Retardation that gets put into the Comics and should be wiped off of its pages for all time. I would give it less than one star if I could, but I can't so it remains at one.
