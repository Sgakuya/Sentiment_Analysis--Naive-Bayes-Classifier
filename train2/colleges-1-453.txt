I don't know when most people are going to wake up and actually say aloud or write in print that Edinburgh University is an absolutely atrocious institution, which it is. Perhaps too many souls have been stolen and are too removed. I hope not. Or I hope they can return, or be returned, I don't know. I have not experienced the business school so the mark is not for this but the whole place, which does offer good union facilities however though these are marred completely by the fact that they haven't opted to consider properly education so the unions are for weeping without showing and hiding and general disaffection from real life which is not the fault of the student. They are often like a chasm of nowhere. Few of the students I came across were into unions anyway, I wasn't and it wasn't that type of place, though we would have liked them should it have been real or appropriate. So most people found themselves pretending to be people going to unions who also wouldn't to - non-university students and the similarity in situation was more than remarkable. Who could handle that the wonderful apparent reputation of this place is nearly the total opposite of the truth? What is wrong with the government and other review bodies? Lecturers told me they didn't know where to look when they saw figures of the recent decades, and, to me also, perhaps the best I would be expected to describe is it's not very good, and that this, considering the truthful situation would be surprising even (not even that).
