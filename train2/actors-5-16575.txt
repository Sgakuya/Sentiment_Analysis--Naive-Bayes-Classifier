Paul Anthony Stewart is by far the best actor in daytime going at this time. He can play so may versatile emotions and he can cry on camera seemingly without any effort at all. He has the ability to play a bad seed with a good heart and make you fall in love with him. He has such sex appeal that leaves many of us wanting a man just like him to fall for. He is believeable even when given unrealistic story line which is rare in a soap actor. BTW Paul also also appeared in many prime-time and movie productins along with somme broadway too.
