Nobody is perfect - I mean, Tom Cruise must have had a bad movie or two. Don't hold it against Ashley that she was in Eye Of The Beholder. She takes leading roles well, such as Double Jeopardy and Someone Like You; and she backs others up well too: Where the Heart Is, Kiss the Girls. Take into account that and her good looks, and she is a great actress.
