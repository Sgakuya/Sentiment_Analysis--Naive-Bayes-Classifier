flat and with lots of wheat- middle America at is best or worse- depending on your point of view. Too republican, and out of touch with what is going on in the rest of the US. As far as comparing anything in Kansas with Boston- well that is sort of a stretch. And as far as costs are concerned- prices in New England are high because of demand- putting it simply this is a desireable place to live. Health care is pricey everywhere- but then again Kansas has voted republican in every election since 1944 except once (1964)Every major civilized nation on earth has 'affordable' or free healthcare- lets see where Kansas 'thinks' as a red state and where the blue states 'think' and why those blue states inhabit most of the top 20 states on this list. That says alot about its 'progressive' thinking. And by the way- evolution is a theory- and a theory is based on the scientific method- based on empirical fact gathering. Religion is in fact not based on facts- but based on the thoughts and interpetation of men-higly subjective- thats why you are in Kansas and I am in Connecticut.
