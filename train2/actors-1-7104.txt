Istill wonder why such a horrible movie as SIL got so many Oscrs. Both Paltrow and Fiennes were as awful as the movie itself. If you see or read one of great plays by Shakespeare,you will learn how stupid and superficial SIL was. Ithink this Fiennes will disappeare soon because he doesn't seem to have any talent or charm that would appeal to a wide audience. If only he were a little less ugly.
