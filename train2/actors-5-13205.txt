I LOVE SUSAN SARANDON!! I think that Natalie Portman was right...she is the model for how it works! Even though i am only 13, i can see what a great actress/person/role model she is for every person! My dream is to meet her! I am totally OBSESSED! The was she acts is just phenominal, it totally touches me and makes me laugh! One more thing, I wish that i look that good when i am 53! I can't believe all the people who don't think that she has talent! They must be on crack!
