Vivien Leigh was the most beautiful,talented actress ever to come out of England.She was definitely perfect for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind.It was very breathtaking and no one could have done it better.I don't think any stage actress ever did so well on the screen as Vivien did,and no other screen actress ever did so well on the stage...for this reason she was unique.
