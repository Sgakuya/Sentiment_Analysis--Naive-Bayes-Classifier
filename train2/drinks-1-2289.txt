This stuff is one of the most unpleasant bottled waters I have ever tried. I could not finish the small (8 oz?) bottle, and that's saying a lot (I'm pretty open-minded)! It did not taste like plastic, which sometimes happens when bottled water sits on the shelf, too long. Is it distilled? I hear the taste of distilled water is rather unappealing.
