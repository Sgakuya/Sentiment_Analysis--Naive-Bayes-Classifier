Gummy bears are just not fun, and isn't that the whole point of eating candy? They are hard to chew, they tatse gross, and once you manage to finally swallow them, bits of them are stuck in your teeth and you just can't get them out. How annoying! They may look cute, but I suggest you look at them all you want...just don't eat them. Any gummy candy is gross. And who's the genius that came up with gummy worms? It's just a disgusting concept.
