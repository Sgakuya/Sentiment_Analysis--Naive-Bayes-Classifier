Maurice Benard is an amazing actor! When he acts you can't take your eyes off the screen! He is so good at acting kind and caring with his girlfriends, wife and children and so ruthless with his enemies! I have been a fan since Maurice first joined General Hospital in 1993! I'm so happy he signed on for another four years! He is General Hospital!
