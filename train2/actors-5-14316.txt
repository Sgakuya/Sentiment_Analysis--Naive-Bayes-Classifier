Five stars are not enough for this beautiful and talented woman. She is sexy and extremely talented as an actress. She's just begininng to do more mainstream roles after first being on Friends early in her career. You can tell from interviews that she's smart, down to earth and has a good sense of humor. I bet she'd be great on a date or would be a wonderful girlfriend ( if she wasnt married) . I really like this chick a lot and would love to meet her in person.
