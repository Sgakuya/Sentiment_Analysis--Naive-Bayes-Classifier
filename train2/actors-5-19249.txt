Patrick Stewart was so good on Star Trek: TNG that many often overlook some of the other films that he has been in. Most notably, his performance in X-Men was great- I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Professor X- he was the perfect choice for the role. Let's not forget about his hilarious appearance on Robin Hood: Men in Tights and his exemplary job as the voice of Napolean in Animal Farm . A class act!
