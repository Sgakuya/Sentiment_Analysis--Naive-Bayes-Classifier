Ok Ok, I might get flamed for this but it is my opinion. The car is only great because of it's name. It's expensive, unreliable, and not a very pretty car. It's got steep lines, and harsh angles. It's a mean looking car.. brutish. It has power, but for the amount of money you spend on it you could have other exotic cars and still own a house, have a family and sleep knowing that you don't need three jobs to make payments. Personally I don't believe GREAT cars are the expensive rare cars... sales, reliability, useability(sp?), etc etc should all be factored in.
