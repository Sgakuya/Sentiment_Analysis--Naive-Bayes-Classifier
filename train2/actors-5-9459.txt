She's the best! I like Streep, but she's always the same. How can a person dislike Jodie? I don't understand it. She's so believable! And she has something in her brains. SHE HAS BRAINS! Which is something hard to find in Hollywood. Gwyneth is awful! Streep is always the same. Michelle is beautiful but she's always doing that kinds of roles from romantic comedies, just as Meg Ryan. So, I think Jodie is the best and the ONLY great one!
