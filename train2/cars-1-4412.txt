1996 Windstar with a 3.8L engine. At 73,000 miles, head gasket blow, oil mixes with anti-freeze. Ford's solution: install a short block. My cost ONLY $2066.00. Unfortunately I have driven a ford lately. While I will admit my local dealer did do some work with ford on the getting the repair bill to this price, when I buy a new car I expect the head gasket and for that matter the entire drive train to survive at least 150,000 - 200,000 miles
