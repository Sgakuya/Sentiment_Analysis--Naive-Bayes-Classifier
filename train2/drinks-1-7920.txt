I really enjoy my bourbon, I prefer Maker's Mark, and Woodford Reserve. I also enjoy Mcallan single malt scotch. Though I felt that I would try some Old Grand Dad, since a friend had offered it to me and his advice had always been reliable. Though I must say that the 86 proof is total garbage. It is the most heinous whiskey I have ever tasted and the finish on it left me with an I vomited in my mouth a little taste. I will, however, try the 100 proof, just to make sure that I am not leaving any stones unturned. Otherwise, if you are planning on purchasing a bottle of 86 proof, use it as a testament to what horrible whiskey tastes like.
