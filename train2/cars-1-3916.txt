Ive had a nice chuckle reading comments on this subject. Its fashionable to dislike these type of vehicles now sinse the war where we were made aware of possibly putting fuel dollars in the hands of the ememy. I think its a crock! Americans have always spent money where they shouldnt, we have always lived with status symbols bought with money, I cant believe that anybody would spend 10 grand on a watch! A freaking time piece!! (Rolex or any other) for exapmle......it is the American way, stupid or not. If people want to spend money on that, let em, the reason I would never buy one is because of the reputation they have because of whos buying most of them. I rarely see one that is not full of rapper type wanna be's. Whatever Cadillac did in the way they marketed these vehicles, this is the demographic buying these cars. 23-30 year old thugs! I dont want people to think Im being racial but Cadillacs were popular in my day with the black community and I always thought it was the basic need for them to improve there social status and in the 70's if you had a cadillac it meant somehing. I knew racist folks(a lot in my day) who would not buy one just for that reason. I do think that the young black community is giving themselves more of a black eye than ever in there image these days. The pance worn around there ankles showing off underwear, wearing womens hose on there heads, gold in the teeth where they dont need it, painting tatoos all over themselves that can hardly be seen, ebonics, etc..... its seems the more you look andsound like the ghetto, the more revered you can be? Whats missing here? You wont see me in one of these vehicles because I do not want to be lumped in with them. Plus I never liked Cadillacs!! They are for retired folks and gangstas.
