You don't have to be a big fan of comic books to appreciate the magnitude of ambition of Michael Chabon's Kavalier & Clay. Riveting characters, brilliant symbolism, and an engaging contrast between the hopelessness of the Jewish plight in the early 194o's and the limitlessness of the the comic book uber-Nazi fighter, The Escapist make for compelling reading. Chabon takes an immensely imaginative story and makes it better through the use of historical detail. An outstanding read.
