Looking back, I don't know if I've even seen Clark Gable in anything but Gone With the Wind. But that movie made such an impression on me when I was young that I can't even imagine him in any role but that of Rhett Butler. And although I only found him handsome about half the time, his film presence was so demanding that you couldn't help but look at and admire him. When I saw the newer sequel to GWTW, Scarlett I was wishing for the old Rhett back!
