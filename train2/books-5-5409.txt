Beautiful, sad bizarre, Geek Love belongs on film in the hands of David Lynch or Tim Burton. Katherine Dunn covers any weaknesses in the actual story with a wonderful gift of description. If you've ever had any interest in side-show freaks...then you are going to love this. The rest of you should also enjoy it, just not as much.
