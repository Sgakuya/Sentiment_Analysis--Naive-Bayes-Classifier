By far one of the best actresses of all time. Her acting is top of the line. I don't recall ever seeing any terrible movies that she starred in. I didnt care for Taxi Driver, but it wasn't necessarily because of her, as she was a great actress in that as well. All I can say is that she is wonderful.
