 Do the Right Thing remains the most powerful movie on race relations that I have ever seen, and I have enjoyed a number of his other films such as Son of Sam and He Got Game as well. Lee seems to do a really good job of capturing a mood - whether it be the sweltering, tension filled summer nights in Do the Right Thing, or the terror sweeping NY in Son of Sam. I also appreciate his ability to portray how confusing it can be to know who the bad guys are - in Do the Right Thing it would have been very easy for Lee to paint the Italian pizza shop owners as racist and deserving of anything that happened to them - Lee instead chose to portray everyone in this movie as painfully human - from the police, to Radio Raheem and Mookie, to the Italians.
