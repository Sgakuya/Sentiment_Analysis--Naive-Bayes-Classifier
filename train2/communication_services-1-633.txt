I live in Oregon. I have Cingular Wirelss service and have had to call Cingular 7 times and each time got angrier and angrier. First, I can no longer receive any phone calls. My CIngular service refers my calls to my AUTOMATED MESSAGE NUMBER AND THEN DOES NOT TELL ME WHEN I HAVE GOTTEN A CALL. CINGULAR TELLS ME THIS PROBLEM WILL BE RESOVLED IN 24 - 48 HOURS AND ONLY OREGON USERS ARE AFFECTED. WELL I HAVE NOT HAD MY SERVICE FIXED WITHIN 24-48 HOURS. I HAVE NOT HAD SERVICE FOR 9 DAYS. AND I CALLED THEM 7 TIMES. I HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY THEM TOO. WHEN I TRIED TO CANEL MY SERVICE THE WOMAN WHO WORKED IN CANELLATIONS TOLD ME BECAUSE I HAD A CONTRACT THAT I HAD TO KEEP THE SERVICE WHETHER IT WORKED OR NOT. THEN SHE TOLD ME THAT IF I PAY MORE AND UPGRADED MY PHONE SERVICE, THEN I COULD HAVE A SERVICE THAT WORKED. I WAS LIVID. I WILL NEVER EVER DEAL WITH SINGULAR AGAIN. AND IT HAS NOW BEEN 11 DAYS AND STILL MY SERVICE IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. IT DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO CALL CERTAIN NUMBERS AND STILL IS ACTING CRAZY. DO NOT USE CENGULAR. THEY ARE TERRIBLE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE. THANKS JACKI WARREN
