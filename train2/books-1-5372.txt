I find it deplorable that the author would say that God cursed the blacks through one of Noah's sons and that Oprah would recommend this book. Of course it is politically correct to paint the Baptist family with a brush full of hatred and thereby curse every other evangelical who would dare to spread the good news of Jesus Christ....the same gospel that changed by life and gave me the sure hope of eternal life in heaven instead of an eternity in Hell. Call it the Poisonwood Bible.....I call it plain poison.
