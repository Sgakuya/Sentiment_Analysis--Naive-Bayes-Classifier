Geez,what's going on here is so transperent it's not even funny.Antis seriously need to get a life-Lorenzo is fictional character, ya know? Anyhow, Ted is very talended actor who was wasted on S&C saga for months.Now that he's finally free, I hope he finally will get material to shine in. I happened to see him on stage once, and the guy can be terrific.
