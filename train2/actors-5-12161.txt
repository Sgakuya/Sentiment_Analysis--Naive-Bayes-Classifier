I have read a few comments that say that Katie is not much of an actor, but you must remember that she is still only a fairly new actor. Sure, she is not much of a character actor (yet) but that will come with time. An actor plays a character the way that they see it, so the character tends to take on much of the actor's own personality. She is well on the way to improving her career by taking on roles you wouldn't expect to see her in. Take The Gift for example, she plays a role that seems to degrade her image and is fairly believable (accent and all). You must take in to consideration that we all are used to seing Katie as Joey Potter and this tends to close our minds to the fact that she is an actor, not the character. If any of her supposed Joey character shines through, remember that this is KATIE shining through (just as ANY actor would shine through their character). I think that Katie herself would be very much like her Joey character, that is why she was cast in that role after all. She seems reserved, but very articulate. She could accomplish ANYTHING she puts her mind to, and given time, could become one of the best actors of her generation.
