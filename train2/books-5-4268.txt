I had to read this in the 8th grade. I was really not prepared to deal with all of the imagery in it and I think that affected the way I feel about it. I have read it since then and since visiting Dachau (one of the first death camps). It is almost indiscribable how much pain is contained within this short book, but everybody should read it, just to so we don't forget.
