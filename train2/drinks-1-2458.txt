Bigelow tea sucks!!! They don't know anything about making tea. What they do is come up with "chemical" flavors they purchased from Firmanich and they then market it as tea. They suck big time! don't waste your money instead try to find how you can get great tea elsewhere via friends from India, china etc who can stir you in the right direction.
