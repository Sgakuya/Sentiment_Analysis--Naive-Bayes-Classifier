Do you people actually know what you are writing about? 1 star given to outweigh these incorrect comments of pure rubbish. Look at this... an island bravely defended from invaders throughout the centuries, CastleBee * England isn't an island - never has been. Britain is the island's name! Don't hear about them much at the Olympics, Rusty * You never will - there isn't an England in the Olympics! It's the British team in the Olympics! I have been to many places, and Britain is really the worst of them all., SurrenderMonkey * This topic is about England - not Britain! The best places... the hills of the lake district Pennines and Scotland, lordfoulbowel * This topic is about England not Scotland! I think that some people need to realize that England has been the closest ally of the US since WW1, BIGBABY * No that's Britain! It wasn't just English people who died in 9/11. England has supported us in all ways ever since 9-11. Great country, Go Blair! BIGBABY * It's Britain that's supported you. Go Blair? Blair isn't even English! ANSGARD Scotland is not better actually. If you really are Italian you wouldn't even understand their accents. * Stereotypical rubbish - I assume everyone in England talks like David Beckham and has large tattoo's on their neck? We have digital TV and digital radio * And the rest of the world doesn't? Germany, France and Spain already had digital services a few years before. Sky is Murdoch's baby anyhow - an Australian.
