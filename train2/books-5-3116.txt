The most frightening King novel out there - and I've read a fair number. He writes his best when the books carry a message about human nature (e.g. Needful Things, Dolores Claiborne, The Grren Mile, The Long Walk, and The Stand) and what a message this one does carry. I'm shocked that the phrase pet sematary has not yet entered the English language as a commonly used phrase to mean anything that should stay buried and doesn't. If you can distance yourself from the cynicism enough, this book is a trip through hell. Perhaps sometimes dead IS better.
