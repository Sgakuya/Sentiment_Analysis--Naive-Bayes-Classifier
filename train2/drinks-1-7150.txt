Grey Goose is terrible. It's made from an unknown mix of grain (lowest of the low in term of vodka) and isn't smooth. For all you believers, taste it again against a truly smooth vodka like Chopin (from potatoes). Goose is made in France at an anise distillery -- they don't even own their own production facility. That's why it tastes like medicine. They actually rent out the distillery once a year to produce the stuff.
