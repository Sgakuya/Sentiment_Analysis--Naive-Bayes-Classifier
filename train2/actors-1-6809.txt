George Clooney only has one good movie...Ocean's Eleven, and he was not the reason the movie was good. He is also an extremely foolish and brash person, going so far as to make fun of Charlton Heston because the man in the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease. I am sure if a conservative actor like Bruce Willis made fun of Christopher Reeves because he is paralyzed, it would be front page in the media and he would be forced to issue a public apology. In a word...George Clooney is scum.
