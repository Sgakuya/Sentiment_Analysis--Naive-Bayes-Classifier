One of the best actors of all time. When you see his name on the Marquee, you know you are going to be entertained and entertained well. Never saw him play a bad role. I remember watching him as the really cool guy (Easy Reader, I think!) on the ELECTRIC COMPANY. He was cool then, and he is cool now.
