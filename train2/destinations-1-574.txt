San Juan is a beautiful city, but the Puerto Rican people are so lazy. They have no sense of civility. They throw trash right on the street and could not care less. They hate America and Americans, although most of them are on welfare. The beaches are great, but the people are of a mind set that is so unlike the American mindset.
