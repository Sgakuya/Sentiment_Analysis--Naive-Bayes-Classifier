I'm giving it a ONE because the new version of the celica looks like absolute feces. Now, the old celicas looked nice, but they were just Supra wannabes. It's only salvation is that it came from the same company (Toyota). The celicas are nothing compared to the Supras. Supras are top of the line, exotic supercars. Celicas are average sporty cars for average people. Supras are elite. The celicas are like the Supras deformed, runt twin brother, like Danny Devito in Twins . -solrac- soon 2 b mkiv tt 6 spd
