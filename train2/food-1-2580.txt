Really--please everyone tell me what you all see in this candy bar. I will never understand why this candy bar has always had such a large following. What is so terrific about little rice crunchy things? They're simply tasteless! All they add to the chocolate is a crunch. And this candy bar really ODs on the rice crunchies much more than Krackel does. Take that in consideration with the fact that Nestle's chocolate doesn't compare to Hershey's, and you get a candy bar I never care to eat again.
