Never read it, never heard of it, sounds like a nonChristian take on Jesus, so one star. *Update: Perhaps someone, anyone, might find my warning about this surely terrible book helpful if I point out that the listmaker described the book as being about a comparative study of the words of Jesus in the Bible and The Urantia Book. Now this is my point, nonChristian books about Jesus--at least on this list since it claims to be nonfiction--are in an adversarial position to Him, unlike a Christian book written by an author that has the indwelling Holy Spirit and revelation of Jesus Himself. Even, best case scenario, if this book was written by a Christian it's still going to be terrible, because there is no reasonable way to sort through the ball of twine of Urantic mumbojumbo crazy teaching that's at a minimum 1000 times wackier than Scientology and Mormonism combined. The Urantic Book says Jesus is an associate of ascending spirits, Planetary Prince of Urantia, and Christ Michael...but that's not even a 1000th of it...our world is Urantia, just one plante of universe Nebadon, which is part of Orvonton, one of 7 evolutionary superuniverses, etc. The book talks in dates of nearly 1 trillion years ago. The Urantia beliefs are so off the scale that major cult books like Kingdom of the Cults don't waste space on them. Waste of money, brains, or time.*
