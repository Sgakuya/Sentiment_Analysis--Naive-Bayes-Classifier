Annette Bening is one of the best, yet underrated actresses of our time. She gives outstanding performances in anything she does. Altough there are some of her movies that I didn't care for I can't knock her performance in any of them because they were all spectacular. Anyone that doubts her acting ability obviously either has never really seen her work or knows absolutely nothing about acting. She deserved her nomination and a win for her peformance in American Beauty. I am her number one fan and as an aspiring actress she is one of the only people in Hollywood worth emulating.
