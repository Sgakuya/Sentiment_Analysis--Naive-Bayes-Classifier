First time I tried to read it, I got lost trying to absorb all the information about the characters. Second time around I focused solely on the protagonist Yossarian. This is a genius piece of literature, drawing wry and ironical humor from a subject not usually associated with humor (War). You have to read it to truly appreciate the catch (no pun intended) phrase it coined.
