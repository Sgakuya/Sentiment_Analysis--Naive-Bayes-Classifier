This book should not be rated this low. It is great for what it is--a fun to read, accessible overview of U.S. History. It's the kind of book one can read on the beach or exercise bike and have fun while learning or relearning something. It would also be good for newcomers to the U.S. or for anyone cramming for a general history standardized test or for someone building a mental framework for more in-depth study. Highly recommend.
