I had a contract through Cellular One. They charged me for roaming calls that I never made. Then they accused me of letting one of my friends use my phones. All of my friends had there own phones. The bills tated that I made a call from another state, I wasn't even in another state that day. Needless to say, my bill was outragious and couldn't afford it. When my phone got turned off, they called all of my relatives asking them for money. They even called my sister-in-law, whom was married and had a different last name than me. They continued to harrass my family, until they threatened with taking them to court. They also called my parents on their cell phone, while on vacation and roaming EVEN after they told them to cease contacting them. How do they get all your families names and numbers? Wouldn't this be some kind of identity theft type issues? IF they found out all of your families names and phone numbers (yes even unlisted), how safe is your personal information!!!
