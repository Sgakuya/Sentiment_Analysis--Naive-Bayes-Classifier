I have always really enjoyed watching this man perform. He has an easy going, very natural style. I think the role that sums it up best for me was in Tucker a Man and His Dream . What a really wonderful, yet larely overlooked film. Bridges carried it off so well! He took this unfortunately very little known person, fleshed him out and made him so very human, likeable and someone worth rooting for.
