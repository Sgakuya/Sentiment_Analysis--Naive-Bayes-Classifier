She doesn't make the kinds of movies I would pay to see. Mostly her's are all boy meets girl in awkward situation, fall in love, out of love, then back in love again. I have never, ever, ever understood what part part of her is considered beautiful, or even pretty. She's funny looking if you ask me. Did you ever see the REAL Erin Brokovich? Now the real Erin is an absolute beauty - why in heaven's name did they pick Roberts to play the role? She's another one of those American phenomenon's that owes everything to her publicist, cause I don't know what else she got going on that generates appeal.
