NYC is the media capital of the world and nothing more. New Yorkers have an unwarranted arrogance and are largely filthy. Times square is tacky and queens, staten island, the bronx and much of Brooklyn is just depressing. NY pizza is crap!!! you hear me crap!!!. There is nothing Ny about its just pizza served with a topping of pomp.
