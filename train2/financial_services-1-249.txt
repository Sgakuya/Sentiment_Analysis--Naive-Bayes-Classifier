Bank of America is not a consumer oriented bank. First, they have a terrible amount of unforseen fees. Being a college student, I don't have much money and want a free account. They set me up with it, but I'm not allowed to see a teller or call the customer help line. If I do, it will cost me. So I'm stuck with the ATM and a debit card that hasn't come in, but I'm supposed to see the ATM for money. Since I don't have my card (the personal banker typed in the wrong adress) I go to the teller line to withdrawl cash. The teller informs me that it will cost me $2.oo to withdrawl cash. Worse than the ATM machine! She says with the type of account I have I am not allowed to see her. Talk about making me feel like I was back in the Jim-Crow days of the banking world.
