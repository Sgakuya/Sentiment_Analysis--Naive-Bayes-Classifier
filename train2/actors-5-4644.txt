My rating might be a little bit bias, because I think I am in love with Jim Carrey. But as an actor hes is if not the best then one of them. Obviously people love him he gets 20 million a movie! From his stand up days to his more mature movies Jim has made EVERY typr of person laugh! He is a true artist and not to mention a very attractive one! As a person he is cool with everyone and as an actor he is a true professional... I love the guy! Jess
