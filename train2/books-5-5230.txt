One of the best books I have read in a long, long time. It is clear that Garland has made huge strides from his debut novel, The Beach. While The Beach lurched from one chapter to the next, relying as much on shock value as Garland's writing ability to grab the reader, The Tesseract is a seamless, literary tour de force. Garland glides effortlessly across cultural, age, and gender perspectives to create three compelling, intertwined storylines - all of which are emotionally engaging. With such a stunning second novel, it would appear that Garland is on the path to greatness.
