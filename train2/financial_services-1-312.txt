Wachovia took over my bank and my Visa account. Although my Visa balance is high I always pay more than the minimum and immediately after getting the bill. I have NEVER been late and have been several thousand under the credit limit.Since January I paid down nearly $2K on the card. What did Wachovia do? They raised the rate on my ENTIRE BALANCE nearly 10%! ROBBERY. I complained and they dropped it back as long as I don't use the card. This is incredibly heavy handed tactics. I am closing my all accounts which used to provide a fairly consistant 2K balance for their use.
