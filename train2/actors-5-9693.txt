ahhh! i simply love her. she is my favourite actor of all time (well, i like kate hepburn too, but blanchett is my contemporary fav). first of all, she's gorgeous...and second, she's tremendously talented. i don't think anyone could've protrayed one of history's most important figures (queen elizabeth) more dramatically or poignantly than the fab cate blanchett. the brits certainly knew wut they were doing when they gave their academy award to her instead of the over-dramatic miss paltrow.
