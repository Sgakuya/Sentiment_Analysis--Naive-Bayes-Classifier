I grew up watching Tom Hanks and loved the vulnerability in his comic stylings. While Tom Hanks has built a career on playing the accessible every man type there is a lunacy especially in his earlier work that supplies a distinct energy to his performances. Who didn't buy the kid inside of him in Big ? With an open eyed, inquistive facial expression he delivered that character with ease. His mature work has just reinforced his range while preserving the qualities that we have come to expect from his characters; the honest, forthright, guy next door that we would hope would be around for us in a pinch.
