Heck yeah...This guy deserves his own show. Would really be nice to see a realistic program about Internal Affairs and the fine job they do. Scott Allan Campbell's character as Sgt. Martens on Blue certainly seems very realistic. Scott portrayal as an honest sincere and fair Internal Affairs investigator certainly seems VERY realistic. Come on, networks, give this fine actor a show that we ALL would enjoy
