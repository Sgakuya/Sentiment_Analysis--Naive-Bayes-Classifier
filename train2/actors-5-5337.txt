If everyone could get past the media induced frenzy over whether Robert Downey Jr. is clean or not, and focus in on the fact that this man has such talent it can't even be described. He has such range that you can love him and hate him all in one moment, he can take a heartless character and make you feel for him, he can play a lonely soul looking for the love of his life, or he can play tortured characters that are searching for the answer. I can't compare him to any other actor, years from now, people will look back and reflect of his talent, his torture as a human being, but it won't be forgotten the time, energy, and emotion that he put into his characters.
