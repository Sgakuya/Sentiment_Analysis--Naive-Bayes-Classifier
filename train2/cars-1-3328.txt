I will never buy another Chrysler product as long as I live (which may not be long if I keep driving my 99 Grand Cherokee). Nothing but problems since the day I bought it. Engine noise, multiple (4) failed power window motors - 2 of which I had to pay for, bad brake rotors, failed water pump (replacement only available through Chrysler for $135 plus labor), failed fuel pump (hard to start), driver seat losing shape, bad road noise, oil pressure problems. All of this with only $68K miles. If I wanted to make 2 car payments, I would have bought 2 cars. Instead I have a car payment and a Jeep Grand Cherokee corrective maintenance payment. This is precisely the reason Americans buy imports.
