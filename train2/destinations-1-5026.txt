The 53 counties of Upstate New York grew by a modest 1 percent and the largest Upstate cities suffered population drains: Buffalo lost 10.8 percent, Rochester 5.1 percent, Syracuse 10.1 percent, Albany 5.4 percent and Schenectady 5.7 percent. source is http://www.theithacajournal.com/communities/census2000/20010604/640912.html An analysis of population and migration data for the 52 counties of Upstate New York between 1980 and 2000 finds that:Upstate New York's population grew by a mere 1.1 percent in the 1990s, slower than the growth rate of every state but West Virginia and North Dakota. http://www.brookings.edu/es/urban/publications/200308_pendall.htm New York does have the highest taxes too; check it out http://www.taxfoundation.org/statelocal03.html As Upstaters, you realize a heck of a lot of our tax dollars don't go here.....they go to the pretensious bastards in nyc. we can never get a budget passed on time; we have the worst governor and two sorry senators who only care about downstate. Upstate is very nice as I lived in Syracuse. However, the economy sucks all over. Buffalo, Albany, Rochester, and Syracuse are losing population and jobs like crazy. Additionally, New York is probably the poorest run state, it can never pass a budget on time....plus the state is ruled by opportunists like Pataki and Clinton who could care less about regular people. The only success one can probably find here is if one wants to live and work in NYC; it's not my cup of tea but if you like disparity then there ya go. Don't get me wrong, I love big cities like Boston and Chicago but NYC is full of pretensious bastards. New York also has the highest taxes of any state in the country and the 2nd highest auto insurance rates. For the life of me, I cannot understand why NY is #4 on this list...........I'm sorry I didn't move out sooner
