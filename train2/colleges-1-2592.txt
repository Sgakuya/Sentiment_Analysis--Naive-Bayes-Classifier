Bates is dark and drury surrounded by a decaying mill city.It is 30 degrees from late October through mid April.It may think it is pretty special but in reality it is the armpit school of NESCAC.They have so many students suffering from depression and alcohol abuse that they use a May term to provide a recovery period.To be a Batesie and sacrifice four years of your life to reside in Lewiston, Maine is beyond pathetic.
