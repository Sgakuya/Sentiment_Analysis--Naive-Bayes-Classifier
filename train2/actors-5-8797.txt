Ok, anyone who thinks that Jennifer Garner is terrible is stupid! I have been obsessed with Jennifer Garner for over a year now & I have seen all of the ALIAS episodes 8 times each! There is no actress that deserves to win more than Jen does! She is amazing on ALIAS, Daredevil, & every show/movie she has ever been in. I don't knwo about you guys but I can't wait to see 13 Going On 30! Good Luck Jen!
