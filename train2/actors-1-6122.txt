One of the worst actors of the last two decades. Bull Durham and Field of Dreams had brilliant scripts and supporting casts, so he cannot be credited with their success. Suffers from the same psychosis that Mel Gibson does. I.e. He seems to turn out a lot of overblown, epic, vanity-project garbage. I heard he's a real dick in real life, too.
