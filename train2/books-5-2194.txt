I think it's a funny strip, and so what if it has Christian themes at times! There are plenty of secular comic strips out there for you anti-Christians to read. I agree with CastleBee. Liberals are so hypocritical at times. They fight for freedom of speech, but Heaven forbid some Christian wants to speak out...
