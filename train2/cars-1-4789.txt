I've had a 01 Edge for 10 monthes,bought it used from the dealer.50000 Kilometers and the clutch fried.3 year/60000 km waranty,bumper to bumper won't cover it.Along with the clutch in the last 3 monthes, the C.D.player died ,fan belt went, and a still unsuccessfully repaired buzzing on cold morns.I really wonder if the clutch is going to be an ongoing,expensive bi-anual repair.
