There a saucy sensuality to the women characters that is woefully lacking in most other comics. What is both intriguing and enticing is at the same time Pib possess a girlishness that makes her at once innocent and fresh; while Dru is Woman personified in that she is both strong and vulnerable and wise and scatterbrained all at the same time... What's not to love about these gamine characters. The insight into the feminine psyche shown by Mr. McEldowney is remarkable -- he truly makes them real. If taken individually the panels don't always stand on their own, but as an ensemble his stories sing with such an enticing melody you become quickly addicted. A book of all the strips would be both welcomed and acquired!
