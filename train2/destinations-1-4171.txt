Going to Alaska, I expected the scenery to be jaw dropping and Anchorage to be a jewel city. The scenery prediction proved true. But Anchorage was a big waste of space. Overrun with poor and unemployed people because they move to the city because they are paid by the government to live in Alaska. But because there are so few jobs in Alaska for unqualified bums, they sit around and live of inflated welfare checks. The city is a desolate and ugly eyesore in the Alaskan wilderness.
