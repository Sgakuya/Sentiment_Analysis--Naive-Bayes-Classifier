I feel very special as I have a picture of the 'Real' Duncan; I'm so glad Chris has chosen to continue the strip; Dunc is 100% a Scottie and the relationship with the C@T! is perfect. My husband prints out the daily strip and leaves it on my desk w/ my morning coffee! I love him for sharing it with me. K in NC
