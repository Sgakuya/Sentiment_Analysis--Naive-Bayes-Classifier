Hayley Joel Osment is a very talented actor. He was excellent in The Sixth Sense and just as awesome in Pay it Forward. He brings to each of his roles so much depth and range. I'll never forget his short, but memoriable apperance in Forrest Gump. I just hope that he doesn't fall victim to the Child Actor syndrome that so many of his comrades have fallen to in the past.
