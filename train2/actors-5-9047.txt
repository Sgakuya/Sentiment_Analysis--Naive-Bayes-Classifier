I have always admired Meryl Streep becasue she s a truly actress. Perhaps there are other actresses (Julia, Jodie, Michelle Pf, G Paltrow...) which are more popular than she is.This doesn t matter. Meryl has something they don t: a masterful talent. Also she is one of the few survivors from the Hollywood Industy.
