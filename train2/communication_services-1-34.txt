Anyone who rates sprint 1 obviously has not used Sprint Long distance for making every type of long distance call, this includes international calling. I was promised a rate of .54 cents a minute international calling, and was charged up to 24.00 a minute. If you are overcharged and they do not refund the charges, be sure to contact your state Public Utilities Commission. Put a stop to overcharging!!! Be proactive! Sprint is a disgrace to the telecomminications industry.
