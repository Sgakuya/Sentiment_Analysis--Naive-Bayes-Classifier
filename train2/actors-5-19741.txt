Kevin is a first rate actor who's come a long way! Not only was he a Perfect Hercules, but, his new show, from Star Trek's Gene Roddenberry,Andromeda, is becoming just as popular! Very good in emotional scenes, as well. He's very real, down to earth and you don't get that much in some of the actors today!
