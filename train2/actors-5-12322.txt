I have been a Halle fan since Boomerrang and I think that she is the best at what she does. i have allways looked up to her and think that she is a great role model and to reply to some of the comments I read i just want to say that I respect everyone's opion and for some one to say that she is a racist, and that she does not like white people, or how can she be 90% white and claim she is black? Well first of all in Halle's defense, for you to say those things you really don't know the Halle we know. If you have ever heard her speak or saw her act, you are sadly mistaken, she is a wonderful person. And she is not 90% white, she is half and half and is not at all a racist. Just because she recognizes her black heritage does not mean she is disclaiming her white heritage. I also thinks she is a great actress who is also intelligent and on top of that, yes, she is beautiful and we love her body including her breast, so if you are tired of looking at them, well, dont look!!! So, please stop hating on Halle!!!!! Love you Halle!!!
