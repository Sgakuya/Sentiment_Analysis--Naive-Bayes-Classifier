I find Mr. Hanks to be THE best actor of our time. He comes across as accessible to his fans and a genuinely nice guy. Unfortunately the actors and actresses of late tend to be a big dissapointment once having met them in person. Mr. Hanks, I believe, would be exactly what you expect. Kind, considerate and a true family man who does not compromise his ethics and morals. Keep up the good work!
