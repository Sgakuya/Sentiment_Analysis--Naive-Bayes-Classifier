I started at this school as an incoming freshman with very high expectations. However, my love for the school quickly vanished after about two months. In my critical tracking classes the professors would go far out of their way to fail you out of their class. I understand a university doesn't want unintelligent people to become the doctors and engineers of tomorrow, but this went beyond that theory and it seemed like a contest to see who could fail out more people. Obviously not all classes are like this but I got lucky enough to have two of my five classes like this. There is usually one good professor per course and freshman have basically no chance of getting them. Other than the bad professors (which I know is common to every university) the faculty and students have a very arrogant and pompous attitude since they think they are attending one of the premier universities in the US. UF is definitly a party school and while parties are fun don't go to a school simply for the "party" factor. Due to my bad experience here I transfered out. My best piece of advice for those interested in this school is DO NOT start off as an incoming freshman here, you will get eaten alive by the classes. Get your AA and transfer here and you will find it a much more enjoyable experience.
