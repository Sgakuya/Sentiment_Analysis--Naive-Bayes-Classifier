A tremendously gifted actor. Have followed his career over the years and his dramatic range is remarkable. Have never seen the West Wing but am not surprised that the critics and public rate him so highly. I have always admired his courage in speaking out for the causes he believes in and I believe it does take courage. Perhaps my range is pretty good too as although I support many of the causes Martin Sheen supports I also am a member of the NRA do not oppose hunting and am a member of the Audubon Society as well so sometimes easy labels do not fit. I think Mr. Sheen is great.
