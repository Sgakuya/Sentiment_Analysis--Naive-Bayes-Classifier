I have yet to find a page in Lolita that does not read like a poem. What a way with words he had. The mark of an excellent author is the ability to manipulate his readers in such a way that they grow to love a character as loathsome as Humbert Humbert. I actually sympathized with him, and I had been expecting to hate him, for he takes advantage of a pre-teen girl after ensuring the death of her mother! He is such a sociopath that he convinces me that he's an all right guy for a child molester. Now, whether it morally offends or not, H.H.'s likeability is proof of Nabokov's great talent.
