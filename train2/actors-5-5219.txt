I'm a teenager and love him! great actor, director and humanitarian. also very nice to look at! yum! ;) as fo all you rednecks, of course, i can see why you would have a problem with Robert Redford and all the other bleeding heart liberals out there. GET OVER YOURSELVES! there is more than one opinion out there, so don't bash others when their opinions don't match your own. and if you hate bleeding heart liberals so much, why are you wasting your free time posting hate messages on internet message boards? is envy driving you or are you merely stupid?
