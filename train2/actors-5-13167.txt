I'm disgusted to see Susan Sarandon TWENTY-SEVENTH on this list? reese Witherspoon higher then Susan? hahahaha. Reese may be cute and able to carry a movie,but Susan Sarandon is an ICON! She's brilliant, talented, and so down to earth. Her activism slowly and surely makes the world a better place. Not to mention, she's still as beautiful as she was in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.
