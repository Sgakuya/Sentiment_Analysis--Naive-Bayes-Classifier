i sent my employee to the bank this past tuesday for a change since we were low due to the long weekend. our change orders are not large therefore we do not have to call in a head of time. this si what BOA's employee said. sorry i can't give you any one's, you need to go inside (this was in the commercial drive up lane). my employee then goes inside. after waiting in line for 15 minutes she asked for one's the next employee said if i give you these one's i wont have any left. (we only needed $100 in ones mind you). my employee stated again that she needed them. the BOA employee had a fit and rudely thanked her for taking all of the one's. THIS IS A FREAKING BANK for christ sakes! we were their customer and all we wanted was $100 bucks in one's. all i can say is BOA will NEVER EVER be my choice for anyhting ever! this is just one of the many unplesant experiences there
