For your own sake, DO NOT PURCHASE A PHILIPS PRODUCT. I had a DVD player (cost-400+ dollars) and it quit playing my DVD's. It would play the old ones, but not the new ones. I contacted customer service and was lied to on two different occasions. They do not stand by their products. I contacted the Better Business Bureau, and even they couldn't help me with it. As if that wasn't enough, I had a t.v. of theirs go out within seven months of purchase, for no apparent reason. I used to be faithful to them, but they slapped me in the face for it, and I will not waste another single dime on them. Their business practices should be against the law. This is the United States, not communist Russia.
