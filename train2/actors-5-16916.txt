Olga Sosnovska is the only reason I continue to watch AMC. Aside from the fact that her beauty is breathtaking, she has a screen presence that is nothing short of amazing. Olga's expressions and gestures do more to convery her character's depth of emotions than any amount of words ever could. And that's a rarity, on any screen. I hope they realize what a talented actress they have before it's too late.
