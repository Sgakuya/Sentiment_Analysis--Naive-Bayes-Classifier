If her great acting has not been put to use recently, directors should start considering her again for some great roles. Olivia Hussey is a fine actress with a wonderful stage and screen presence. Even more remarkable is how she became such an icon at a fairly young age as the tragic Juliet Capulet in the 1968 film. She was immensely better at being Juliet than Claire Danes was in the updated, hip-version of the 1990s Shakespeare classic. Oh yeah, she's also gorgeous. Hollywood, give this talent a chance to shine again!!!
