I was told by the customer service representative that mail takes 7 to 10 days to process and that is why it took over 5 days to credit my credit card payment of $60. It almost seems like a way to earn some fee income ($15) with a late fee. When I called to complain (I have had this card for over 15 years and have never been late), the answer I received was the 7 to 10 days for mail. What year is it? 1810? I closed the account, which I am sure they could care less. Bye Bye Chase.
