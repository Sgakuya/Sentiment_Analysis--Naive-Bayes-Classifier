I honestly think Courtney Love is a great actress and a very intelligent person. The big outstanding question is whether or not she can play characters with personalities that differ greatly from her own. I don't think her character in 'The People vs. Larry Flint' was much of a stretch, and it looks like she's playing a very similar character in the new Andy Kaufmann movie.
