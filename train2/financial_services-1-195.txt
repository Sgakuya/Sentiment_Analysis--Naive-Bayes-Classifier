If at all I have ever given an opportunity to use my BIG MOUTH, then I'd say Bank of America is a BIG SCAM. The customer service is AWEFUL. I have a pending dispute since past 7 months and it has not been resolved. I have called them 96 times and everytime I request them to confirm any update I provide in the so called investigation, they have undertaken - I get none in response. Each and every customer rep. promises that they would call next day. But they are irresponsible. Folks do not go to so called Higher Standards.
