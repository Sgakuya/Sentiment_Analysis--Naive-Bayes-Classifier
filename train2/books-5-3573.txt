Flaubert's immortal tale of a married young woman who quickly tires of her worthy but dull doctor husband and seeks distractions from stultifying provincial life by over-spending and having extra-marital affairs.One of the undisputed classics of French and world literature,written with complete command of the language,perception and psychological depth.It is also an accessible read.(Incidentally,the one memorable film version is the idiosyncratic nonagenarian Manoel de Oliveira's wonderful but virtually unknown transposition to Portugal, Abraham Valley )
