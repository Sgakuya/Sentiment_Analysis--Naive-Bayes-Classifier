!!!!! WARNING - DANGER WILL ROBINSON !!!!! Beware of this camera. Even Sony does not believe in the reliability of this camera only giving it a 90-day warranty for labor (the most expensive part). They give a 1-year parts warranty, but mostly it's only labor that is needed. The parts are usually only a few dollars if even needed. I bought the camera in late 2001 and less than six months later, when I pulled it out to record my baby's first steps (the major reason we bought the camera was to record my daughter's milestones), it fails. And then they tell me that I have to pay $166.71 to have it fixed. Sony's gone downhill my friends, and I'd suggest that you look at other manufacturers. This camera was well-rated and feature rich, but if you have to pay $500 only to pay 1/3 of that again every six months, then you start looking elsewhere. ----- Amount Paid (US$): 500.00 Ease of Use: Good; all features are easy to learn and apply Durability: Poor; may get beat up; it will last a year Battery Life: Average; lasts 45-90 minutes Movie Quality: Excellent; professional quality
