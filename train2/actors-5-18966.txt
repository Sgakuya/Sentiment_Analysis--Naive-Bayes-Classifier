The very best (or least worst) investigative journalist america has to offer. Often misleading and opinionated, he stands up against any other media 'journalist' currently active. His films are personal documentaries and are thus full of his personal opinions. As for lying, I have yet to read a single fact-based proof of any intentional lies in his works.
