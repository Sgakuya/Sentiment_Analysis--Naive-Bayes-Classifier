Capital one are a bunch of thieves. I got a balance transfer from them at 5.9% until the balance was paid off. Eight months later without any notice my rate was jacked to 14.9% for NO reason what so ever! They said I received a notice,but they lied and you have no way to prove them wrong. I have paid at least $40.00 over the minimum payment. I have perfect credit and have never been late on any payment to anyone, that's how I got the 5.9 rate in the first place. The customer service people will lie to you and tell you that a supervisor is NOT in when you are actually talking to a supervisor. I would advise anyone who is holding a Capital one card to do whatever you have to do to get rid of it. Sooner or later they will screw you!!
