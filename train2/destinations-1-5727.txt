Hmmm where to start. I lived in Florida for 5 years and here is what I think. People are jerks, drive like jerks, and are down right stupid. Too many Rednecks, Cubans, and Mexicans. I lived all over the Tampa area. Went to all the theme parks, beaches, etc. It has to be one of the worst places I ever went. No jobs, HIGH crime rate...My car was broken into 2x's and i lived in a really nice part of Valrico. Whatever you do...visit..don't move there. it down right sucks. People suck, jobs suck, and the weather sucks. Too many people and tourists. Bugs are bad all year round. Try going to Georgia or North Carolina instead. Hell California is better then Florida.
