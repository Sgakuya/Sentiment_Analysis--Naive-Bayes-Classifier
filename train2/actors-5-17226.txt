Tamara Braun is doing a great job portraying Carly. She had a difficult task taking over a role vacated by another great and popular actress, and she has done wonderful job. Carly has always been my favorite female character on General Hospital, and that feeling remains the same thanks to Tamara's portrayal, and the drastic improvement in the writing. The longer she is in the role the more I am enjoying her portrayal.
