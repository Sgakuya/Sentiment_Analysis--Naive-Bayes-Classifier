I think that Robert DeNiro is a fantastic actor. His style of acting is original and there is no one like him. I read some of the negative comments on this website, and I feel that some people do not recognized outstanding performances when they see it. One comment was about the violent content in some of DeNiro's movies. I feel that the entertainment industry does not influence the behavior of an individual, it is the individual himself. A child who is raised with strong family values will have the ability to recognize what is right and wrong when he or she becomes older. If a viewer feels that it is too violent or too sexual, don't watch it! Another opinion was concerning the political background of DeNiro. Come on, this is suppose to be America! You have the right to vote for whoever or however you like. Second of all, we are rating DeNiro's acting ability, not politics.
