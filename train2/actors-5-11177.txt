Nicole is truly an amazing actress! The best I've ever seen! She's EXTREMELY talented and versatile. I've seen many of her films and she's been very good-if not brilliant-in every film. The only thing thats pulled her back in a couple of them was the poor film...or the poor part. Looking forward to all her new films that are coming up!! You'll get that Oscar girl ;) (She should have got one for Moulin Rouge!) ..To all those people who made remarks about Eyes Wide Shut....you obviously didnt understand the film. Obviously you're free to you own opinion. I'm not being rude-but those are just my thoughts.... And-no-it probably wasnt one of Kubrick's best-but i still think it was very good! She's also a stunning, stylish and generally lovely person...I.M.O :)
