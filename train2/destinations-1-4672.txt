i do not care for st louis at all.after growing up in los angeles, coming to st louis was a huge step backwards.The weather is horrible(not to mention how bad it is on people with allergies.And the people act like their brain dead and they drive like morons.Cant wait to move back to the west coast.The place has nothing to offer me.
