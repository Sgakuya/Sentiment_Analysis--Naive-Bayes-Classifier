My best friend owns a '88 5.0 and we agree to disagree on his money-pit. I drive a '68 Camaro SS that looks like the day it came off the lot. I just feel they're far too common for me. You can hardly spit without hitting one these days. He's got well over 10k in the engine alone so where does it end? You get stiffed on all your performance parts and yet I can do up my 350 for a fraction of the cost. I'll take character and classic looks over commonplace anyday
