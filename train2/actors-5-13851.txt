To be honest Julia Fiona Roberts who was born on October, 28th, 1967 in Smyrna, Georgia who has appeared in over 60 movies is my favorite actress of all time. She is funny, pretty , and a great actress.She has won Academy Awards for Pretty Woman , Erin Brockovich , and Steel Magnolias and much more. So to everyone who doesn't like her You all Suck and have no clue what you are talking about when you say you really don't like her, because she is great. I have bought almost every single movie that Julia Roberts has ever been in. All the movies that she is in are types of movies that you really get into and want to watch over and over again.I just cannot understand how anyone cannot like Julia Roberts because she is Great all together. Thank You!!
