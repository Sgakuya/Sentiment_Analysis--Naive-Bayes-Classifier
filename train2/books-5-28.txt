ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. I was hesitant to read it at first because I had pegged it as some typical rags-to-riches memoir but that certainly does it little justice nor is it entirely true. Frank McCourt is remarkable. His writing style is entertaining and refreshing. Although he writes about the most dire of situations, he is still able to maintain an uplifting and humorous tone throughtout the book. This is in part to his ability to regress into the mindset of a little boy who knows little of the ways of the world, except for what people have told him. All in all, this book is hilarious, endearing, and a must-read!
