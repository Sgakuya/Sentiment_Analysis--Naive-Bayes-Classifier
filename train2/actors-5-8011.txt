It is only fitting Audrey Hepburn played the angel, Hap, in her final role. Hepburn always brought an immaculate presence on the silver screen. And unlike today's crop of actors and actresses, Hepburn was beautiful inside and out. As in real life, her roles reflected an inner-beauty, always searching and hoping for the best in everyone. Who can deny she still brings a smile (and maybe a tear) to moviegoers who rightfully idolize her? In short, she was an angel.
