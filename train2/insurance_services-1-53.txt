Worst experience. I changed insurance companies after I turned 25. My premium increased every single year for 4 years. It even increased when I turned 21 and 25 years old even though I had no accidents or tickets. I called them when I was 25 and asked why my insurance progresively increased and they had no answer. The only thing Progressive about Progressive insurance is their rates. Have other friends who shared same experience.
