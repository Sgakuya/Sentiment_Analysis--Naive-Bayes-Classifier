Her elfin charm and grace,her appealing,kind,sprightly intelligence lit up many a fine film as few(if any)have done before or since.She made her name in the lovely Roman Holiday,an enchanting,vivacious princess to Gregory Peck's journalist.At times,in Funny Face,her romance with Fred Astaire melts the heart.What other pairing could have carried off such an age gap?Charade,a marvellous thriller,(also directed by Stanley Donen) again has you rooting for her and veteran Cary Grant,as they glide along the Seine by moonlight.Moments to treasure.And of course,My Fair Lady,The Nun's Story(a superior drama)and Breakfast at Tiffany's were all the more popular for her presence.From the sixties,she devoted much of her time to Unicef and other charitable work,but Steven Spielberg was still lovestruck enough(like others)to give her a part in Always,4 years before her death in 1993.She certainly won't be forgotten;stars that shine as brightly are in extremely short supply.
