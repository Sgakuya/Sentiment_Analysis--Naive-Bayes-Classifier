Amazing talent, nothing really to add after all the other kudos given, except to say that she is what I think of as a true actress, a craftswomen who knows her stuff, and that it is not about standing up with a ton of product in your hair and your bits hanging out looking uberglam all the time, or playing cute and funning but about making a character real and quirky. I loved her in Elizabeth and the Gift - she has one of those faces you just cannot take your eyes off. Go Aussie chick!
