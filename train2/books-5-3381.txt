Calvin and his crazy antics with Hobbes always remind me that it really is a magical world. They always do crazy stuff together like sledding down crazy snow covered slopes during the winter, and riding down hills in their cart throught the other seasons. The greatest thing about Calvin is that he always says exactly what he feels, and does what he wants. It's comforting to see someone actually being himself and seizing the hell out of every day.
