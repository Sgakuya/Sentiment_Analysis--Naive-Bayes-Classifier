Upon seing Russell for the first time in Gladiator I became an instant fan. I have since rented other films featuring him and they were all just as good! He is on of the best actors i have seen in a long time, he has the talent, the looks.....the lot. My dream would be to see him play in TOFOG here in England!!!
