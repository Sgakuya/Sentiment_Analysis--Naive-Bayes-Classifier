Like Gary Sinise, Gary Oldman is very underrated. But let the facts be clear about this. Oldman is a great actor, and I find it hard to believe he is not getting any lead roles nor getting any attention. Could it be because of his conservative leanings? Hmmm? In any case, Oldman is superb in any type of film genre. As the bad guy in 'The Fifth Element', or as Beethoven in 'Immortal Beloved', his acting range seems to have no limits. If anything, he should have top-billing.
