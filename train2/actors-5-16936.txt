It is a true shame that AMC has not taken complete advantage of Olga Sosnovska's talent. Being new to American daytime television, Ms. Sosnovska has has raised the bar for the other actors/actresses. She shows so much emotion not only in her voice but also in her facial expressions and also body language. I just hope that the writers will come to their senses and give her more screen time and extend her contract for another few years at least.
