i have every calvin and hobbes book. i love this comic. how a 6 year old is soarticulate but incredibly bad at evrything else makes it so incredible. it brings back memories of good times past. his little fantasies like spaceman spiff and tracer bullet make everyone instantly love this comic. how could you not with a cat who represents the philosopher thomas hobbes who hated all people much like hobbes except for the chicks!
