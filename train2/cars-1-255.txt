PURE JUNK!! I just bought a 2006 400 4x4 auto. The plastic fenders crack as soon as they rub against a tree. The 4WD busted on the second ride, the shaft actually slipped out of the front assembly because the brackets holding the assembly were manufactured 3/4" too high. Had to weld the shaft to the assembly and manually bend the brackets down to make it a fluid transition between 2 and 4wd. When it runs it's an animal, but too many bad habits for a $6000 machine. Should've bought a Kawasaki 360, would've been riding instead of welding!
