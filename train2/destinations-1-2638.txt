Chigago has a very attractive downtown.. and thats about it. Its a winter wasteland and can be quite nasty the other times of the year(too cold, too windy/stormy or too hot being its only settings). Lake Michigan is nice and actualy gets almost warm late summer but its pretty polluted unless you go on a major drive(Guess that river diversion didnt work after all.). The parks are ok but absolutely nothing special compaired to anywhere else and if it wasnt for a few optimist who build high, this would have been another Detroit.
