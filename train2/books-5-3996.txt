I was in a Virginia bookstore on vacation and didn't see anything interesting, but I saw this book on the shelf, so I thought, what the heck, I'll read it. I read it WITHOUT reading the foreward and introduction. It's more fun for me to try to GUESS what the symbolism means instead of having it explained beforehand. Anyway, I liked it. I laughed and chuckled quite a bit at this extremely clever political satire. I wish I could write something this clever and meaningful.
