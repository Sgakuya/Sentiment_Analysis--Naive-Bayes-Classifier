Besides the fact that this man is a phenomenal actor and an awesome impressionist (His Johnny Carson is FLAWLESS!), the one thing that strikes me the most about this guy is that mischeivious twinkle in his eye. For example, Se7en: Here is a psychotic madman who kills because he is dead- he speaks in monotone because he feels nothing! But look closer, you see that twinkle and it speaks books to the viewer. No matter what part Kevin disappears into, it's that twinkle that is indelible and irrepressible!
