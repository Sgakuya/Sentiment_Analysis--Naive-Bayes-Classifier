Haley Joel Osment is a great young actor, with lots of potential. He turned in a very convincing performance in the Sixth Sense, and I really enjoyed him in Pay It Forward as well. I hope he stays on track and doesn't fall victim to the Hollywood Child Star syndrome, like others before him. I also hope he continues making movies that show his full range of potential and allow him to expand onto new horizons as well.
