I love this comic most days. The story is about the daily life of a hypochondriac writer, Big Daddy and the organized & witty Adelle (Duncan and Brambley's "parents"), Duncan the Scottie and Brambley the cat (who is in love with Duncan). Anyone that is crazy in love with their pets as much as Big Daddy and Adelle are, can relate to the antics of this unusual family. I read other comics. Each comic strip has it's own theme and characters. I appreciate each for what the author has to say and to compare them to one another is ignorant.
