Runts were very imaginative, but they were a total failure. Wonka Candies has come out with some strange candies, but they have all turned out to be sucesses, except for these. Runts are candies in shapes of fruits, with the fruit's flavors. Unfourtuenly, the corn sryup in the candy takes the flavor away, and it's like your sucking on plastic.
