I thoroughly enjoy the book. It talks about a Black man place in this Racist society! I was not surprised that a lot of white people didn't like the book? Most white people are still stuck in the antebellum era! Oh! how can you say that? Look at all the Sports and Entertainment figures making money! That is the only arena that some Blacks are allowed to enter. Blacks need to wake-up and see that what is happening in Iraq is in correlation what Black people have experience in America. It is kinda of funny that white people have the audacious to try to speak,define,and know what Black people are thinking. You call that arrogance! Some people will say not all white people are like that. You must understand Black people, you are living in a white supremacy society. White people consciously or subconsciously still benefit from this society. I don't see large quantity of white people trying to level the playing field. Because it benefit them economically,politically,and socially.
