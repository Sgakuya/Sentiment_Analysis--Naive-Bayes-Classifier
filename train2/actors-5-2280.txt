A real man! Mel's not afraid of standing up for his faith, even if the majority of the world downgraded him. Anyone who has the guts to firmly say what they believe, regardless of what the politically correct may think about it, has my utmost respect and my constant cheers. God bless you Mel! If we never meet here on earth, someday we'll meet in Heaven.
