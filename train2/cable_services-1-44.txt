Constant problems on the bill (by "constant" i mean every single bill for the last 8 months), intentionally difficult to reach a customer service rep on the phone, "faster speed tier" is a f***ing rip off (125kb per second is the fastest ive ever seen, yet I have no firewall or router), etc. To hell with CONcast. F***ing monoply.
