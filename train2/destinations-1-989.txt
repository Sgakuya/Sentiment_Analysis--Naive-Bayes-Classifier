English people are not polite at all. They're hateful, rude and obnoxious. They're xenophobic. You know, at international soccer tournaments, there can be trouble, and it is almost always the English fans who cause it. English people are also boisterous and disliked on holidays, where gangs of them travel to foreign countries (esp. Spain) and cause trouble. The English humour is very hurtful - MEANT to offend. English people tend to WANT to upset you.
