A great biography of one of the greatest generals in American and world history. It is an insightful and thoughtful coverge of this contraversial figure. From his birth at a frontier outpost during the later portions of the Indian Wars through his training at West Point, service in World War I and World War II, his dismissal from command of the troops in Korea and his later years, this book will kepp you interested. A definite page turner and quite a good read.
