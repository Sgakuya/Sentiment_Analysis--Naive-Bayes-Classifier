I'm not exactly sure why this book is so timeless, but it is. Bolles has compassion for the job seeker, and that comes through on every page of the book. He stresses things which are common to every job search - discipline, self-confidence, preparation - and does it in a way that is neither patronizing or obtuse. What Color is Your Parachute is one of those classics - A Catcher in the Rye of reference books, if you will.
