We have a 2004 Buick Rendevous for 8 months now. We have had nothing but problems. We bought the car new. We could be going 60 mph and the car would just shut off. We think it is some kind of electrial problem. This has happened several times. We brought it back to dealer and they can not find the problem. We are now going though the channels of lemon law.
