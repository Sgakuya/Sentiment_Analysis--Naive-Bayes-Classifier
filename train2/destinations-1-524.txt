I agree with the other poster that the constant badgering from the locals ruins the whole place. Its like getting attacked by 2000 gnats whenever you walk outside. Also we were in the town of Montego Bay shopping and 3 men in their 20's started to talk to some of the people in our group (a group of like 8) - they were playing some scam where they would ask one person what hotel they were in and the other one would go to another member of the party and say arent you staying at the xyz hotel? After we cought on we tried walking away from them and one of them said - Give me your money or your life - i.e. we are going to kill you. We ran away into a taxi and went back to the hotel. Regardless to say I will never set foot on that hell hole of an island ever again. There are many other islands in the caribbean that you can go to and be completely safe (i.e. Anguilla).
