It bothers me today how actors and actresses are judged more for their sexuality and beauty rather than their inner qualities and their ability to act. Actresses like Audrey Hepburn not only epitmomize good acting, but also are the closest examples of what a human being should be. Her inner radiance shone like a beacon of light to our inner souls, and when she passes on, we realize that something is missing from the world...Audrey.
