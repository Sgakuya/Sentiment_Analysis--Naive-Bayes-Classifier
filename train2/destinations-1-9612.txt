Barf. I tried the clove thing for a couple of months in high school, but I was tired of feeling nauseated all the time and I wasn't a goth kid anyway. As far as positives, the buzz is unmatched. The first clove I ever had wigged me out in such a pleasantly trippy way that I thought for sure I would never go back to a regular cigarette ever again. Going out to the smoke shop to buy cloves was akin to a pilgrimmage to Mecca...you would've thought we were going to pick up a check for a million dollars. But if I had more than two in an evening I spent the rest of the night thinking I was going to puke my guts out....I would actually need one or two normal cigarettes to cleanse my palette. It got to the point that now I can't even stand the smell of them. Plus, the smell was so strong I couldn't hide them from my parents. There was only one brand of cloves I could handle, but I can't even remember what brand they were....and I don't really care anyway.
