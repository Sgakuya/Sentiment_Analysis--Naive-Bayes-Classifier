I was in Lafayette for about 6 months, as well as Bloomington a few years back- Frankly I have have never been in a place with such ignorant hicks in my life (outside the deep south) The people are dumb, backwards and homophobic. If you are a female or male for that matter and not married by 25 -you are marked. Boring place, mostly crappy chain stores and eateries. Lacks culture. If you move here from the northeast or west coast, be prepared to be shocked. KKK very active as well- very republican. Low cost living- but its cheapo for reasons.
