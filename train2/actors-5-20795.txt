I think Sarah is a great actress, I too feel that she has her homily days as well as beautiful days, but don't we all!!! Come on get real she's human too!!! Sex in the city is great show and just keeps us in stitches!!!!! As far as the politics - blah, blah, blah, blah, blah who cares!!! She won't be able to change a thing and neither will you!
