My parents are stranded in NC on their way to TX to visit us. Their new F-350 6.0 L truck just broke down *again* last week. At 800 miles it broke down with the oil in the gas problem and they waited for a week to get the truck fixed. Now at 2500 miles, it started the not running at stoplight problem and eventually stopped working again and is once again at the shop. It *again* has the oil in the gas problem! The Dealer doesn't know how to fix the problem and says Ford doesn't either. They have spoken to some customer rep on a hotline and that has been no help. The Tech rep for the region cannot be reached. The dealer believes all the injectors need to be replaced and after reviewing various technician reports on the internet I agree. However, FORD won't let them! Its one at a time and so what if the customer is inconvenienced.
