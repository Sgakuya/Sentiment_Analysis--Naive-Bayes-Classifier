Mel Gibson is more REAL then some can handle, and most of the reasons anyone says neg against him is they are threatened by his masculinity. Or his talent. Beyond his out of this world eyes and butt there is a very talented charming man. He is an ACTOR and that does not mean each character is Mel Gibson... actors get paid for you to believe that is them.. if you believe he has done his job.. isnt there enough reality in life? Escape to a movie with Mel tonight... dont forget the popcorn. http://www.sillyone.com/Mel
