Harvey Keitel deserves a much better ranking in this poll than he currently has. After watching his mezmerizing performances in such films as The Bad Lieutenant , Reservoir Dogs , The Last Temptation of Christ , and Copland , I can't understand why typecast, one dimensional actors like Patrick Stewart are ranked higher. F*ckin' Trekkie geeks!
