The Viper is a one trick pony. Yes, it's fast off the dime but is that enough to justify it's pricetag and it's accompanying trade-offs merely for raw power (i.e. poor gas mileage and harsh ride)? It's all a matter of balance and the Viper can get tiresome. This isn't a car built to drive on winding and twisty roads, it's trump card is on the drag strip that's all.
