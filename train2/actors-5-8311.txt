Not only was she an extremely beautiful actress she possessed amazing talent. Her portrayal as Scarlett was pure magic no wonder why Selznick took one look at her and said i found my Scarlett. She is my idol when it comes to acting and i would have to say her greatest performance was not that of Scarlett but of Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire she was a legend of unparallel portions. She was a star even among the stars
