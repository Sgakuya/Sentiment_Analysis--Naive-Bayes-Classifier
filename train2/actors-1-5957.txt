I just don't get it. I am not jealous but I do not think he is a handsome man. No, I am not jealous. I happen to think Nicolas Cage and Bruce Willis are decent looking. No, I am not gay either thankyou very much. It's just that the man truly looks like a rodent. And last I knew, rodents have no acting talent. I will be the first to admit, Tom Cruise has been in some good movies but if Nicolas Cage or John Malkovich or somebody of some degree of caliber were in any of Cruise's movies, these flicks would be even better.
