It's like a disease for which there isn't any cure. I was sold the service to have communication during the course of a long, driving, fishing trip. Bottom line, I was told I'd have coverage and I didn't. When I was finally able to call to cancel the service I was told I couldn't without penalty. I can't get rid of them and they continue to cause problems, the last of which is a charge for 121 minutes of operator assistance which a service person with an attitude told me I'd better pay, although I wasn't given any explanation for a call I didn't make. It's been a total frustration, and there isn't anyone I can contact that can give me any suggestions other than to pay a $200 penalty and walk away from T-Mobile in much the same way a person would leave an open cesspool.
