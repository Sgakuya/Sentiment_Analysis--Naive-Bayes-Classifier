Reese Witherspoon is by far the best actress going right now. Even when Reese does a cheesy teen flick, her acting comes out superb and she always outshines the whole movie itself. She certainly deserves to be in movies that would win her Oscars. She is way too talented for some of the stuff she has been given lately. I loved her in Legally Blonde,and I am sure she is just as good in part 2. ELECTION was just a great movie period. I don't think it would have been anything without her however. But her best movie to date other than Cruel Intentions was FREEWAY. FREEWAY is a must see for all die hard Reese fans, and just regular fans alike. It is what truly made her a star. Keep up the good work Reese. I HIGHLY recommend her movies to all adults.
