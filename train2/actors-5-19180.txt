i think he is so sweet and funny. i love him on friends and i can't wait for chandlers and monica's wedding. it will be so great. i love his laugh it is so adorable. i mean HE IS ADORABLE AS WELL! he seems genuine like he would do anything for you if you were in need. he puts me a lot in mind of christian slater with his actions. they both are hotties and always will be. my favorite movies of his is fools rush in and three to tango. i have them both on tape. i love how he does physical comedy because that seems very hard to do like in the whole nine yards when he ran in that sliding glass door. i mean that had to hurt because it looked so real. i hope he continues to make great films! blair
