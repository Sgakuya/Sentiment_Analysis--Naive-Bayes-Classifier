Tom Hanks is probably the most obscenely overrated actor living today. He basically plays the exact same character in every movie, with the same voice, mannerisms, and personality. The exception is Forrest Gump, which was the most overrated performance of his very overrated career. If you can sit through an old episode of Bosom Buddies and still think of Tom Hanks as brilliant then you are severly mentally ill.
