One of the greatest movie directors of the classic era. Best known for 'Rebel Without A Cause', which made James Dean's career, later cut short by his tragic death. His best movie may have been 'In A Lonely Place', the darkly realistic story of an alcoholic scriptwriter (played by Humphrey Bogart) suspected of murder. Nick Ray ranks with Wells, Hitchcock and Scorcese as one of the great directors of all time.
