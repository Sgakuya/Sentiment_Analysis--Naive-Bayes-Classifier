I became quite obsessed with her after seeing the movie 'Sweethearts' in which she starred. And she is fantastic. I love everything about her-her sarcastic wit/humor, the way she laughs, how she does NOT look like those anorexic type girls in hollywood, her pessimism. I just love her, and I think she is beautiful.
