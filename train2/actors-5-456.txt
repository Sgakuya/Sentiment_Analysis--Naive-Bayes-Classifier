Sadly, I have only seen Gene Kelly in one movie, and that was Singin' In The Rain, which is probably one of the best movies ever made. However, I did get a good feel for what kind of character Gene Kelly portrayed and I adore the guy! He can sing, dance, act, and look fantastic, all at the same time. Sometimes I wish that we still had truly talented actors like Gene Kelly to look up to.
