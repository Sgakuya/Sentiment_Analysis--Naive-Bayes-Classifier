Voltaire is an excellent author. He is wonderful in that he is one of the few authors of the time (18th century France) that satirized the optimism of the time. He was extremely pessimistic and follows the tribulations of Candide throughout his life and his great misfortunes. He meets a person that is a symbol of the optimists and he shows the clash in philosophies between the two sides. I would highly recommend Candide to any reader from 8th grade through adults.
