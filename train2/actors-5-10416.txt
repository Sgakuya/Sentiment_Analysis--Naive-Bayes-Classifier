I think Kate is the most beautiful and talented actress in film today. She makes daring choices and isn't afraid of appealing to mass audiences. While the films Holy Smoke and Quills are certainly controversial Kate's performances have been award worthy. She is an actress who isn't afraid to show her body and doesn't feel the need to have the figure of an anorexic model. I hope she makes many more films in the years to come.
