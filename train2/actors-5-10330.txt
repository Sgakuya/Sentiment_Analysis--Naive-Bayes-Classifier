To watch Swank's potrayal of Brandon Teena is to shed tears for someone who seemed to be a lovely person who just didn't know where to fit in but didn't compromise herself either. I saw the documentary The Teena Brandon Story and when watching Boys Don't Cry it's hard to distinguish where Hilary Swank begins and where Brandon Teena ends. I hope to see her in so much more. After watching BDC , I have every assurance this actress could play anything!
