Why is a Lexus only one star? Because this latest incarnation of the ES 300 is retro styling at it's absolute worst! What were Lexus's stylists thinking? Yea, this car drives excellent as any Lexus. And it has Lexus's superlative fit and finish but, the damn thing looks like a baby hippo on wheels. I thought we were through with the horrible jellybean round feminine styling of cars. Think early Nissan Altima, Ford Taurus and early to mid 90's Toyota Camry and I forgot to add that awful first generation of Toyota Avalons. I hope this design is a sales failure. What was once a clean masculine, compact excellent design has deteriorated to this?
