Cate Blanchett scares me whenever shes on the big screen, because she has really devilish looking eyes. Her characters are extremly strange, and her scripts are usually cut paper thin, and shes usually dropped from the whole storyline once you get into the movie. I guess the director couldn't stand the pain of watching her act.
