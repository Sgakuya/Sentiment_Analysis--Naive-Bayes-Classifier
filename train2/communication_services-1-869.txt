My husband had clearnet and when telus bought it he became a telus client. He got me a cell phone also fromclearnet which is totally useless, bad reception and too expensive. Now after having 4 years with them, they want to take away the services my husband has. he pays over $350 a month, and now they want him to pay more for his existing plan. I have never heard this before in my life for a corporation to change the contract they signed. Is this legal? I am so uch asking my self if we are in civilised country with rules and regulations to follow. The worst phone company tht is there in the universe. If u read this mail before purchasing their phones, helpyourself by not getting it. It is not worth the hassell & misery they put u thru
