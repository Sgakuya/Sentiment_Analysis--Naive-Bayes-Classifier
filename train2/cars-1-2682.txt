Combining Ford's notorious lack of reliability with a further lack of the one good American car builder still in the business, Carrol Shelby, means that this car is an over priced mediocre car. Sure it posts numbers to match a Z06, but at ten grand more. Sure that power comes stock, but what does that matter when $1300 for an 83 RX-7 and $10,000 for a four rotor puts me well over 750 WHEEL horsepower. Its simple, for American power just about everything after 1971 is a beater. If you want new, buy Japanese. If you want American power, buy a 68 Chevelle SS.
