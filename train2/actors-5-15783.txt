PBear - To answer your question, the Ted King hate stems from the misfortune of being cast as the interloper between General Hospitals destiny couple Sonny (Maurice Benard) and Carly (Tamara Braun), and being Sonny's nemesis. I think Ted King is a good actor. I also think that he has done an excellent job with some questionable material, and his performance makes me believe his character although I dont always like or agree with the characters actions. To me that is the mark of a good actor. I think he is a great actor with a lot of range, and that has been displayed in his previous daytime roles on Loving and The City, as well as his numerous prime time starring roles and guest appearances.
