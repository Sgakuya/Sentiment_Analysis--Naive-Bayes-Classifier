I don't usually leave comments, but in this case, I HAD to. I realize its all a matter of one's own opinion, but how can anyone say that Julianne is overrated?!!! She has great range, does a variety of blockbuster and independent movies, and never appears to have let her fame go to her head. She seems to really choose most of her roles(not just for the money, like some do)! So, in MY opinion, she is underrated!
