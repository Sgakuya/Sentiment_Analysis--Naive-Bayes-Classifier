Diane Keaton is someone who can capture anybody's heart. It's not only through her acting but every bit of her. When I watch her, I always feel that there's always something 'more' to the character she's playing - she's got that inner beauty that surely radiates. (she's also got the physical beauty anybody would admire) Diane Keaton is simply the best!
