Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors on screen today. His charcters are believable and engaging. He has proved himself capable of tremendous range. I find an amazing truthfulness to every character I have ever seen him play. His style is guttsy, and his choices are unqiue. I would see a any film that he was in.
