He really needs to retire. Mr. Mumbles has passed his expiration date. Too bad Maurice cannot play any other character other than Sonny Corinthos or we might actually get his one-note self OFF of General Hospital. Since he has nowhere else to go and no other network would put up with his ego, I guess GH will be stuck with him until their ratings hit rock bottom!
