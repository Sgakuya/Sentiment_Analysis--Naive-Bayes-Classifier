Calista Flockhart is awesome! She is great and a wonderful actress. People ought to leave her alone about her body. It is cruel the way people make comments about her surrounding her weight. It is not anorexia nervosa that she has to deal with; it is all the ignorant people who keep putting her down... to bring themselves up. Calista is definitley a wonderful person and actress. She gets my full support and admiration. I am sad her show is no longer on.
