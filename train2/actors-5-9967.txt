I've only seen her in 'Muriels Wedding' and 'The Sixth Sense' and I thought she was great in both. These two roles are totally different from eachother as were the films which show great diversity in Toni's acting skills. She was hilarious in Muriels Wedding and very convincing as the worried, distressed mother in Sixth Sense. I would love to see her in other films. Good luck Toni and keep up the good work!
