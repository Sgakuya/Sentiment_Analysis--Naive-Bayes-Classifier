AT T must be having a hard time staying in the red this quarter. THey are consistently mis-billing with over charges, saying they never received payments (while I have the cancelled check from my bank), etc., and while doing this, they are threatening with 5 days notice to cut off service if I don't pay the charges that they made up! FYI, I know a corporate communications officer who is in charge of his company's multi-million dollar account with AT T, and they are doing the same thing to him -- even threatening to cut off the company's service. Not looking good. I've ended all of my personal contracts with them, and urge others to do likewise -- or at least go through your bill with a fine-toothed comb.
