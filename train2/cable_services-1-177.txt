I hace dish network and the only reason we upgraded last year was to get the OLN network as I am a big fan of the PBR and they Took of OLN right before the finals in Las Vegas It was not right to do that they said that Comcast made unreasonable demands and would force people to pay more. When I e-mailed the PBR they were sorry to hear that Dish took OLN off and told me I would have to get cable tv or swithc to Direct. I am thinking of going to Direct TV as welive out in the country and cannot get cable tv.
