why does this woman keep getting work?? she is fundamentally incapable of saying a line -- any line -- credibly. her acting is straight out of high school theatre -- overemphasized, falsely emotional and one-note. i felt awful for the fabulous kyle secor having to play opposite Delaney in the deservedly short-lived philly (who could put up with an hour focused on this bimbo?). just dreadful.
