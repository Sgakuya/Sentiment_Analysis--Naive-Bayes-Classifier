Abu Dhabi is a HELLHOLE!!!!! It's totally unorganized, full of dangerous traffic, confusing, and the people are SO RUDE! The prices are way more in this emirate than in any of the others for the same things! I currently live in Abu Dhabi only because of work, but I hate it! I can't wait to move to Dubai! I can say that H.H. Sheikh Zayed is #1, though! :) God bless him!
