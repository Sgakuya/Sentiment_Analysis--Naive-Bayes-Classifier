Selleck is an obvious idiot, both in his acting skills (or lack thereof), as well as his political leanings (Republican who refuses to allow any amount of blood spilled in schoolyards to even consider the notion of gun control). He was charismatic on TV in Magnum, P.I., but has rapidly gotten in over his head trying to carry various movie roles. And now he's just a sorry caricature of himself in numerous cameo roles, which is the only kind of work he can understandably scrape up these days. Every night I thank God that his Magnum commitment kept him from sullying the role of Indiana Jones. Deservedly resigned to the acting dust-bin.
