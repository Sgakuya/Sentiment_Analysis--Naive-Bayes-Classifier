for those that dont remember whenRedMan WAS a great product when its stated Large Leaf' THATS EXACTLY what it was.. So Now for False Advertising.. If ya take notice next time ya open a bag,,Take Note of the twigs.stems an what else..? NO LARGE LEAF.. just like floor cuttings..swept up off the floor!! So pay attention next time yalls open a bag and spent anywhere from $4-$5.oo plus change on a bag.. Ya ought to be a SHAME RedMan for doin yer customers like this!!
