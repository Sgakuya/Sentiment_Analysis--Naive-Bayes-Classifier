Redrum Redrum - spoken in a croacky voice while wiggling your finger. How many times have you done that? Unusually this was one book that I read after the film. I always like to form my own pictures of the characters before watching the film. However, Nicholson was the perfect Jack (here's Johnny!!!) and the two were both excellent. I think the book was far superior and the TV version with Rebecca De Mornay was far better as it was written by King and therefore just like the film. I love this book and will never stay in a hotel over winter again!
