 Stranger Than Paradise is a minimalist masterpiece. Down By Law was a very creative take on the age-old genre of the prison escape flick. Night On Earth was quite compelling and Mystery Train was an understated, well constructed hoot. Intriguing premises, strong scripts marked by sharply defined characters, outstanding performances in each of his films. Visually intriguing. You have to seriously consider a director who would cast Tom Waits and John Lurie in the same film with Roberto Beginini, Gena Rowlands with Winona Ryder, Joe Strummer with Steve Buschemi and Screamin' Jay Hawkins. Jarmusch is perhaps the most overlooked director currently working.
