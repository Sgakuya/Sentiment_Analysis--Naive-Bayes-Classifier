Fitzgeld wrote a big pile of crap as far as his novels are concerned, but his short stories and this book are of first order. Gatsby is so tightly written it doesn't seem that a single word is out of place. Ranks up there with Nathanael West and Flaubert in terms of economy and grace. Very atmospheric and evocative of its times. Also one of the most accessible of the major American novels. I don't what book jbennett is talking about, but Gatsby can hardly be called long winded : the book is probably less than 40,000 words in length, which makes it about half the length of the average novel.
