Class Act.... When Joaquin portrayed the role of Jack Morrison in Ladder 49, I tried to think of the last time I saw an actor peg his role as acurately, I could only think of 2 times, Dustin Hoffman in Rainman and Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. I can not believe how right on he was in this role. I think that Joaquin Phoenix will go down as one of the greats.
