I have watched Courteney for years on Friends and I think CCA has done so many different things on Friends. First fat Monica, best friend Monica, Richard's Monica,Chandler's Monica, Ross's sister and now wife Monica. I think CCA has had the largest range of acting on Friends and can not understand why she has not received the Emmy! I think she has been wonderful plus ahe is so pretty! I am a huge fan of Monica and Chandler and think their pairing was terrific. Now I hope there will be a little Bing in season eight or nine!
