She's one of my favourite actress, she's the really expression of feminility, and that's what I think, she's also very professional and (for me) she's very good looking woman. Sincerely, I don't know her private life (as I really would like to know it, that's sure !), but she seems so strong and sweet woman. I'd like to know your opinions about that ! Final comment: I really like her (simple !). Bye.
