Julie Andrews is cool as hell! My mother is her #1 fan. She is a great actress and had a beautiful singing voice. It's a shame that it didn't come back the way it should have after her surgery. But she can still act! Have you seen her recently in Shrek 2 as the Queen? She was great. LOL, It's so wonderful to have the family together for dinner! as Shrek and the King are arguing.
