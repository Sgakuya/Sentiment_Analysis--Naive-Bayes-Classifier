Saint Louis sucks, Ive been there, I I dont understand the hype about it. The downtown really sucks, there are no tall buildings and the only thing that makes st louis is the arch, If this city didnt have the arch, than it what only be a small town, by the way, Im from Kansas City, and KC had a bigger Downtown, more urban, and we've invested 4 billion dollars in our downtown deveoplment.
