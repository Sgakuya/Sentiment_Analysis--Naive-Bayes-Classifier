I almost considered buying this one until the recall start to come in. The Escape/Tribute look excellent on paper, but it's my money and I don't want a vehicle that's been recall so many times. It tell me that the company is not doing their job right. Why can't domestic car manufacturer get their car right the first time. There's a reason that the GM/Ford/DC is losing market shares
