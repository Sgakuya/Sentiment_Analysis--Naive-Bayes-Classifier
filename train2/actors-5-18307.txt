Alfred Hitchcock and I would say Orson Welles are two of cinema's most impressive, influential, important and unforgettable directors. Hitchcock film's are classics and his style and technique are still emulated today. Take Psycho, his most famous film, a movie that still shocks today. The movie works because Hitchock did go for cheap gratuitous violence to scare the audience. It's the unexpected, it's the sudden impact that jolts you. Hitchcock made so many memorable movies and he was the master of suspense. His movies had great, unforgettable characters, intrigue, danger, humor, and a twist. My personal favorites are Dial M For Murder starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Bob Cummings and John Williams. Ray Milland plans to have his wife murdered when he finds out she's been unfaithful. However she kills her attacker, and things take a twist from there. Ray Milland is devilishly sly. John Williams is superb as the Chief Inspector. The next film I would recommend would be Strangers on a Train starring Robert Walker and Farley Granger. It has Hitchcock's best villian(Robert Walker as Bruno Antony) It tells the story of two strangers who meet on a train and sort of swap murders. Finally I would recommend Hitchcock's personal favrorite film Shadow of a Doubt starring the magnificent Joseph Cotten in a role sort of out of character in what you may be used to seeing him portray. Theresa Wright also stars and is wonderful The movie also stars Henry Travers, Hume Cronyn, MacDonald Carey and Patricia Collinge. The movie is about Charlie a young teen who was named after her Uncle Charlie and just adores him. Uncle Charlie comes to stay with the family and from all appearances he seems like a decent guy until young Charlie learns the truth and finds out that he's really a serial killer. Great performances all around. Film examines the disruption of a suburban family.
