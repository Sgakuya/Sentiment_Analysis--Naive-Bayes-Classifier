Toni Collete is probably one of the best actresses to come out of Australia in recent history (Rachel Griffiths being another one). She was amazing in The Sixth Sense and she spoke like a genuine Philly girl effortlessly. In Velvet Goldmine , she spoke like an American with a phony British accent and you truly believed this woman WAS an American with a phony British accent! Sometimes, I think to myself that it must be illegal for one person to be so incredibly talented AND beautiful! To any fan out there: Catch her Cosi and be further amazed! I can't wait to see what she does in the years to come!
