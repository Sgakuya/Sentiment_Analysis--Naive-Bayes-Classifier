Loud mouth, hot head, scumbag, worthless, untalented, egotistical...the list goes on. Wouldn't watch his work if someone offeed to pay me. I wish he HAD moved out of the country like he promised when his budy Al Gore didn't win. Baldwin suffers delusions of grandeur when he believes people listen to him or care about what he has to say. His words are nothing but the ramblings of a man desperately in love with himself and the sound of his own voice. Please, Alec Baldwin, shut your pie hole!
