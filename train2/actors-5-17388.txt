Genie Francis shines with beauty and emotions in her character of Laura. No other character has won my loyalty and support in a daytime drama. I have watch Laura from the beginning to the end. And I can honestly say, that Genie grew with her talent. Such beauty --- and her eyes said it all. She is greatly missed on GH. Hope she will return soon and this soap realizes what a gem they have in her.
