The free museums are the only attribute of this awful city. DC surpasses New York when it comes to the rudeness and lack of friendliness of the people. Terrible traffic, high crime (dangerous even to walk your dog at night), filthy, the Anacostia and Potomac rivers are among the ten worst in the U.S. for pollution. Summer weather is miserably hot and humid with poor air quality. Physically the city is unimpressive, built on a low, flat, swampy plain. The parts of the city you never see in the tourist brochures (northeast and southeast) are the ugliest urban slums you will find anywhere. Oh, and the corrupt and inefficient DC government. XM Satellite Radio is headquartered here in an area so drab and uninspired a six-figure salary couldn't lure me to work there. Most people who do work in DC are government drones whose biggest career goal is to retire. I could go on and on but I'll stop here.
