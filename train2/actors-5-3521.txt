There are very few actors that will do the true research for a role to make it genuine (Leaving Las Vegas)or take chances like Nicolas has in his movie career. He still a has a big heart and has not let all the success from his carreer tant him. How many actors/actress can you name that would push themselves so hard, just so they could fly to see thier children on the weekends???
