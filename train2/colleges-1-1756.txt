The school is ranked high, but there's no intellectual stimulating environment at USC. Many students there are engrossed in greek life and if you're not a part of them, they won't bother to talk to you. Many students tend to be snobby too. I've also had rude and mean professors who played favoritism and some didn't seem to care to teach at all. If you are a rich spoiled brat, and looking for glamor, come to USC. Otherwise, go to a UC campus or an east coast ivy college.
