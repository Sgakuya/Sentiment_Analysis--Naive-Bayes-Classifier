Biggest problem with Bank of America: their terrible checkcard/overdraft fee system. Truly, it's designed to unfairly win them money. Almost every card I make with the card appears on the card the day I make it. Terrific. Then the charge *vanishes* the next day. Two days later, the charge always returns. Their standard line is "oh, well the merchant didn't provide us with the charge confirmation, we don't post the charge until we get that". Oh really? Then how come I always see the charge the day I make it? So two days after I make a few charges, I check my card at the ATM to see how much money I have available, and it says $100. So I withdraw $100. Then the next day, all the charges I made that they *forgot to list* when I checked my balance come back, and they whack me with a $39 fee PER charge! Up to five a day! Recently I bought a $600 plane ticket on Expedia.com after checking my balance online, which said I had $650 available. Cool. So I buy the ticket. Turns out I had made two charges the day before which it didn't list, and when they came in not only was I charged $39 for the Expedia charge, but I was charged an *additional* $39 for the $5 Expedia fee. Two overdraft charges for one transaction, when they said on their own site that I had this money available? Yeah, great bank. Someone above said I need to be adult and track all my finances. I do, but as a human in 2005 I use tools to do it -- primarily what my bank says I've done with my card. Given that they could easily make recent charges to my card *not* disappear and the reappear later... why don't they?
