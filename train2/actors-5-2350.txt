Poor Mel...wife always dies in the movies....It's a PLOY!....Makes the female viewers go wild because he's an available type. Good thinking...Men are never as sexy as Mel when they're married.....In fact, men are never as sexy as Mel. (I can't believe I said that...I HAVE NEVER in my 41 years ever referred to any man as sexy....at least not until I rented out all 4 Lethal Weapon movies the other day. And even though Mel is older in Signs , its one of my favourites all around.
