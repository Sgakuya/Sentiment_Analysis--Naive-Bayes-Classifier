Truth: I had never seen anything by him until tonight. I didn't like him too much, and I'd heard some bad stuff about him(which was really quite stupid because 99.9% of the people that told me things hadn't even met him). After seing Gladiator , however, I can give him a full 5 stars and not regret it. He did such a great job, it makes me shiver just thinking about what I missed out on before this movie..
