Harley's SUCK. They cost twice as much as they are worth. The leak oil, break down, and rattle themselves apart. Oh yes and resale value.. well once all the middle age men who own Harley's decide they are to old to ride who is going to buy these overpriced pieces of junk. Certainly not the younger guys....they are used to sportbikes that offer higher horsepower and better technology at a fraction of the price. But if IMAGE is what your all about by all means march down to your local Harley dealership to get screwed like all the other lemmings.
