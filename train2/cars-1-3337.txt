I have a 1999 Grand Cherokee Laredo - fell in love with the handeling and styling. Unfortunately, I have had MANY problems (fuel pump replaced TWICE, transmission replaced TWICE, water pump replaced, repainted because paint flaking off, front power windows failed, leaky rear window/door weather seals, warped rotors, etc.) My Jeep has been religiously serviced and has never left a paved road. What a shame - it is really a nice car when it isn't broken...
