Fish Blarney is a crooked employer in a crooked industry that employs only the most crooked of employees. Jerk Goofyon in the webster office is their crook of crooks. He lost my money because it was in his best interest to do so. He did it by putting my money where it would maximize his income regardless of losses to my money. He invested my money in financial instruments that rewarded him, not me, the most, such as revenue sharing ,probaby free trips, etc...He lost so much of my money that he was forced to buy me an annuity inside an IRA inorder to get a big fat comission. What a jerk! All of wall street exists to steal your money..all of it if possible.
