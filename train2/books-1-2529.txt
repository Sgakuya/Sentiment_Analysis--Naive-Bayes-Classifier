Ah, Enkidu! Gilgamesh asked me to say hello... Anyway - Cathy: Not the worst comic ever - Hillary Price has got that wrapped up for all time. But getting there. Three jokes since 1976, each of them funny once. And most artists, even the wonderful Ms Price, make the occasional attempt to show their characters in side profile. But in Cathy's world, they can only face you. Handy for the arm-raising declamation about the vagaries of dieting/marriage/shopping that ends each strip as it had the previous day and as it will the next. And since 1/3rd of potential jokes will vanish once she gets married, get set for a lot more trips to the store! Those wacky clerks! So different each day!
