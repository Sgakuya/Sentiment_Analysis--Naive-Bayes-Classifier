I appreciate the offbeat humor of Gary Larsen. The comic's not for everyone, but I find that most people like his work. Like all comics, some fall short, then others are great, and for me, he's had way more hits than misses. A lot of his humor is based on science, specifically biology. If you get The PreHistory of The Far Side: A 10th Anniversary Exhibit (1989), he explains a few of the misconceptions of his comics (like the one labeled When car chasers dream (p. 162), with the dog on the car--no, he's not mating with the car, but it sure looks like it . . . . he says it was definately not his intention).
