Saw the movie first, In my opinion you should never see the movie before you read the book. Your imagination doesn't have the freedom to think about the characters and the scenes when you already have a specific picture of what these people and places look like. Loved how the book took it's time in developing each of the characters and with the various time periods that the story deals with. I also liked how the mood of the book could change at the drop of a hat. I have never read a book that utilized sentiment, suspense and horror so well. This is one of the few books that truly scared me and I actually had to put it down more than once. King is the master of horror and this is one of his best. The movie was good but it was merely a half hearted attempt to cram a long book into a movie. Would have been better off approaching IT like they did The Stand. Two more hours could have explained a lot more.
