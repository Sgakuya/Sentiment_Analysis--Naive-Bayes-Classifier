1 word describes Sprint..SUCKS Sorry about the language but when your in a emergerncy type siduation and sprint looses your connection constantly and then they tell you your phone needs repair come right in and they will take care of it..You go and then they expect you to wait 5 hours for assistance and I might add the assistant that talked to me and mentioned others come first was rude and had no concern about my emergency or condition..My one work description in the beginning of this note is SOOOOOO CORRECT
