To settle this once and for all there is no comparrison between Jess Walton and Brenda Dickson. First, Jess Walton has no talent period. All she can do is frown, grunt, and yell. Brenda Dickson brought grace, style, and versatility to the role of Jill. People would tune in everyday just to see what she was wearing. The chemistry between her and Jene Cooper was electrifying. They could just stand in the same room and sparks would fly. I hate to say this but I agree, even Deborah Adair would have been a better replacement for Brenda. I still hope one day Brenda will return to the role that was made for her. She is the one and only Jill Abbott. Jess Walton needs to crawl in a hole and stay there.
