The Ramona books were the first chapter books I read. So many little girls (and probably boys, too) can empathize with Ramona. And their older siblings can surely empathize with her older sister, Beezus. She is one of my favorite characters in a children's book - full of spunk and imagination. And the challenges she faces are exactly what all kids her age face, wherever or whenever they grow up. A definite must for any kid who is old enough to read chapter books!
