Yoplait uses a cheap processed ingredient called HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP instead of real sugar. HFCS is much cheaper to use as an ingredient and this is why companies use it. It doesn't even taste good. It is an overkill of sweetness and tastes artificial. HFCS is not organic. Its derived and processed thru corn, but that doesn't make it natural and organic--Its processed. If Yoplait would resort to using REAL sugar, then that would be a good idea.
