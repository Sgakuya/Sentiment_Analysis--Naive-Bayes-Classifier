IMO, the greatest actor, at least of the last 30 years. Like everyone does, he is fading as he ages, playing the same, unchallenging characters, but even if he sucks from now untill he stops he still deserves to go down as the Greatest! Just watch Godfather II, Dog Day Afternoon, Scarface, Sea of Love and Donnie Brasco. Nobody else compares, not DeNiro, not Nicholson, not even Hoffman.
