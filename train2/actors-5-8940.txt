The first movie I ever saw Sandra Bullock in was The Net . I didn't even know who she was before that. Since then I have made it a point to see every movie she has been in. There are only a couple of movies that she has done that I don't care for, In Love and War , and The Thing Called Love . She did great acting in In Love and War and I liked the story, but I just don't care to see war movies. In The Thing Called Love I don't know who chose this movie for her, but it is not Sandy. I have the movie, and have not been able to watch the whole thing, it is just so boring. I don't hold anything against her for those 2 movies. I think a true fan can't say they like every movie she has done.----Now onto Sandra Bullock her self. I think one of the best career moves she has done was start up Fortis Films. This gives her alot more input to her movies, besides just acting. I do alot of searching on the internet to keep myself updated about her. One of the best reasons I watch her movies is not for her acting in the movie, it is the way she acts out of her movies. She is one of the few major Hollywood celebrities that doesn't act like a celebrity in public. She tries to remain low-key and doesn't use her status to glorify her self. This is where she gains the most respect from me.---Good luck in your future endeavors Sandra Bullock.
