I really enjoy John Irving and Hotel New Hampshire is no exception. A complex look at a family with a diverse background. This story follows them through every phase of their lives including loves, deaths, sorrow and joy. A complete journey filled with every emotion possible. I also enjoy Irving's writing because he includes twists yet keeps everything very possible. Hotel New Hampshire is an excellent introduction to Irving's style, and a must read for his fans.
