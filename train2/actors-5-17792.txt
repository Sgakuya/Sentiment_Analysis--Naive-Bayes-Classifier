For all the Y R watchers who can't get over Brenda, let's just say that Jess Walton has more than earned her spot. She is the only Jill and by far the best actress in the role. She can switch emotions on a dime and make you like her even when Jill is being her worst. JW rocks and I would really like to know how she looks so damn good at the age of 57!
