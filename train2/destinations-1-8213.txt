BEWARE, THEY STEAL IN THE VALET PARKING That's what happen to us this February 2004. In short, this is what happen to us. When we got to the casino we decided to leave the car at their valet parking while we went to register. Then we went up to the room (which the electronic entrance card DID NOT work) to relax. Then came back to pick up the car. But, to our surprise our car was vandalized, things were stolen from inside the car and the truck. Worse yet, the theft was perpetuated by the employees of the valet parking. Why I say this? Because there were not broken windows and the doors were locked. They stole from us several things: a TV/Radio/CD Player combo, music CDs, sunglasses, prescription eyeglasses and a digital camera. All these were not left for people to see. They wore hidden in the car and back in the trunk. Looking back, I regret the decision not to take EVERYTHING from the car to the room. Right there, when we got the car we complain to the valet parking people, to the hotel security, and to the hotel's Director of Risk Management (supposedly he was going to take care of it). But, their answer was: the casino is not liable for theft unless the car is vandalized, i.e., broken windows and that there are no video cameras at the valet parking lot (yeah sure, every where else there are cameras but not here, how convenient). So they cannot do a thing. SO, DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
