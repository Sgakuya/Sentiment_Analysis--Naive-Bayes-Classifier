I totally hate London & The whole of England & Europe. But England sucks big time. I hated it so much I am happy to say I now live in Canada . Things I hate about the UK I hate the ignorant louts I hate Drunks Puking on walls I hate the constant swearing I hate Soccer or as the Brits call it Football I hate Cricket & Rugby I hate the Pub Culture I hate the whole God Dam Dirty City I hate British Food I hate British Politics I hate British Opinion I hate British Weather I hate Coronation Street Crossroads The Bill Emerdale Farm & Eastenders I hate Cockney I hate all the uneducated People I hate the British Weather I hate the small talk I think the only good thing in the UK are a few nightclubs but if I never see England ever again it will be to soon. I pray I never have to return to the the horrible place called of England. I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo happy I no longer live in the UK.
