A 'fuery tale for grown ups'. This book is presented as a childrens story that includes the usual talking form animals that is actually an extended metaphor for the communist revolution. It's great fun to pick out the parables: commies are represented as pigs, capitalists as farmers, dogs as soliders, and impossible to miss the poigniant message from the disillusioned author, that the communists took the place of the Russian bargcois. A scathing indictment of Red Russia that is recommeded for any student who joins the campus communism club.
