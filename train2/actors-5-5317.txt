Hey, I like the guy too. Talented in the extreme though he has sometimes gone a tad over the top, some very well done excellent film roles to his credit, not to mention a pair of gorgeous brown eyes with enough intensity to melt ice. I also wish him well and hope he takes this current opportunity to straighten out. But let's face it, I don't think there was much acting going on in Less than Zero . Probably closer to the docu-drama category than originally intended.
