Anthony Geary is one of the most dynamic and exciting actors to ever grace the screen. Hi is tremendous actor. I have watched him as Luke spencer on General Hospital for over 30 years off and on. I also really liked Genie Frances as Laura and think the show really should get her back. Anthony, you are the one who could get her back for us. The two of you back together as Luke and Laura would be so terrific. Thank you for the years of drama and adventure on General Hospital.
