An actor of rare potential, Tobey Maguire has the uncanny knack of these understated, sensitive performances. He has knocked everyone's socks off with his popular role in the Spider-Man blockbusters and yet still regained his credibility with his gentle, deep roles in Cider House Rules and Seabiscuit. The heart and humanity he puts in his work is simply fantastic. In a world of loud, Vin Diesel-esque actors, Maguire is a burst of fresh air, no matter the film.
