this is the worst bank ever. Each month I paid the full balance on my credit card bill, yet they say i always only paid the minimum payment. Now I'm paying for all the interest my imaginary minimum payments accrued. That plus other nasty stuff, like my rate being increased 3 dollars---1/2 an hour after i had just talked to them!!!!!!! And weird stuff---like checks bouncing when they in fact they were paid.
