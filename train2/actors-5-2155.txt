In my opinion, Robin Williams is one of the most talented, universal actors of our time. He has such amazing depth and range- he truly becomes his character in each film. He can do both dramatic and comedic roles, as his long resume proves. He's done several children's movies (Flubber, Jack, and Hook). My favorite movie is Mrs. Doubtfire, and of course, it is because I loved Robin Williams' performance. He managed to mix in drama with a lot of comedy very effectively. Williams was excellent as the kind-hearted Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting. He also did a good job in Jakob the Liar and Patch Adams. Recently, however, Williams has been exploring new bounds. undertaking more deranged roles. In One Hour Photo, Williams gave a riveting performance as the lonely, deranged Sy Parrish who becomes obsessed with a family that visits his film desk. Equally riveting was his performance was as the creepy murder suspect Walter Finch who plays a thrilling game of cat and mouse with a detective played by Al Pacino. Besides being one of the greatest comedians of our time, I also believe that Robin Williams is a fantastic actor who is amazingly versatile. I believe he will go down as one of the greatest actors of our time.
