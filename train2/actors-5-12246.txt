Good lord, I read some of these comments and gotta know what the hell is wrong with you people? This woman has worked her ass off to get where she's at and she deserves all the success she recieves. She was an AWSOME Dorathy Dandridge and every movies she has made I have enjoyed. She is also the HOTTEST women in Hollywood at the moment and not to just African American men. I can't beleive she is not in the the top ten. Even that snooty ass Helen Hunt is higher on this list. Stop being envious and do this woman some justice!
