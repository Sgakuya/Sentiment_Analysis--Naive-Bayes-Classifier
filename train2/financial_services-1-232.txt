this bank absolutely sucks. I go away on vacation, withdraw $500 cash on two different occasions, then they shut my card off for "suspicious activity" without even calling me!! I try to call back to find out what is going on and after business hours you get a recording telling you to call back during business hours!! what if I needed MY money in an emergency? This happened twice.
