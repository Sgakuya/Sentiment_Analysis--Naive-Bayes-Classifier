She thinks too much of herself. Only because she married Michale Douglas she thinks she is all that- I m sure it was all about love when she married him??!!! ;-) I dont think she is a good actress. She seems very full of herself, very obnoxious and waaay too self-sure. She married a very rich and very old guy- she got fame through him. Those are all the things a *hore would do and not a classy woman.
