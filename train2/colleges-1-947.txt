Avoid psychology with Palm-Jones and sociology with Armstrong. I read Michael Moore's books and saw his films, and enjoyed them very much for the social commentary he made. However, they were not required materials or part of the course description. Standing on a soapbox and preaching to a capitive audience about them was done in a way that did not relate to the course. Also, I deeply respect the Muslim faith, but the assertion that it is superior to other faiths seemed unbalanced. The indiscreet comments about the Army and soldiers were hurtful. Without the Army contract the UMUC instructors would not have jobs. We did not deserve to be attacked on 9-11, and nobody in the world deserves to die in such a way...anywhere in the world. This kind of quality of instruction, and course materials, seems too common at UMUC. I think some sensitivity training might be useful in some cases.
