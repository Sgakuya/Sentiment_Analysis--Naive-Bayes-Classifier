Anyone who doesn't see their teenage son or a boy they knew as a teenager hasn't lived in the real world. Sometimes Jeremy seems like the stereotypical teenager, but at least he doesn't say LOL. A psychiatrist for a mother and an orthodontist for a father are hard to live down. His high school life could be anyone's.
