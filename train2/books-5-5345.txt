I love this book as well, but am I missing something? Why is every reviewer comment a summary/description/review of the book? Nobody would be commenting on this unless they had read it, ya know? Anyway, wonderful book. One of those you end up reading twice. I know this is a cliche when discussing this book, but it is just so haunting and beautiful. On another note, I felt Ribisi really nailed the narraration in the movie. He was speaking it the exact way I heard it in my head when reading the book. I enjoyed the movie almost as much as the book. As dark a story as it was, there was something calming and peaceful about it aside from the haunting aspect of it.........actually, not aside - that was peaceful in a weird way too. I'll stop being cheesey and just say, I love this book. It inspired me to write.
