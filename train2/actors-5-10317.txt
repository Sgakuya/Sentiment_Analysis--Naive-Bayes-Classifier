About two years ago Hilary was criticised for not taking the main stream route of most Oscar winners and shunning bland Hollywood scripts with mediocre characters. I read somewhere that she found it important not to let her art suffer as she did a stage play in New York shortly after her Oscar win with very little payment. These same critics fail to tell the difference between a celebrity and an actress and you have to respect Hilary for taking good roles in low budget films such as The Gift, Million Dollar Baby and Boys Don't Cry not for the sake of money, fame and popularity, but to stay true to herself and remind herself as to why she went into the business in the first place.
