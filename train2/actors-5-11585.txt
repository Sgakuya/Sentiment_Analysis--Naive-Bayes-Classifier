I would give her a 6 if I could. All you Meg haters crying about her ditzy Sleepless and Got Mail roles need to see some of her other work. She shows great depth when challenged by her roles. I am 28, and still would pick Meg over all those scrawny, bitchy twentysomething actresses. She is the one actress who can give me that funny happy feeling with her smile.
