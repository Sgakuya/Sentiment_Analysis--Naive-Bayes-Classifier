Deborah Kerr had a unique acting talent. She could do anything on screen AND stage: comedy, drama, historical, accents - and was more than a fair dancer. I am trained opera singer, so take my word for it that anyone is completely naive (my first word choice was "idiot") who claims that D.K. not being able to sing the demanding lyric tunes of "The King and I" is some sort of detriment to her talent. In fact, not only was she an accomplished actress and dancer, she paints as well. Deborah Kerr was a supremely talented performing artist and a woman who celebrated the art within her as opposed to herself in the art. Sadly, D.K. has been combating Parkinson's for over a decade, so all we have of her contributions are her films and other memories. (My eternal envy to any fan who was able to meet her in person! :-)) Katherine P.S. To the "homophile" who dissed D.K.'s performance in "Tea and Sympathy": I think you'll appreciate her performance more if you suspend your militancy. The real story is about not being understood. As for the homosexual "slams" - (1) that's Robert Anderson's material, so fire away at him, not Deborah Kerr; and (2) the REAL gay person in there was the husband. Robert Anderson and anyone who knows the play realizes that Bill's latent homosexuality is another tragedy in the play - what happens to a person when s/he is not being true to himself/herself.
