Bank of America just informed that they cancel my card and reissued another with obtaining my approval. I simple informed them that I did not like the way they were not responding to my request in reversing a transaction that wasn't mine. The finally responded after three e-mails to tell me that were cancelling my card. What a butch of SOB's. I am going to move all business to another bank.
