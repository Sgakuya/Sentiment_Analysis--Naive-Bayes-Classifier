The people of Maryland voted AGAINST this stadium in a statewide referendum but it was built anyway because big money and politics demanded it. Its too small, too crowded, and has made the downtown area a hell-hole of traffice jams, crime, and trash. I long for Memorial Stadium again. It was a crime to destroy it, and it is a testament to the incredible lunacy of the politics involved that a perfectly good stadium was utterly demolished, and a smaller inadequate one built to replace it.
