Some may say he is, ...one of the best British actors... Others may simply contribute their affection for Mr. Fiennes to his physical attributes. I don't disagree with these two impressions; however, Mr. Ralph Fiennes is one of the BEST ACTORS, be he British or Ethiopian, alive, and he would still be appealing to the discriminating play/film-goer if he had a visage such as that of the burned man he once portrayed. For those of us who are unable to see him on stage, I can only hope that, in the years to come, he continues to provide many more inspiring screen appearances. I would especially recommend Onegin, The English Patient, and Oscar and Lucinda.
