Governor Bush has vetoed every attempt to raise the minimum wage- in a state with spiraling housing costs- how do you live? In the streets....? I have seen too many rednecks and cockroaches (not that the two are related) Some really jazzy toney places like Naples and Palm Beach- but you gotta have $$$$ to live here- and in many other areas of this state now. That Cole Porter tune...'It's Too Damn Hot'..well thats Florida- and becoming wetter as well. Average classroom size 40- dreadful- this state may have wonderful winter escapes and Theme Parks- but its not cheap now- the overall quality of life is much lower then the number given here.
