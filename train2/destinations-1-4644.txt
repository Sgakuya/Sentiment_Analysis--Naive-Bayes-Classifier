Tennessee should be ashamed of itself for allowing the poor of Memphis to live in such horrible conditions. I was totally appalled by Memphis. Run-down public housing everywhere you look. And it never gets any better...mile after mile shacks and thugs and prostitutes, etc. Memphis makes New Orleans look like Beverly Hills...and that is REALLY bad. The whole city is run-down and abandoned. Who needs gates when you totally abandon the city?
