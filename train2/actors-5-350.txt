The silent screen's chivalrous angel ,the daring ingenuous little hero ever ready to (quite literally)risk life and limb for the sake of a damsel in distress.The charming master of deadpan expressiveness and comic timing.His best films-Our Hospitality,Sherlock Jnr(the 2nd half in particular a miracle of invention),The Navigator,The General(his masterpiece,which only grows with repeated viewings)and Steamboat Bill Jnr(with its breathtaking cyclone finale)-are timeless,wondrous.A genius to rival Chaplin,Keaton's flawless,wholly cinematic visual sense,subtle delivery and less overtly sentimental persona have met with deserved critical appreciation since the sixties.It saddens me that silent cinema, a much purer visual means of expression than the contemporary product,remains neglected and little-known to the movie-going public.Don't be deterred by the intertitles(which anyway reduce in frequency after the initial scene-setting),or common misconceptions;films like Sunrise(unutterably lovely,one of my all-time top 5)The Gold Rush,Metropolis,The Passion of Joan of Arc(a sublime work of art),City Lights,Battleship Potemkin,among many others,have lost none of their sparkle or their power to entertain,to thrill and to move.And why not start with the splendid,the valiant,the irrepressible Keaton?
