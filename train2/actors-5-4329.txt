Gary Sinise is a great actor who seems underrated. Anyone who has seen his past performances can attest to his talent. And even more so, he has a cause which is worthwhile in today's post-9/11 world, unlike many in Hollywood. I hope more directors will pick up on how wonderful an actor Sinise really is, and use him in more lead roles.
