Russell is the most amazing actor/man I've ever seen. This is the best summation I can find Take one male, make him tall, heavy muscled, clear eyed, square chinned, give him a deep voice, a sexy accent, thick wavy hair and a soft thick beard. Put him in uniform, or armor, or a loin cloth. Give him attitude, intelligence, a touch of little boy, a hint of pain, and the leadership qualities of a lion. Hit all of it with the big MALE wand and stand back. Poof . . . Russell Crowe. Talent, charisma, sex appeal, charm, vulnerabilty, beauty, and pure magnetism. He never ceases to amaze and delight me.
