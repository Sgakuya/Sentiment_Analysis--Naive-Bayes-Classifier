I first found the strip in 1997, not long after it started, and I've been hooked ever since. Bill Holbrook creates a very broad series of story lines - from the frivolous to the relatively serious - while keeping the reader thoroughly amused. Bill uses his considerable skill as both author and artist to hold the proverbial mirror up to life and show us ourselves and just how ridiculous we can all be at times but never crosses the line into preaching. This is strip is a classic.
