For anyone who enjoys Vonnegut as much as I do, his story of the bombing of Dresden during World War II and the psycho-social ramifications of subsequent actions reflected Vonnegut's tenure as a flier during World War II, when his squadron went on bombing raids over Nazi Germany. Vonnegut's mastery of nihilism and pessimism in his disjointed chapters leaves the reader as if (s)he has taken on a journey of Sisyphean proportions. I read this in sixth grade and I was left with a cold, surreal feeling about my actions and all factors that play into my daily life. Very good reading for those who question why we do what we do, and what the outcome(s) will be.
