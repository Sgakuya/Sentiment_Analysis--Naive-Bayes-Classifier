Steinbeck is blessed with the storytelling gift. I felt, upon reading The Grapes of Wrath, as if I was sitting across a fire from him while he recollected aloud his trip from Oklahoma to the thankless farmlands of California during the Great Depression. What Woody Guthrie did with music in his Dust Bowl Ballads, Steinbeck did with language in this strikingly personal yet universally relevant novel. You will never feel broke again if you think of the Joads on pay day.
