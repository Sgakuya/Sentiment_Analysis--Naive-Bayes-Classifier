The most putrid substance ever conceived by man. It looks horrible and it tastes horrible (I guess there's not really a smell, although if there was, that'd be horrible too.) The only benefit of Surge is its' garguantuan amounts of caffiene. I mean, really, just go buy a Mountain Dew a latte or something.
