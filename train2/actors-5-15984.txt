A very talented and charismatic actor. I love the guy. He's always in the scene, listening, reacting, not just reciting lines. He conveys great vulnerability and tenderness underneath a tough hot-headed exterior. I just want to hug him. I just wish TPTB gave the guy a storyline worthy of his talents.
