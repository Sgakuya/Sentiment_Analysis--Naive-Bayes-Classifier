There are people in this country who have an absolutely fanatical interest in the Civil War. Indeed Tony Horwitz's great grandfather's first purchase in this country after he migrated from Russia in 1882 was a pictorial history of this War. Horwitz did a tremendous job of dispelling some myths and bringing the Civil War right into the present by traveling to battle grounds, interviewing many people and even spooning with reenactors, so hardcore that they have dieted to appear as starved Confederate soldiers. I loved this book!
