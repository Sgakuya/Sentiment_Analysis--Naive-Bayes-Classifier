Yuck. Yoo-Hoo is like a synthetic chocolate experiment that went very wrong and killed it's creators. Try to avoid it at all costs. If you want a real chocolate taste, buy REAL chocolate milk. At least that doesn't taste like a vat of chemicals. Why would a company TRY to make a beverage taste like Yoo-Hoo on purpose?? It boggles the mind.
