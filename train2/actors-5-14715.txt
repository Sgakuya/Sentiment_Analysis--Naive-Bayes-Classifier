The amount of one-star ratings J.Lo has recieved is quite troubling. Sure, she's an egotistical, materialistic, promiscuous, talentless 'celebrity' who is popular only for her (nonexistent) good looks - but these days, what actor, actress or singer ISN'T? Call me a devil's advocate, but I speak the truth.
