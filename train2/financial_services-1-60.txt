I'm sure where to start. I am so mad at that bank. I have been a customer for more than 15 years, through buyout after buyout. I found out that by account was transferred 5 years ago to a bank 45 miles from where I originally opened it and they can't move it back. ***DO not believe the online site that shows you account balance*** even though it updates immediately (ITS WRONG) I have items on the site showing they were paid and I still had a positive balance but there system show those items paid on a negative balance. they told me to check my ledger I should have known that these items were out and known they were going to cause a problem...why would I think that if the website shows them as paid and still having a positive balance. I had two items out and a positive balance still and when my paycheck went through I had 11 overdrafts. Because their system showed me negative and their website showed me positive. Even though the website belonged to them and they update the info every 3 hours they always went back to their internally seen unless asked for a printout system! and kept telling I should be balancing my checkbook.. I do I do I do but like I said the website shows them as being paid and me with a positive balance. the guy at the Webster groves Missouri location, Cameron Noel was an total asshole to me, he basically told me so what and if you to close your account over it then Goodbye. They don't care because Banks make their Billions and a few extra dollars from you and me...USBANK are crooks.
