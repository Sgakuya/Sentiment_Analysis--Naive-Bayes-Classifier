He is just terrific. I was introduced to his talent as a child in the 60s when my parents bought his comedy albums. His ability to tell stories was so good. I could just picture him hiding from that chicken heart, or his pals Fat Albert. He is great at stand up comedy, I liked his video Bill Cosby- himself. His show in the 80s the Cosby show was great. i have always enjoyed his work.
