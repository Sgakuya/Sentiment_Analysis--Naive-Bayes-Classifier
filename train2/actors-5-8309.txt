There has never been a more enchanting actress to grace our screens. Vivien brought so much depth to her character. Every role that she ever had I could never imagine anyone else playing it. I wish there was some way that we could see all of her stage preformances for that is where she truely loved to be. Her and Laurence were the perfect pair to ever grace England.
