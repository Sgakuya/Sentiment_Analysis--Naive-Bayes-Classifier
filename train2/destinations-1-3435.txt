I grew up in western MA and lived there for 35 years til i moved to Colorado years back and while Boston is a wonderful city to visit with lots to see and do it sucks to live there. People here (like most of MA in general) are cold, unfriendly, stuck up rude folks who think they are God's gift to the world, lots of rich snotty college kids live in Boston too. Rents are WAY too high here and jobs don't pay much which is why more people are moving out. Boston used to be a cool city 30 years ago to live in but it's been ruined by many factors.
