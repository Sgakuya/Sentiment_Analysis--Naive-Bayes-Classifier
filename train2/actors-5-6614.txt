I think he is a very good actor.For those of you who say he has no range beyond his good guy;you should watch An Awfully Big Adventure and then Sense and Sensibility (or the other way around).He shows he has range,at least enough to play Gilderoy Lockhart in the second Harry Potter film.God please,if he screws that up I won't forgive him!
