Oh, how my heart just goes aflutter when I see my Gene. I am an absolute old movie nut. I've see pretty much every single movie that Gene Kelly was in and loved pretty much all of them. My second favorite(One of my favorite movies of all time period.) Was Singin in the Rain. He was amazing in the whole Broadway Melody segment, as is he in all his movies. This one especially though. My favorite Gene Kelly movie,though, was The Pirate with Judy Garland. In his big dance scene in this movie he is frolicking about in these little short shorts that make him just so delicious. He and Judy Garland have such chemistry, which makes their other movies Me and My Gal and Summer Stock very entertaining to watch. Both his acting and singing as well are notable, which is impressive considering that he studyed to be a dancer, not a singer or actor. There are not enough words to describe my love for this man. He's opened heaven's portal here on Earth for this poor mortal...(Singin in the Rain)
