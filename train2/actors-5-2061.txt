I truly love Anthony Hopkins, as far back as the early movies such as Elephant man Magic. He is a remarkable actor and wish that i can meet him in person some day. It would be a most memorable moment in my life. He seems to be very down to earth and a truly good person at heart. Thank you Anthony Hopkins, Loretta K Piketon, Ohio
