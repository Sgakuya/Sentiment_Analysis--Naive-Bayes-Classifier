Some people say that Las Vegas' over-the-top tackiness makes it interesting - I say it's just a huge, surreal eyesore. From the slot machines at the gates of the airport, to the cab drivers who say New York, New York's roller coaster is the best ride in town since the hookers were kicked off the strip, to the casino's that are so cavernous you can't find an exit - am I the only person thinking of fire exits? I didn't bet a single quarter - the families in the casinos at 11:00 pm were to depressing to contemplate. It kills me that this is one of the top destination-vacations in the US.
