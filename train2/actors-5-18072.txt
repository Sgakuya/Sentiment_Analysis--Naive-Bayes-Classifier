Ah, the great love story of Sharon and Nick on Y R... is there a better soap opera couple? Sharon (the character) is probably one of the nicest people you could meet in real life, not to mention, probably THE sweetest soap opera woman EVER. May she and Nick always stay together on Y R... Sharon (the character) is also the mother of two children, including the adorable Cassie. Add all this to the fact that she's one of the most gorgeous women of daytime TV and... simply put, she's unbelievable!
