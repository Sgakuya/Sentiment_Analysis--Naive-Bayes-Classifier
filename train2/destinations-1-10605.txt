This funny feeling in my throat reminds me of when I had my tonsils removed 2 years ago. It feels as if I swallowed sand paper. Truly one of the more disgusting cigarettes I have ever tasted. My wife got a carton of these from a rep. They were the organic blend. I think organic just meant they were blended with dirt and tigs.
