This is the worst system I've ever seen. What the hell does a game system need with a hard drive, anyway? None of its games have anything on gamecube games (Super Smash Bros. Melee, Mario Sunshine, and so on). The only idiots who should buy this are the people who want to pay a hell of a lot more for worse graphics, crappy controllers, and a completly pointless hard drive.
