Toni Collete has what so many other actors lack -- true talent and the ability to play someone other than herself. Her ability to change her physical appearance as well as her accent, etc., makes her a treat to watch. Every time I know she's going to be in a film, I make sure I see it! (And I was pleasantly surprised to see her playing a small supporting role in The Hours. ) I hope she's given another lead role soon!
