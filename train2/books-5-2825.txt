EXCELLENT, thought-provoking, intelligent book! I think what I love most about this work is Mr. Diamond's treatment of VARIOUS cultures and peoples, and his disproving of racist explainations as to why some peoples have come to dominate, exterminate or displace others. He views ALL people as equal, and shows that chance and accident CAN have a huge affect on history and culture. If you like to think about the whys and hows of things, then this book is for you!
