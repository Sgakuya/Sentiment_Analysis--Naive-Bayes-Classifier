REALLY don't see what people see in Maurice. Perhaps it is the character he plays. I'm just not into the dark characters. He mumbles. I hate his greasy looking hair. And I absolutely can not stand the holier than thou attitude of Sonny. I feel there is enough hate in the world. We watch soaps for entertainment. If we want real life we'll watch the news.
