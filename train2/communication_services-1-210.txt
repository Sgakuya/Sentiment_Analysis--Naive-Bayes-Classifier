I had service with them for many years. It took forever to get help when needed after verizon took over. Calls were dropped and service interrupted. When you call customer service you get a different answer to the same question. It didnt seem like anyone was trained properly. I finally cancelled my service in December and wrote a letter to customer service on December 15th. It is now into February and they never even responded. I will do without cellular service before I go back to Verizon!
