[To EVRYBODY AND MAGELLAN in particular) - Jason Isaacs is remarkable ACTOR! I noticed him well before PATRIOT came and was on his support list long before many newborn american fans joined. Well. I want to stress he is ACTOR versus STAR. You can be a smaller star but INCREDIBLE actor, whilst you can be a huge HOLLYWOOD MEGASTAR aka Stallone, but a sh!t waiste of acotor. IMHO Stallone is not an actor- he does not act - he just runs/fires/kicks @ss but not act - just star. This is huge difference. Even Sean Penn who is very good actor also said that HOLLYWOOD nowadays full of stars who are sh!tty actors and cannot act. One of the REAL PROOF of acting talent is - ABILITY TO ACT ON STAGE. THIS IS PROFESSIONALISM - now tell me if you ever seen Stallone on stage - LMAO! Isaacs is a professional stage actor and a gent that neither Stallone nor Schwartzenneger can't go that far. He is just less known, but it doesn't dismiss his true talent.
