On September 11th, when many civilians, firefighters and police lay dying and badly burned, a group of firefighters burst into a Starbucks to obtain bottled drinking water for the victims. Starbucks not only wouldn't give them the water, but charged them 88 bucks for a case. I wouldn't drink a cup of Starbucks if you put a gun to my head. The corporate whores that sponsor this sort of unfeeling facism don't deserve my money- I'll drink something local or Fair Trade supported instead.
