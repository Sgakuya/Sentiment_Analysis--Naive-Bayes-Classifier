How can anyone not like him? He's so generous and kind, it's amazing. His whole life is acting, and his family. I just love that about him. I'm telling you, the guy can't get any better. :) He did a terrific job in What Dreams May Come . No one else could have performed the part so beautifully, may I say. Anyway, he's awesome, and that will never change.
