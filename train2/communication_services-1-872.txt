Telus does not value their customers. After my 2 year phone contract was up, I was offered deals that were worse than for new customers. The only option to upgrade my phone was a 3 year contract, which is unacceptable by todays standard. I tried to cancel, but was passed from reps to reps who wouldn't let me cancel because they weren't sure of my idenity even though I provided them with all of the proper identification. HORRIBLE. NEVER BUY FROM TELUS!
