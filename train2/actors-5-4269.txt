You have to give credit to a guy who made it big, fell off the radar screen after several really bad movies, then reinvented himself and launched a successful comeback. With the exceptions of Perfect, Battlefield Earth, The Experts, and a few other clinkers, Travolta is one of the best all around actors in films today. My mom grew up with James Bridges, the guy who directed him in Urban Cowboy, and he says that John is a very generous and friendly person in real life. I have read accounts from various regular people who have had similar things to say about him.
