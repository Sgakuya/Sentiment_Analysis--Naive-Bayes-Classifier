I don't think this woman can act her way out of a paper bag. She used to be pretty-and if she's not careful she is going to be the female Michael Jackson. I am not jealous, anyone can buy extra body parts. I actually feel sorry for her. But in her own rite, she is rich and famous and that is all she stands for. What else has she done? I am glad I do not have a 13 year old daughter who looks at Pam as a serious role model.
