An Actress who by far had all the attributes on the screen almost as if the camera admired her. She wasn't THE best actress of her time, but she definitely possessed that X-Factor that very few performers and public figures possess that makes them what they are. Her beauty emulated on the screen as well as her grace, poise and mannerism's. There truly will never ever be another Audrey Hepburn as she was by far one in a million.
