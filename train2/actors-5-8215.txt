A truly fine, fine actress who played timid and shy characters (JANE EYRE, REBECCA), an evil murderess in IVY, her portrayal of a sexy WAAF in THIS ABOVE ALL is terrific, a temptress in BORN TO BE BAD is awesome, and her lively performances in FRENCHMAN'S CREEK and FROM THIS DAY FORWARD are great. Her crowning achievements, in my opinion, were in REBECCA and the marvelous LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN. I could mention many other roles in which she was absolutely enchanting but will stop here. She is one of the greats of the Golden Age of film.
