I do alot of reading, and Christopher Moore has become one of my most favorite authors. And much of the reason for this is this book, the first I have read by him. The action takes place in a seacoast town where most of the population sees the local shrink. After one of his patients apparently commits suicide, the doctor decides to take the town off its medication and give them placeabos instead. The plan works well until an anciet sea lizard comes ashore and the townsfolf become slowly depressed again. Hilarity insues. I know this sounds like a stupid sci-fi plot, it is not. Moore skillfully tells the tale in a way where you come to know and appreciciate the charecters, even the Sea Lizard. Wildly funny and totaly unpredictable, this book is a page turner you won't want to put down.
