Gillian Anderson is a very underated actress. She is so much more than agent Scully. She was brilliant in The House of Mirth, The Mighty Celt and Bleak House. I was also lucky enough to see her on stage in The Sweetest Swing in Baseball and it was an incredible experience. I am very much looking forward to her upcoming performances in The Last King of Scotland and Straightheads.
