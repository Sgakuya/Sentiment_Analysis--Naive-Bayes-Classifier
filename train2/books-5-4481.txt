I have a hard time choosing my favorite Hemingway book. It either this one, Old Man and the Sea, or The Sun Also Rises. Each one is brilliant in its own way, but I think you can make a strong argument that For Whom the Bell Tolls is the best. The language is tight and forceful, the characters are real and complex, and the story pulls you in from the first few pages. This book is set during the Spanish Civil War in 1937, and the protagonist is Robert Jordan, an ex-teacher who is now a demolitions expert charged with blowing up a bridge. I vividly remember some of the passages that describe Jordan falling in love with Maria, a beautiful woman he meets while teaming up with a band of guerrillas. For Whom the Bell Tolls is somehow both sad and hopeful, and it leaves a lasting impression.
