The service and coverage is terrible. I would like to know what state the people who rated it good or great live in. I doubt if they live in Southern California. There are so many holes in Nextel's coverage in this area that the phone is useless in some areas. If you call to let them know about the poor service they always have excuses but they never fix the problems.
