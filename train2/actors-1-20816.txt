I used to really admire Sarah Jessica Parker but my opinion has changed. I now think she is selfish, stupid, and heartless. If any of her family is accepting support from the government she should be ashamed of herself and she is not worthy of all she has achieved. If I was worth millions I would share it all with my family and friends. What good is money if you don't let anyone in. Not all families are created equal. But please visit Rush Limbaugh's web site to find what she is quoted as saying. It's disgusting and sickenly elitest. She's not as smart as she seems!
