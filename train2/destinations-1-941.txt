The cradle of civilization? Don't think so. Andreas Papandreou, born in America, was a TRAITOR to my country. The Greeks can have the dude. Socialist extroardinaire. Long history of mousiness in the face of overwhelming odds. Military dictatorships. Greek olives have PITS in them! What kind of Mediterranean conspiracy IS that?!? Feta cheese is more like foot-a cheese. Mountainous. Poor soil and wretchedly poor goatherders in my opinion. Can't even get along with Turks or Bulgarians, or Macedonians, or even Albanians. No wonder they emigrated...to AMERICA, BAY-BEE!!!!!
