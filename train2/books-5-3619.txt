I would urge anyone to read and more importantly listen to Hamlet. Shakespeare is as relevant today as then.That said, it is sometimes difficult to get the full meaniing of the prose . To realize the full beauty of Hamlet or any Shakespeare for that matter, you need to listen to it,or read it, more than once. Each time it gets better.
