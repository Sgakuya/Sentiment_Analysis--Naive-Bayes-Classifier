Possibly my favorite book of all time. Wharton has a deft and humorous touch in this novel; it's understandable why she won the Pulitzer prize. Her characters come alive as well as the Old New York setting that they live in. Her knowledge of the era in which she lived and wrote is obvious. The movie with Daniel Day Lewis is a must see.
