Brilliant actor! He shines in every film he's made. Yes, he could be more selective with the films he choses to make, but with a body of work like his there are plenty of first-rate films. For those who think of him as Lex Luther, please take a look at Scarecrow, The Conversation, and Unforgiven -- his performances will give you chills (in a good way).
