William Faulkner's writing grew increasinly esoteric and modernist as he aged. This novel being a latter work, it is very difficult reading as the author jumps through time and between the minds of his troubled characters. An interesting outlook on the human psyche and a unique piece of writing that can be classified as a work of art.
