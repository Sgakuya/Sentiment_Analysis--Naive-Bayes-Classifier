This woman was pure magic. She practically glowed on film. The voice, the sex appeal, the vulnerability, the dumb blond persona--it all worked. The end result was an unforgettable actress. She must have been a good actress because people confused the persona with the real person. With all her problems, addictions, etc., Marilyn was not as dumb as she pretended to be. She actually worked hard to perfect that persona and ended up being victimized by it. Even though she is no longer with us, she will always be embeddied in American culture.
