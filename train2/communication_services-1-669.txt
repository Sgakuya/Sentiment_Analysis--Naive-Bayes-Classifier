I would never trust Cingular again. Paid $127 for a prepaid plan that came with 300 free minutes and a chintzy Motorola phone that didn't work when trying to call my mother only one mile away; nor could the phone be left on for incoming because it required recharging every few hours. The 300 free minutes simply vanished after about a week or so although I only used perhaps 10 of them. Rip off. Lost more minutes when I purchased additional prepaid cards.
