I have been with Nextel for over 5 years and their customer service is a joke! They are rude and say they do not make mistakes. It is impossible to get them to correct their mistake. For the last 6 months they have been carrying over direct connect minutes from my previous bill to my new bill. I have called them over 25 times and they have yet to fix the problem. I would not advise anyone to do business with them.
