I love Ashley Judd. She's a rare beauty who reminds me of a cross between Elizabeth Taylor and Jacqueline Kennedy - a role I would love to see her play and bet she could pull off with ease. Her acting is surperb and her contributions and hard work to the Youth Aids Foundation are incredible. I could do without some of the arrogance and vulgarity, but looking beyond that, I think she's great.
