I saw her on David Letterman recently, and she was so rude, so 'upset' that people probed into her private life, excuse me, but she got a acting job, she got on a successful series (she could have quit mid-way thru), she gets a million bucks a week, she lives with Brad Pitt in a $15 million mansion, of course people are going to probe, she is the one who seeked all of the above out,and now she complains and is rude? Well, guess I won't subject her to any of this probing stuff anymore, won't tune into Friends, not even for the last show, and certainly won't pay to watch any more of her movies! Why make the poor girl suffer?????
