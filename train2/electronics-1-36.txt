I have owned two Sharp camcorders. The first had to be repaired 4 times. I finally gave up on it and bought their digital camcorder. I have had it two years and it is having problems now too. I love the features and layout with the 4 inch screen in the back but I can't believe the reliability problems. I think I will buy a Sony next time.
