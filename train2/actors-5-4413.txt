I love Jason Isaacs and his work. He is such a great actor and is so versitile in all of his roles, i mean going from a revolutionary war hero (some people saw talington like that) to a drag queen? he is wonderful in everything that he does even when the script isnt so good, but he works it and he works it well. those of u who dont like him are entitled to your opinion, but theres no denying he has great presence on stage and screen and is on his way to becoming a full-fledged super star.
