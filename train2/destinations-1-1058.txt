Dingoes, sheep, didgeridoos, brush fires, and no one speaks real AMERICAN English. Australian rules football is kinda cool, but pales in comparison to AMERICAN football! You know, if you look at a map of Australia on its side, it looks like a profile of Adolf Hitler or Charlie Chaplin, with Arnhem Land the nose, and Cape York Peninsula the lower jaw and lip. Whoa. Too laid -back. No worries, they say. Yeah right. They've gotta be more aggressive 'cuz it's a hard-bitten world out there. AMERICA, BAY-BEE!!!!
