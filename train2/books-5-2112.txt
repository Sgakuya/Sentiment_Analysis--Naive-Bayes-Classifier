You can go to a dull old museum and view the female figure undraped in painting or sculpture, or you can see page after page of photorealism, and be entertained to boot by some retro time traveling with Kurtzman and Elder's Little Annie Fanny. Ample Annie ends up parted from her clothes reminiscent of Jane, from the 40's in WWII. The combination of on-target satire, remarkable caricatures of famous folk of all ilks, and fine drawing is sure to have you turning pages, but slowly, as each one contains clever interplay in backgrounds. Eyestrain is a minor annoyance.
