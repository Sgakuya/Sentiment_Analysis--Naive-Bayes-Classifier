I believe it shows how easily people will ignore their own instincts and refuse to belive they are weak willed enough to be the victim of plots or brainwashing or other methods of programing... but they still run out to buy Nike's and every new Disney toy before the movie has even been released. Everyone is a victim of some scam or other whether it is Madison Avenue, Political, or Religious. And False Memory is a threat to their safety zones.
