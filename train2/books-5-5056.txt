It's easy to poke fun at a romantic epic that methodolically lays out an entire philosophy of the world. But Rand pulls it off with an engrossing story and dead-on insights about the nature of civilization. I'm baffled by smart people who mistake her individualism for its polar opposite: totalitarianism; or who see her personal flaws as reasons to dislike a profoundly great book.
