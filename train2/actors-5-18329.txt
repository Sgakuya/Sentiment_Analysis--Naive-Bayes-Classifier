Some of Hitchcock's movies actually bore me, but I can't deny that he is one of the most innovative directors of our time. His use of camera angles and filming techniques revolutionized the film industry. He definitely captured horror without the blood and guts and captivated his audience. Hitchcock films are timeless classics that will be enjoyed for years to come.
