She reminds me of the crack addicted prostitutes that were once so prevalent in the streets of New York City. There is nothing special about her or her acting which is really lousy. She was fine in Girl Uninterrupted because she was playing the same type of lunatic person that she really is. The only reason she is in Hollywood is because of her movie star father and that is it. Anyone who rates her anything higher than 2 stars needs to have their heads examined. Better movie stars than Angelina can be found at your local psychiatric ward. She looks as gross as anything seen in The Night of the Living Dead.
