Kathy is a truly great actress and also a director. Just saw the new rental UNCONDITIONAL LOVE and it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I didn't know Kathy could sing so well! Also loved her in Dolores Claiborne and Misery, but all the shows she does are wonderful - even HBO's Six Feet Under. Hope she wins all kinds of awards.
