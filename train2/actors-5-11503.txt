She's got balls and is not afraid of telling it like it is. I admire her for her talent, her honesty and her willingness to put herself out there in the face of all the spitefulness evident in the comments here. I've been a fan since I was a kid - Cher is a popular icon. And as for the people commenting here that are so intolerant they can't stand to hear an opionion different from their own, THAT'S WHAT WE DO IN THIS COUNTRY! REMEMBER?!
