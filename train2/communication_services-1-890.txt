I purchased a Samsung A660 phone at Staples. I also purchased a $25.00 Recharge Card (Fastcard) which was a big mistake. I activated the phone but could not get the recharge card to work because of "so called technical difficulties". I had to wait on line for customer service to answer over a 1/2 hour each time. Most of the representatives do not speak English clearly. It is now 2 days, and they still keep saying "technical difficulties" with the database for the Fastcard. I was told I could buy another card (not Fastcard), and it would work. It sounds like a scam to me. Once you've scraped off the pin, you can't return the card that doesn't work. I notified Staples (they don't seem to care), and also complained to the FCC. I would not get involved with STI Mobile again. It is not worth the time and aggravation.
