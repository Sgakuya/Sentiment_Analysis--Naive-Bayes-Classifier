Unfortunately, there isn't a strong enough word in the English dictionary to describe my feelings for Diaz - though detest is close, airhead is another. She can't act, she's far from attractive (although she just LOVES to tell all and sundry how beautiful she THINKS she is) and she's downright annoying. Throw her to the dogs - NOW!
