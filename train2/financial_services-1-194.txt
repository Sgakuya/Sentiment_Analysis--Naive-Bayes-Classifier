The bad ratings for this bank are no joke, they have THE worst customer service possibly of any bank, let alone any business at all. I have to deal with them through my work, I myself do not have an account with them, get real, lol. They must put their service reps through some special training to be that rude, uncaring and uninformed, noone could be like that naturally.
