I don't know anyone who wasn't born there who could possibly value this state. If not for Alabama and mississippi it would easily be the worst state in the U.S.A. I can't be believe these bible-thumping bumpkins who have suffered more economically than any other state in this country could vote to reelect this dimwit Bush as president. The only silver lining is that they almost assuredly will continue to fall of the face of the earth becuase of their choice.
