A fascinating director that has films, for the most part, can be watched over and over. I think its a shame that the films have aspects that date them. A lot of set pieces and special effects are laughable now and keep a lot of young viewers from seeing the true genius of his work. There is no better story teller in the history of cinema that reached so many.
