I have been fighting with this bank for a year about a charge that was not mine and they have no documentation to show authorization. It appears it is easier to bill there customers than charge back their vendors when there is an even obvious mystake. Don't worry about their claims of credit reporting. A letter to your loan officer explaining the problem was enough for me. Seems they know of the problem with this bank and a couple others. DO NOT PAY charges that are not yours! It's time for the credit bureaus to take notice and crack down on these kind of banks for bad reporting.
