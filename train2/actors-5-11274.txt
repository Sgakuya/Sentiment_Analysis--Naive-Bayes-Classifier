I have yet to see a really bad movie with Christina Ricci in it...I especially loved the movie titled THE OPPOSITE OF SEX..she was way above all the other stars in that movie...Christina Ricci will someday get the perfect movie role...in the meantime it is great seeing her in the work she does now...superb talent...
