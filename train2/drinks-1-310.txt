I don't understand why this beer got so many 5 star ratings. This stuff is nasty as hell, it is strong beer which I like, but it isn't even a dark beer, so that = nasty In order for a really strong tasting beer to be good it has to be dark. Grolsch is pretty nasty stuff, it may be good for cleaning a sink or something, but not for drinking that is for sure. I hate Budweiser beer with a passion,I always have and I can drink it all day over Grolsch it is %100 better and it's nasty also. Here read up kiddies. Let me give you tips, I will tell you what good beer is. Guiness (on Tap) Samual Smith (oatmil stout) Samual Smith (taddy porter) Pete's wicked ale New Castle Any of these are great beers.
