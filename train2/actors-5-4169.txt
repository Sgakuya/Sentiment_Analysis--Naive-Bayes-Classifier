By his own admission he has appeared in a lot of stinkers over the years but he has performed well in everything and he's been on a winning streak for the last 10 years. I assume he is at a place where he is considering his legacy and only will work in well made films with a message. I think he should be in a league with De Niro and Pacino as one of the greats of his generation.
