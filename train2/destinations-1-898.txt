Dry. Brown. The Ebro is incredibly polluted. Shades of the fascist Franco still abound in certain cities. They seem to have this problem with the Basques (as do the French). The Balearic Islands are tourist traps and are frequented by pale northern Europeans striving for that swarthy Mediterranean look. Madrid is frenetic and too populated for me. They need to stop taking all those siestas and learn to wait on Americans the right way, which is the AMERICAN way. Bull-running in Pamplona? Don't think so. That's plain idiocy. The rain in Spain is water on their brain.
