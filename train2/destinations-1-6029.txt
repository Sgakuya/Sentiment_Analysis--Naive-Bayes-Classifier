This state predicates most of its economy on in migration- meaning real estate and all its related economic engines have helped the state boom- when the AZ housing bubble crashes- I would not want to be the one of many holding the stick. Yes Phoenix is way too hot, crowded, expensive, polluted and crime infested- I enjoyed Tucson far better- and loved Sedona. However the state is headed for an economic disaster in the next few years- along with the water problem- its not so great a place to be down and out in.
