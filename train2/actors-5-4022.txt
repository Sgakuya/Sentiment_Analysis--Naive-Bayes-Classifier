Definitely one of my favourite actors, right up there with the likes of Anthony Hopkins. Besides being a master of the acting craft, I truly enjoy his films on a whole... he chooses great projects. My favourite performance is by far Oscar Hopkins in Oscar and Lucinda. It's absolutely brilliant! I have yet to see a stage performance of his, however, and can only imagine how spectacular his Shakespearean stage performances are.
