Man the double stuff is like crack..... why oh why do they have to take a good classic like oreos or reese's peanut butter and start messing around like inside out and other unappetizing combinations? EDIT: I just bought a package of double stuff for the first time since they reduced the size of the package, and I find there isn't the same amount of stuff in the middle as before, and when I try to twist them apart, the cookie part broke every time. It wasn't stale or anything, it just was not the same as it used to be. I have reduced the score from 5 to 1 because of this. Very highly disappointed.
