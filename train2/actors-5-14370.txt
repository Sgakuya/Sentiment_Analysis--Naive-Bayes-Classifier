Great talent. And the Iraqis were celebrating the overthrow of Saddam, NOT welcoming Americans. Already thousands of Iraqis were protesting US presence in Iraq and pledging resistence. And by the way, we're the children that were burned alive by US bombs celebrating? Were the hundreds of suicide bombers preparing to attack the US celebrating? Were the new Al-Queda recruits, which thanks to our invasion there is plenty of, celebrating? Were the thousands in coffins and in the hosiptals celebrating? You know, the people YOU DONT see on CNN or Fox News Perhaps if we did not impose crippling sanctions on the Iraqi people and make them dependent on Saddam for their survival, they WOULD have done it earlier... But I guess thats too much thinking for mindless patriots with their go-git-em emphlosophy. Its amazing how one person jumped from Pearl Harbor to 9 11, as if America was not overthrowing gov's all, some democratically elected, installing and supporting ruthless dictators all over the world, responsible for the deaths of millions, etc. Its always Oh NO, they attacked US! We had NOTHING to do with it. Check out the HUNDREDS of US military interventions, unprovoked, since WWII if you want to know the truth behind the motivations of 9 11. If you're not braindead from watching TV yet.
