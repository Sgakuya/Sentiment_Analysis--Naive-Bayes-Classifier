Dorothy Lamour was a legendary star of the first rank, but was terribly underrated as such. Besides being an unusual beauty, she could sing, dance a little, and yes, she could act. Of all the so called glamour girls of the period, Dorothy was by far the most versatile not limited to just the sarong movies and the Road pictures. She played in musicals, comedies, dramas, costumers, and earned stardom in her very first movie The Jungle Princess, plus perhaps Paramount's all time top box office female star during the Golden Age of movies.
