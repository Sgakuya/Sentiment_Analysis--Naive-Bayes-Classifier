Meryl is one of the classiest ladies in Hollywood, I mean class, not glamour! She is a great actor, secure with who she is, chooses her movies wisely and made the best move, ) yes, m o v e, not m o v i e) in her life when she left Hollywood - she is too classy a lady for tinsel town. She is no phony and she is not a groupie or collective thinker so she can fit in with the in-crowd and whatever the latest cause is! She thinks for herself!
