Jim Carrey is a great man... He's the only guy that can move his face like that, shake his body like that, do voices and noises like that, he's the best comedian ever, he's mind is a jungle, but he also is smart, The Trumans show, genius role!, Man on the Moon, great!, doh me, myself and Irene, Jim himself was funny, it was the movie that wasn't that good, anyway, he showed what young people of today are asking, how do you excpect from Carrey not trying this if you see that American Pie is a succes, anyway, hi's next movie Bruce Allmighty will be great :D
