Ms. Bancroft was such a talented, beautiful actress and I will miss her. It is sad to hear of her death and we need to pray for her dear husband, Mel Brooks. Anne was fabulous in Miracle Worker and won her Academy Award for her portrayal of Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. She performed in so many movies, plays and TV programs and was always first class. If you saw The Slender Thread, Fatso and so many other films that she did, you will agree that she was awesome!
