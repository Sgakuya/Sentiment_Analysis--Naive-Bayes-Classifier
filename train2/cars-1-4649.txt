All I have to say is drive them all. Drive the Toyota, Dodge, Ford and Chevy/GMC....put all to the test, I did. And once again GM proved why it's the best, and why Motor Trend gave the Silverado and HD highest honors. Ford, throw a load in the back and step on the gas and all it gives you is a What? response. You just can't ask it to do any work, just a nice ride on the highway. Dodge, yea the new one, still looks like a truck (on the outside) that says work me but it still has the old 'DOG' engine and trans....and we all know about that combo. And what's up with the 'Minvan' dash? Toyota, nice in 4x4 but don't ask it to be a daily driver, very uncomfortable and no power. The Chevy just did everything better, nice ride on both the highway and in 4x4, strong engine...when you hit the gas it jumps and forget about that load of wood in the back, the strong 5.3 can't tell it's there. Last of all it has room in the ex-cab for full size people.
