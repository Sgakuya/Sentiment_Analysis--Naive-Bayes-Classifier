I absolutely love Lucille. She was so funny, and had perfect timing. Her show paved the way for other sitcoms. It was wholesome, definitely something kids could watch, but it also contained good humor at the same time. Lucy Ricardo was always so sneaky, and always including her loyal sidekick, Ethel, in her schemes.
