I have always thought of Denzel as being one of the best black male actors we have. But he said something on the John Sally evening talk show aired on BET. It was during the time he was promoting the movie Training Day, He stated that he's married to a real black woman, not a light-skin black woman but you know what I mean a dark real black woman. Now after hearing him speak in this manner it puts a cloud over his head for me. I feel that he should openly apologize to light-skin women of color. I'm one of those women so are my children. Where does he get off thinking that his wife is a real black woman because she's darker than me. This is what I call racism among our on race. These are the type of comments I had to deal with while growing up. He's always thanking God. What would Jesus think about his comment? And as far as I'm concerned a man of God should not be making these types of comments anyway. I will still watch his movies but because of what he said on the John Sally show it caused me not to be as happy as I would have been when he excepted his Oscar. He need to remember that all women of color supported him. Because I have always been a strong supporter of Denzel, just ask my husband. I'm writing this because I think it is important for people to realize the power of speech. I Hope this get back to Denzel and his family. Because I know I have to forgive and move on. But this is no way to treat your fans. Keep making good movies Denzel!
