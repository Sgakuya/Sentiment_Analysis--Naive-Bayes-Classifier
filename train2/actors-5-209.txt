Burt Landcaster was a classically-trained Hollywood actor. When watching his actual films, he doesn't comes off as a mere screen personality re-playing himself in each and every film (a la Cary Grant). Neither does he come off as a mere actor mimicing a script or role. His acting's not only highly believible, it trancends the ordinary. Just a sample of great films I've seen of his are: The Rose Tattoo, The Swimmer, Come Back Little Sheeba and Birdman of Alcatraz.
