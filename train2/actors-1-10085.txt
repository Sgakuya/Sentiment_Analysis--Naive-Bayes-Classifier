Let's see... In Private Benjamin, she played a spoiled rich girl who had wacky misadventures with common people in the army. In Overboard, she played a spoiled rich girl who had wacky misadventures with a common guy and his kids. In Bird On A WIre, she played a spoiled rich girl who had wacky misadventures with a common guy on the run from the Feds. Oh yeah, she's a really versatile actress. Been there done that, already sold the T-shirt at a garage sale to someone who cares.
