Look, these books were incredible, but they WERE NOT HORROR at all! This doesn't belong in the horror section any more than Flannery O'Connor's A Good Man Is Hard To Find does. This is certainly one of King's best efforts to date. He seems to write much better books when he strays from the horror trappings over the past ten years or so. He's just a damn good storyteller.
