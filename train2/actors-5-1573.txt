This gentleman is a class act all the way---and an incredibly talented actor as well. The consummate professional---his performance in Nurse Betty was the equivalent of watching a finely tuned instrument....tight, taut and mesmerizing to watch, and capable of making the most beautiful music! I am hopeful he will earn an Oscar sooner rather than later---he already deserves it based on his body of work to date.
