I drove one once, and I felt like I was driving a go-cart. I had to hunch over to keep from hitting my head, and even with the seat all the way back there was no leg room, and the steering wheel was between my knees. I want good gas mileage as much as anyone, but you can't sacrifice all comfort to get it.
