Everything that has ever mattered in motion pictures has owed atleast some influence to Alfred Hitchcock. It is very rare to discover a man who could both make very complex movies and still know what his audience wants. I think Steve Spielberg is the only other, but as good as he is, Hitchcock is many times more skilled at the craft. Hitchcock is my inspiration to go ahead and make movies myself. Films like VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO NOTORIOUS hold a unique place in film history. You cannot classify them as horror nor can you classify them as suspense films, because basically, Hitchcock owns that genre of film! They are simply Hitchcock films, it's as simple as that.
