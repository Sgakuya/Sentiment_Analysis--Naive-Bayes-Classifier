For those young enough to only remember Sir Alec in Star Wars , you need to grow up! This man could do anything in British cinema. His comedies are wonderful. He played spy-catchers, bumbling crooks, British officers, foreign dignitaries, sniveling clerks. His work in Great Expectations, The Ladykillers, The Man in the White Suit, and Captain's Paradise will always make me laugh. But I will most remember him for The Horse's Mouth. He was one of the greats.
