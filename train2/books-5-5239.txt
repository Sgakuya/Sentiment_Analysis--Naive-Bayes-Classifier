White Oleander is the story of Astrid, a fatherless girl whose mother is jailed for murder. We follow Astrid from foster home to foster home, each a new world for her to absorb. This book focuses on the intricate relationships mothers and daugters have, and the struggle Astrid goes through to find her own identity. Most enjoyable about this book is Janet Fitch's rich narative. This is a great read.
