Jealousy will never get you anywhere (speaking to the females who like to bash Pam). This gal is one of the coolest in entertainment history. Listen to all these people,on tv and so forth who knows her. Look at her demeanor and personality. Pam is the bomb. She rocks. Forget how hot she is,shes incredibly appealing personality-wise. And she does well,within her limitations of acting. She has played her roles very nicely. She isnt trying to be Jodie Foster or someone. She isnt going for an oscar! She is the Marilyn Monroe of this generation!
