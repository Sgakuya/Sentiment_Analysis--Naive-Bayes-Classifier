An absolutely fantastic book. It has a lot of various emotions expressed, such as humor, hatred, fear and you can really empathise with characters such as Martini and The Chief. It really does make you think about how people can be treated if they are not 'normal' by society's strandards. I was impressed with the film as well, it followed the book the best it could, which is quite rare!
