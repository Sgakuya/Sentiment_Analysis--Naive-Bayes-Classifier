Still having all sorts of problems since they incorporated the former DDR. Taxes are among the highest in Europe. That guttural accent of theirs grates on my nerves. Schooling is too rigid. Their beer is OK, but not as good as AMERICAN beer. Their flag colors are pathetic. Yellow? YELLOW?!? NAh--RED WHITE AND BLUE!!! AMERICA, BAY-BEE!!!!
