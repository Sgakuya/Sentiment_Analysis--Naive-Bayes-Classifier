It's unusual to come across a book that draws you in so quickly and delivers a powerful punch without feeling heavy-handed. Hesse is a master here at posing philosophical questions in the context of an interesting story. In some ways, Siddhartha reminded me of an adult version of The Velveteen Rabbit. If you're in the mood for a meaning of life book, and you enjoy good storytelling, you'll appreciate Siddhartha.
