I was never a big Spree fan. It seems that everyone was eating these in High School..what's up with that? Everyone seemed to have that long foiled tube of multi colored disks hanging out of their bag. The never did anything for me..they weren't very flavorful and the texture annoyed me a bit. I like hard candy, but I need that smooth texture of the Jolly Rancher rather than the gritty coating that the Spree took on once it has been in your mouth for 7 seconds. Yuck, get a bag of Jolly Ranchers.
