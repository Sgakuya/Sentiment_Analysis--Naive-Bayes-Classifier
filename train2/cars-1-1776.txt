The only reason the Cavalier continues to sell is because of heavy discounting and sales to fleets and rental car companies. I can't imagine anyone who would bypass the Civic and the Corolla for this ancient outclassed piece of junk. If the Cavalier is all you can afford then by all means go ahead and buy one. No wait. Actually, I think a used late model Japanese compact would be a better buy.
