She is gorgeous, sexy, 'evil' in the best way, formidable, and handsome in a chiseled way. Her acting is less than medicre, but it's more about how she looks and the fact that she seems like she could tempt you to do anything. She could convince you to drink snake venom, or blindfold you while she ties you up. Everyone has private fantasies about certain actresses, and the one that rapes my mind is Elizabeth in a leather teddy wearing a Mickey Mouse hat and holding a glow in the dark whip. She cuffs me to a the headpost of a soft bed and dominates me in every way. After she's done all I can do is beg for more, and she delivers. She belongs in Hollywood portraying all kinds of nasty roles and prestigious roles. I like her a lot. I'd like to see her and Lolita Davidovich make out.
