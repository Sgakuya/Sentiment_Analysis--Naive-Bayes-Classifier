Katherine is a very talented actress, which can be best seen in her role in 'young americans'. the storyline she was involved in seemed to start as the subplot of the story, but soon took over the show (i know i watched it for her and ian somerhalder). it is obvious from her performance in 'young americans' that she takes acting seriously - she must have researched her role thoroughly to pull off such a difficult part - i hope she does well in the future - she deserves to!
