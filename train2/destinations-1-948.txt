Contrary to the movies and BBC, the Brits are Ugly Brutish People... especially the women! The native food is horrendous. The place is cold and damp, and the only redeeming value is that they have some culture (compared to Americans). Although, even this is quickly lost to the fact that they are trying soooo hard to emulate the USA.
