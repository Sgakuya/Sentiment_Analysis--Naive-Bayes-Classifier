I don't give a sh*t about his personality or off-screen antics. Russell is a phenomenal actor, and he becomes whatever character he is playing onscreen. I can never see him acting like I can with Tom Hanks, he's not merely churning out a performance with lots of actorly tics. He simply IS the character.
