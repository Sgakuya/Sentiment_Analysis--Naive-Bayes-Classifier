Certainly, the most under-appreciated of all film makers. Although primarily reverred for his horror films, James Whale imbued the genre with a richness that very few horror directors can or have. BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is certainly one of the most important works of cinema history, if you ask me and James Whale is one of my all-time favorite film makers.
