He has immense talent. Some of the movies i have liked best are done from him. He has a wonderful imagination. I loved E.T., The Color Purple, Jaws, Close Encounters of the third kind, and Schindlers list won him his well deserved Oscar. He should have won one before that. It seems he had a lot of years being snubbed by the often snobby Hollywood. I expect he will continue to direct some more great movies for years to come.
