This comic strip was good at one point in time. There used to be continuing stories and recurring characters (such as Nermal or Jon's family) that kept things interesting. Now this is one of the lamest comic strips in the newspaper. It's like watching a sports superstar, long past his prime, playing for a really bad expansion team. There is literally no variety in the contents of this comic strip: Monday: Garfield smashes a spider. Tuesday: Jon can't get a date. Wednesday: Garfield watches TV. Thursday: Garfield smashes a spider. Friday: Jon can't get a date. Saturday: Garfield watches TV. Sunday: Garfield smashes a spider in front of Jon and his date, in COLOR. Oof.
