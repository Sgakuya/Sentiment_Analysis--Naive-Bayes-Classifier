only good if you're a pharmacy student! incredibly high tuition (even though our chancellor is among the best paid in the private sector with a salary of $977,827) ...all our money seems to be spent on improving aesthetic quality of campus (adding brick designs, decorative signs, moving statues, fountains, ice sculptures) and not the infrastructure (i.e. buildings and dorms!)...greek life is big and the campus is high-school cliquey... everyone's a local...almost zero diversity...catholic leaders refuse to allow any sort of protests/movements/speakers on campus that are anything other than rich white men...i don't have one friend who hasn't considered transferring at least once...weak career services dept (only seems to work for business students) i'm very upset that my costly liberal arts degree probably won't even get me job interviews upon graduation. i wish i could do the whole college process again.
