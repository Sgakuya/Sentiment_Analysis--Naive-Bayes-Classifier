Being an Asian American woman, I could relate to the four stories Amy Tan tells in this book. All the Chinese legends and supersitions I have heard first hand from my mother when I was young were in the novel, which I found very heartwarming. This is great reading material for non-asian people seeking insight on Asian heritage and family life.
