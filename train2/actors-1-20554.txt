JLH doesn't need a breast reduction, she needs an ego reduction! She's just like every other young bimbo star out there (Britney Spears), showing off their breasts like the shameless tramps that they are, thinking that they're the greatest thing since sliced bread, but not intelligent enough to realize that there is more to the world that looks. I think her looks really are overrated because she is not attractive and the fact that she has to constantly flaunt her chest just proves it. Isn't it funny that the Audrey Hepburn movie didn't do so hot because they taped up her chest (to make it flat) and she actually had to rely on her talent? That's why it did so bad...she has not talent!!! Now she's starting her singing career (again) and obviously that's not going to go anywhere (like her acting career) because not only is she not attractive, but she's not talented!
