Don't use Qwest. There ARE alternatives! I have broadband at home so I switched to Vonage. It was the best decision I've made this year regarding service providers. To give you an example of how good Vonage is, not only do I get unlimited calls to US and Canada for free but I only pay 24.99/mo. I ordered a second phone line and it was working in less than 5 minutes! I also logged into my Vonage control panel and set up things like call groups and call hunting. These are features that would have taken the retarded customer service reps at Qwest months to set up for me.
