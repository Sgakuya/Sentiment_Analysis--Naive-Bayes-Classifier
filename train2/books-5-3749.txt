Wonderfully, beautiful novel. Touching and amazingly sensitive. Perfect for young kids (7th-8th graders) and adults alike. A haunting novel about racism, children, justice, power. The innocence of children amidst a complicated, unjust count scene. This novel is very special for its combination of beauty and cruelity. Unforgettable.
