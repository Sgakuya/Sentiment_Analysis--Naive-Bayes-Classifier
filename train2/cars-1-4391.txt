My family had one of these in high school and my parents never let me take it anywhere because they were always afraid it was going to break down on me, because it broke down about once a week. I have faint memories of watching my dad scream at the people at the Ford dealership. I will never ever own a Ford. Henry Ford was a tyrannical, anti-Semetic jerk who laid off thousands during the great depression and hated his employees. Also, their commercials are so G**damn stupid that I almost have to turn off the TV when they're on. This company is so out of touch with reality.
