Nothing short of brilliant. It's a real shame that Bill Waterson retired. Nothing made me laugh as consistently as Calvin and Hobbes. The characters played off of each other so well. When Calvin and Hobbes left, there was nothing to fill the void. Sure, Fox Trot is all right and Dillbert is usually bizzare and funny, but neither can compare to Calvin and Hobbes.
