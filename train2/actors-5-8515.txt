Deborah Kerr is the quintessential dramatic actress. While in no way superior to Julie Andrews in terms of singing ability (and she readily admitted to the fact that she was dubbed by Marni Nixon), she is at least on a par with Julie in terms of acting ability. Julie seemed to have problems when cast against type (or at least the movies did), Deborah is probably the most versatile actress the world has ever known. From the strong yet tender Anna Leonowens in 'The King and I' to the disillusioned and bitter yet passionate Karen Holmes in 'From Here to Eternity', Deborah brings class and elegance to any role she plays. Now, the only movie of Deborah's that I have seen and can remember is 'From Here to Eternity'. She was cast completely against type in the role of Karen when Joan Crawford pulled out, and thank god she did! This was completely in type for Joan, but Deborah brings an elegance to the role that would otherwise have been absent. One thing she is particularly good at is showing emotional pain in her eyes and face without being too 'over the top'; another is charging the screen with sexual tension (think 'The King and I', 'An Affair to Remember', and our old favorite 'From Here to Eternity'.) Deborah will go down in history as quite possibly the world's best actress.
