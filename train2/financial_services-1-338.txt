I'm A little guy I own a small auto repair shop I'm tired of paying Bank one all these fee's how are we to make a living?when all of my money gets sucks up in fees.my qwestion is why they paid a big check for thousand dollars but bounds fives little checks not totaling 500.00 dollars? WHY assholes so they can charge you overdrawth fees of 30.00 each that sucks more how come they still need 24hrs to clear cash. I walked in one day and put 850.00 in cash and they returned my checks because my cash has not cleared. if I have to baby sit my money I'm better off keeping it to myself.
