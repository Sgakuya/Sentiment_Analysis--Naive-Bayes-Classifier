I'm basing this on what I've seen so far...Man On The Moon, People Vs. Larry Flynt, and about twenty minutes of Sid and Nancy. Courtney Love is a terrific actress...she's always very convincing and part of it may be that she always seems to land the right roles. She may well be a heroin addict with a talent for wreaking havoc, but she's done some fantastic movies - wasn't she nominated for an Oscar for Larry Flynt? For the record, Courtney Love did not kill or hire someone to kill Kurt Cobain...it was a suicide. To those who persist in thinking she did - I've noticed that those in the music business who were friends with her and Kurt don't seem to think so. Take care, everyone!
