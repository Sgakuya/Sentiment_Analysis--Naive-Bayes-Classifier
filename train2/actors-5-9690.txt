The Oscar judges are like Marie-Reine Le Gougne(a corrupt figure skating judge who voted for Russians instead of the Canadians). Like Figure skating judges, they choose the winners before seeing the performance. They put popularity first instead of talent. It is a shame because Cate put a lot of effort in Elizabeth. She deserved an award. Maybe next time.
