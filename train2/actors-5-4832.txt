Jude Law is a phenomenal actor and this is just the beggining of his long and successful career. I really do believe that he will go down in history as one of the best actors to ever grace the silver screen. I realize that people may disagree with me on this would argue that Jude Law is a mediocre actor at best but those people are being quite rash in their judgement. The Talented Mr. Ripley, Enemy at the Gate and Cold Mountain (just to name a few of his more popular movies) are testement to his talent. Especially with him being the most beautifull man in Hollywood today we know hes going far.
