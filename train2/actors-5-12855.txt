Lucy Liu is not only an excellent actress, but a wonderful role model for the Asian American community. I have liked her in almost every movie she has done. And even though I hated that show Ally McBeal, I tuned in every week just to watch Lucy Liu, she made that show 100 times better than the trash it really was.....superb !
