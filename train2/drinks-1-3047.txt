To be honest this drink gives me heartburn. And to my knowledge it doesn't benefit your health. The taste is interesting, it kind of reminds me of cough syrup, and the sugar free version isn't much better. However my largest concern is the fact that i do not profit from this drink. Mostly because I have exclusive rights to XS energy drinks, That may be an unfair vote, but atleast I'm honest enough to tell it like it is, and not hide behind the fear of failure, Instead I prefer to stand in the light of truth.
