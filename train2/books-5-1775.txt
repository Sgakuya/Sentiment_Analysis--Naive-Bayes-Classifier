Walt Kelly: the greatest cartoonist ever. All cartoonists worth their salt pay homage to the man who inspired them to draw and make people think. Al Capp was perhaps his only equal with pencils and pens, but Kelly was much more subtle and compassionate beneath his slapstick. Cynical? Yes. Cutting satire? Yes. But always with a redeeming thought.
