Zimbabwe has some breathtaking natural beauty, such as the Victoria Falls-too bad that's being taken away by black poachers led by the modern African Hitler Robert Mugabe and his cronies. Let's face it- Mugabe would rather segregation rather than unity-I mean, look at the white farmers being evicted. Despite all of Mugabe's 'theft for the blacks' many blacks still remain poor. This is political racism at it's very,very worst.
