I fail to see what being a good strong liberal democrat has to do with this man's acting ability. I give him a five in spite of his liberal leanings and his TRAITOR of a daughter. The man was a class 'A' actor who made you believe he was really the person he was portraying. I wonder if you good strong liberal democrats will be as open minded.
