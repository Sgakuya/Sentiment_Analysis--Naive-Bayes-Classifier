Brandy has had a terrible carrer. She is like in nothing. She had her own TV show on UPN which was a total failure, and she played Cinderella in the made for TV 1997 version. She was in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, in which she made a total fool for herself, and ruined what seemed to have been a fairly decent made sequel.
