Tommy Lee Jones is not the best looking man in Hollywood, but he has a face that is weatherbeaten and worn, with a lot of character. Because of that there are some roles that he would not be right for. He is not a pretty-boy. He is perfect for the role of a cynical US Marshal or a tired alien investigator. Because of his limitations we should not fault him for playing similar roles, we should praise him for playing those roles better than anyone in Hollwood.
