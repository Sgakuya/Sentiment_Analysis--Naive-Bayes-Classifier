Robert Downey Jr. is the greatest actor of all time. He can play the romantic lead (Two Girls and a guy, Only You), span a lifetime for a character (Chaplin), the guy you love to hate (Soapdish), and play them equally as convincing as the other. When Robert is onscreen he is just ten time larger then everyone around him. He lets you see into his soul and that is what makes him such a one of a kind actor. And those who have worked with him have nothing but good to say. He is professional, not a prima donna. He has more talent than anyone i have ever encountered. He also has a beautiful, amazing, honest singing voice, and also composes beautiful music. He is an artist in every sense. There is only one Robert Downey Jr. in this world, and I think we are very lucky to be able to share in the magic he brings to the big or small screen, or anywhere else for that matter.
