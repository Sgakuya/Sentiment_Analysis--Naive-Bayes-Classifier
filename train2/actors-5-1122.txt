There are not enough stars to rate Tom Hanks as an actor. He is one of the best actors of our time. Forest Gump was incredible, but The Green Mile was my favorite - then, there is Saving Private Ryan, and the Philadelphia Story..there is no role Tom cannot play, none. I love him with Meg Ryan - I've Got mail was so cute. They really are good together. Tom Hanks also seems like a really nice guy. Just wish actors would stay out of the political arena, though because sometimes it is hard for me to get past those Hollywood views on things.
