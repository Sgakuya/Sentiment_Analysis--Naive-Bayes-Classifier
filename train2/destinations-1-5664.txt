I have lived in Massachusetts for six years, it is a pretty enough place but I can't stand the people here. In general I find the locals to be rude, unfriendly, and narrow-minded. Customer service is terrible, drivers are the worst I've seen anywhere and taxes are high. I will move on as soon as I am able.
