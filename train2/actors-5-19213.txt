One day i will meet matthew perry and I cant say i am absolutely in love with him because i dont know him personally but i would really like a chance to get to know him. He is the most inspirational actor and going through what he has been through takes a lot of courage. He seems like the perfect guy and i watch him every night on friends and i am sure he has girls all over him all of the time but one day he will find the right woman and we all know he deserves it. I just hope its me j/k
