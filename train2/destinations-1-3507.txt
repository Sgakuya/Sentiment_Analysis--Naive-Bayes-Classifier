The most terrible city that exists in Canada. People here have arrogant and despicable attitudes. To believe that this city actually is the`''Capital of Canada'' would even push me to move to Quebec and support seperatism. As a native maritimer, I cannot believe how dead this city is compared to the Atlantic provinces. No nightlife, no feasible attractions, no beaches... nothing... It's the biggest wasteland I've ever encountered. After living here for 5 long years, I do not blame Quebec wanting to separate from this poor excuse of a country. As for the Maritimes and the West, they should annex themselves to the U.S.A. After all, the Western provinces do not need Ottawa to guide them through their finances. Ottawa and the rest of Ontario would all do us a favour by living within their own ego-centric world and leaving the rest us alone.
