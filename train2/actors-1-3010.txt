This guy is not that good of an actor at all. All he has is a handsome old man look and a great voice. Has he evver played anything other than a smug man. I have never seen him do anything very special in his career. Yea, James Bond whatever, any ya hoo with an accent and a tux can play bond we hat(Peirce Brosnan) Connery has had an immpressive career and landed many choice roles. But he just does not cut it as an actor. Haveing a scottish accent might be sexy but it is not talent as far as acting goes.
