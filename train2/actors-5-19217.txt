Matthew is awesome! I doubt he'll ever read this, but if he does, I'd like him to know, that I have been a fan of his since he did guest spots on shows like Just the 10 of us and Beverly Hills 90210! I have to say Chandler is my favorite part he's had though! I don't care how skinny or chubby he is. He's a very talented guy and I love him just the same!
