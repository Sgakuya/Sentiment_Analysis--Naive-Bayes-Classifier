Joan Crawford was a great star, as opposed to being a great actress. Sometimes the latter is actually preferable. But you had to be blind not to see her charisma and prescense on the screen. It's a pity that too many fans only remember her late '40s films onward..she really did become a caricature of herself. Her early '30s MGM films showed her at her seductive best..(look at her in "Grand Hotel" ) though her later MGM films like "the Women" and "A woman's face" are as good as anything she ever did. I suppose the Warner films, especially Mildred Pierce is what she's best remembered for. As to her private life, good or bad, it seems that her career was what was most important to her. That is why the people who helped make her career, like the crews of her films, the cameramen, etc, loved her because she treated them very well. They all say she was a real trouper and very professional.
