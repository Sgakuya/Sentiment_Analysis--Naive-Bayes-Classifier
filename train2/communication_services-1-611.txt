For almost a year now I have suffered through lousy connection after lousy connection. My phone doesn't even work a mile up the street from my house which has unusually excellent reception (the place where I need it the least). I have just had my first experience with customer care, and was shocked that they don't have a service center in Ventura County. I'm having problems with my phone and I have to drive over an hour away to have some service tech verify that it is not working correctly before they will replace it. I'm not exactly sure why I pay extra for phone insurance, since I am still going to end up paying a pretty big deductible, on a cheap nokia phone. I would not recommend Pacific Bell to anyone, and am looking forward to switching my carrier as soon as my contract is up.
