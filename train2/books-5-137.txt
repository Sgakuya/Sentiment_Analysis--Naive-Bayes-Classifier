This book really captured something, though I can't quite put my finger on it. When you get done reading a book, or watching a movie, or even listening to a cd for that matter...and it makes you really think..thats how you know its great. When I read this book, I really got engulfed in the emotion. I found myself laughing, and crying at parts. You'll really like this book, if you can comprehend its deep meaning. So check it out, and Rock On! Also check out my rating for Girl, Interrupted the movie.
