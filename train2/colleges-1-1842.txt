One of the few schools in America where people actually graduate more stupid than they were when they entered. Just look at the grammar and spelling of the morons who rated this glorified elementary school a five! To top it off, the town this college is located in (College Station) is like Jonestown. Literally everywhere you look are the ATM signs and businesses pandering for Aggiebucks. If you want the same experience of going to Texas A M for a lot less money, just give yourself a lobotomy and join a cult...
