'96 Camry, 130K - Would be a good engine, if it had come with some kind of good rubber, seals. Leaks oil like sieve. Valve seals, multilple engine seals, hood rod seals. If its a seal, its failed. Have owned Nissan, Mazda, Subaru, never had this kind of problem. Sad to say, I'm done with Toyota. Forever. Back to Nissan.
