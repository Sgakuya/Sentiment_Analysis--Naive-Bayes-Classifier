There is a very short list of actors that are of such incredible talent that I will see any movie they are in, just because I know their performances will always be outstanding. Morgan Freeman is at the head of that list. His performances are never overdone, never excessive, and always touching. He always seems to strike the right tone for the character or the situation. The fact that this man does not have an Oscar is an absolute crime.
