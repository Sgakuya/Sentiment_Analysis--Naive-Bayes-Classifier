This book is better than the George C. Scott movie. It deals with his ancestry, his childhood, his dyslexia, his education, his battle experiences in Mexico and in the first World War and his disillusionment between the wars. It discusses Patton's relations with his family. It has fascinating vignettes of the officers and soldiers with whom Patton worked such as Montgomery, Eisenhower and Bradley. And it is a fascinating portrait of the U. S. Army before, during and between the two world wars. D'Este's biography is the definitive biography of General Patton and a classic. Well done!!!!
