there is no real acting on MB's part! He is always looking away when he is in a conversation with someone! If there were no cue cards he would be lost. He stumbles over his words which drags the show down! On SoapNet he even states When he goes on vacation or is off, he has a major storyline. It will be so REFRESHING when he does go on vacation so this way I can see some REAL ACTING!
