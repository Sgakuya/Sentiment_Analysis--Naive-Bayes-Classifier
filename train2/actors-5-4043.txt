Clint Eastwood is both a great actor and director. Which will he be known for better is somewhat up for debate. But his performances are legendary. Whatever the viewer's political inclination, Eastwood plays the most unforgettable roles- whether as the Man with No Name in the Sergio Leone westerns, or as Harry Callahan in the 'Dirty Harry' series. Perhaps more than anything, he epitomized his own legend in directing himself along with a great cast in 'Unforgiven'. Long after the dust settles, Eastwood will be rated among the best as he rightfully deserves to be.
