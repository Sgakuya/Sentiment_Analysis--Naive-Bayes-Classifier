Adam Sandler is the funniest guy i've ever seen. Even when i am in the deepest of depressions, he can get me to laugh. And truly, that is what he is there for. Not to impress you with acting ability, but to entertain you with his comedy.His style of humor may not be for every one, but in my book, he is wonderful. (And no one needs to feel sorry for me for that reason.)
