I went there. Waste of time and money. Degree is worth nothing especially in this economy. Tech is dead. Ot of the group of guys that I went with many that graduated never found work. Those that did got laid off and are unemployed or in some other industry that has nothing to do with anything they trained for at DeVry. Our class valedictorian, ended up bankrupt, homeless and is still unemployed.
