When they were Cellular One these guys were great. I was with them for 8 years without a problem. When they became Cingular, it only took them 3 months to aggravate me so bad I switched. Horrible coverage and worse customer service. They actually had the gall to tell me that their networks were too busy to provide each phone a stong signal and that individual subscribers call's were unimportant . I think not.
