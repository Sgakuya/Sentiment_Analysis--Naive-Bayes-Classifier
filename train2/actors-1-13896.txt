Her success is one of the great mysteries of life. In a world of better actresses, she continues to make $ with sub-par work. Attractive? I see better looking women every day of my life. I've seen actresses that were more engaging at community theater. Worst of all, her overrated performance in ERIN B. will inspire a generation of professional women that it pays to be a pushy broad when all else fails. Ever since the early 90's, I've asked myself what producer she slept with to get a job. She couldn't polish Jodie Foster's toenails.
