For two years I taught Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird to 9th graders. It remains my favorite book of all time, containing coming of age and racial prejudice. It also has humor, drama, and a wonderful, realistic set of characters. Although Peck's performance in the movie was flawless, I still believe this should be a miniseries to include more of the elements.
