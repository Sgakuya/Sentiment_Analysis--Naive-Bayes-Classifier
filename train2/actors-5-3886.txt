I too am in love with the talented mr damon... ever since seeing his latest movie The Bourne Identity (I scored preview tickets to a show in Reading - Yes!!!) Not only was he great in the film (due to his nice boy image, I reckon, portraying a bad guy who forgets he's a bad guy is perfect for the boy-next-door that he is) but Matt Damon proves even without his curtains he looks nice. He had his hair shorter and it looked gorgeous. Love him, love him, LOVE HIM!
