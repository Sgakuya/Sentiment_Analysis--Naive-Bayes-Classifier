I am not an American, but I would want to be only so I could help get Jeff Bridges elected president. He is The Man. One of the most eminently likeable actors I have ever seen, he is also versatile, unlike Hanks, Nicholson, or any other overrated Hollywood hack. We'll even forgive him for Tron, which was crap but certainly not because of him.
