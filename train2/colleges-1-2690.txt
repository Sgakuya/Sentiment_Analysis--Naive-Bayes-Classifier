A toilet. Isn't this the alma mater of JC Watts, self-hating negro who cozied up to the rightwingers and became the political equivalent of those little jockey statues you see on the lawns of racist yuksters in the lily white suburbs? Or was that OSU? Either way, both schools suck it big time, as U of Wyoming (another terlet) grad Dick Cheney would say. Half the state universities in this country should close down, because when you consider the poor quality of education afforded there, the taxpayers' money is being totally wasted.
