Cookie Crisp, one of children and adults favorite cereals, is so unhealthy. First of all, it's all sugar, and doesn't have any essential vitamins that are good for you. It's a carbohydrate which contributes to weight gain, but also loaded with sugar. Low sugar is so much better, and these are high in sugar.
