I completely agree with the reader below. But readers of modern autobiographies should come prepared: the style is quite dense by modern standards, and not an easy read. I had a terrible time reading this in school, but I was glad I did (not then, but much later (:). It really is one of the best autobios of all time. Adams was a historian, philosopher and diplomat who met just about every important person (political, arts, business, you name it) in his day. It's especially interesting if you want to learn about his times (turn of the century).
