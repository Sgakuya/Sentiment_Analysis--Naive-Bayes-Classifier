He was the No 1 man for me a few years back, Russ Crowe is doing it for me now. However, I consider Hoffman the greatest actor I have ever witnessed on the screen. Kramer Vs Kramer is up there in my Top 10 fav Films and his performance was outstanding. I could not imagine another actor in that particular role. Convincing and believable. An actor is only as good as the script allows, yet Hoffman can turn a bad script into something truly amazing. Wonderful performances in many many great Films. I bow to this man.
