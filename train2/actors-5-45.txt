As far as I am concerned, Jimmy Stewart is the greatest actor of all time...yes, I am more than a bit prejudiced. Actors of today would do well to emulate him. He was a hero on and off the screen. One thing I admire most about him is that he treated his fans with such IMMENSE respect. The same thing cannot be said of many of today's celebrities (there are very few STARS these days.) This was and IS a man worth admiring.
