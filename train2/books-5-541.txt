LOVED this in the second grade. I tried the Violet Beauregard thing with the gum for about two days before I gave up. The Great Glass Elevator was a little freaky for me. There was one poem in it about a girl that went, with stomach pumps and rubbers rings, they did a lot of awful things.. That scared me so much I still remember those lines. Was Dahl on acid when he wrote that?
