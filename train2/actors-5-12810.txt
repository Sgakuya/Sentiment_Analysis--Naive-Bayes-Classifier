I wasn't sure what to make of her when I saw the Matrix because I didn't think they gave her enough to say (on top of the fact that I felt all the characters were written rather flatly). But she did a convincing job of playing a tough girl in Red Planet and I just went into shock when I saw her in Chocolat with Juliet Binoche and long hair. The little tough girl was strutting around town as a cold, uptight and overbearing small town mother. I couldn't believe it was the same girl. I definitely think she's worthy of more work for us to see.
