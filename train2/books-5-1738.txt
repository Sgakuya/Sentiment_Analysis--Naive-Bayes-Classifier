This has basically everything I want in a strip: variety, consistent cleverness, fun art, developed characters, well-thought-out stories, adorability, daringness, the occasional poignancy to help us identify with the characters...you name it. An escapist fantasy (or sci-fi, in a real stretch) that resists being entirely escapist. I could hardly ask for better.
