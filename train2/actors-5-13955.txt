I am giving Julia Roberts a 5 rating because of her performance as Erin Brockovich. She seemed to capture what the film (and supposedly Erin herself) was all about. Before this movie I would have given her a 4 or even a 3 - I was not overly impressed with Pretty Women like many people were and the 3 would be for that. I did think she did a good job in Sleeping With The Enemy and would rate her a 4 for that one. But I must say that I would give her a 7 if I could for Erin Brockovich. This is one of the rare films I will watch many times, and Julia was superb! I was thrilled to see her win the Oscar. You deserve it, Julia-- from a new fan.
