wha can i say...MY FAVE!!! michelle pfeiffer is, in my opinion one of the best most diverse actresses among them nowadays. what i admire about her most is the fact that she challenges herself. she takes different roles on....not like the same type...like some ppl subject themselves to doing romantic comedies for example. she doesn't do that. let's look at this....she played catwoman in batman returns, which she expressed herself was one of the hardest roles she'd ever taken on what with all the training for the stunts and such. then she played in what lies beneath....she's petrified of the water and the big finale was done in the water. she's done period pieces (which are NOT easy to do...i know from experience on stage myself), the age of innocence and dangerous liasions. she's also done fun stuff like married to the mob and grease 2. dd i mention she has tackled shakespeare?! come on, you HAFTA give anyone who tackles shakespeare some MAJOR props!!!!! and she sings in her movies too. not very many ppl like to do that. i also have a lot of respect for her for the fact that she won't do (or @ least hasn't done yet) nudity scenes. it seems to be that nowadays movies are alwayz better or are simply based on whether a sex scene is explicit enough. i think that's all a buncha crap and it seems so does michelle. if you ppl don't think she's an awesome actress or @ least someone to DEFINATELY be credited, i'd really like to talk to you and see what the hell you're thinking! lol
