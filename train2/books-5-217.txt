This book is fascinating. I saw the movie first and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to read the book, too. Turns out the movie really distorts (or omits) many of the major events in the life of John Nash (a math genius who battled paranoid schizophrenia). So if you liked the movie and want to know the real story, definitely read this book. Nasar appears to have had access to most of the important people in Nash's life, and the epilogue claims that Nash himself - while initially disturbed by the idea of someone writing his biography - found some kind of solace by reviewing the events of his life.
