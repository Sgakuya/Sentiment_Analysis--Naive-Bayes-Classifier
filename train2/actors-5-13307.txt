In Will Grace , she's the woman you really don't want to be (because, despiting her weird sarcasm, she's still dumb) but she's also the woman that you envy. She always gets away with it (she doesn't help a thing in work), she dresses prety well, she's stilish and looks cool with her stupid way of talking. Only a great actress could suport such a complex role... and that's Megan Mullally.
