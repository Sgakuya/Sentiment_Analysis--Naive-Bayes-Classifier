96 windstar transmission self destucted at 61000 miles at a cost of $2300.00. No help from Ford. Same story, out of warranty and ind. diagnosis. Would suggest all other owners with same yr and problem to start send emails to center for auto saftey and nhtsa. Maybe someone will take our case in a class action law suit.
