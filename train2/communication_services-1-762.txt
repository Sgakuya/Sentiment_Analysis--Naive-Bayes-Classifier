 sprint pcs provides the most terrible service that i have ever seen in my life. costomer service representative attends you call after a long 30 minutes which speaks volumes about the complaints that they recieve. their system for monitoring actual minutes seem to be outdatred with a good part of your night time minutes counted against the day time usage. You will realise this if you follow your usage on an every day basis. Day time minutes were even added to my account while i was talking over the phone at 10.00 pm. Sprint pcs never accepts their mistakes. Their website itself is deceptively simple with little options provided in it. I want to rate this service as 0 . unfortunately there is no zero. so i am giving 1 for them. Good luck!! if you have sprint pcs service. nightmare might strike on any day. be watchful.
