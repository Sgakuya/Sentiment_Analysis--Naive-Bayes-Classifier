She is a horrible actress, completly a bore. And for the way she looks...let's just say I'd hate to see the way she looks in 10 years. She looks like someone pulled her out of a box in an alley, and slapped her in the back of the head. She looks diry, and has the worst taste in clothes I've ever seen. And that greasy looking hair, i'ts time to take those extensions out honey, and please, take a bath!
