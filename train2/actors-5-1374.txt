DeNiro is one of my favorite actors. Taxi Driver and Raging Bull established him as one of the most talented actors of his generation. And his obsession with getting into roles is legendary - gaining and losing extreme amounts of weight, completely changing his physical appearance, immersing himself psychologically in the world of his character... DeNiro takes it all very seriously. And, while he has been known to repeat roles (most notably the gangster character in Goodfellas, Casino, etc.), he has portrayed a wide range of characters, from the near-catatonic patient in Awakenings to the no-nonsense priest in Sleepers. I was especially impressed with DeNiro's role in Midnight Run, because before that movie I hadn't realized he could do comedy. Then he was genuinely funny again in Wag the Dog and Analyze This, both good movies. Few other actors compare.
