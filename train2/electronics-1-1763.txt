The after sales service is TERRIBLE. I had a problem and wrote to Panasonic. They told me that it is defective and to bring it to a repair shop. I decided to call repair shops to make sure it had to be repaired, because with past VCRs repairs sometimes made things worse. Final result, I spent 2 hours on the phone investigating. Turned out the VCR was fine, someone said I had a function (auto shut off) turned on instead of off. He solved it in 2 minutes and said Panasonic should have known it. It was in the manual (I thought it didn't apply to what was happening in my case). Panasonic doesn't care about the time I spent due to their error. Their lack of caring extends all the way to the president's office, including the president whom I spoke to. They don't return calls and don't care at all about their errors.
