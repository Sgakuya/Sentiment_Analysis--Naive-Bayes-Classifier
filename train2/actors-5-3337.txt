Of course, like Wiggum, I would give Harrison Ford five stars for his two most famous roles alone (Han Solo in the Star Wars trilogy and Indiana Jones). However, it is clear that Harrison Ford is not limited to adventurous roles alone. Of course Harrison Ford was excellent as CIA Agent Jack Ryan in all the Tom Clancy films (Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger). He was also good in Air Force One. Exciting thrillers like Presumed Innocent and The Devil's Own round out his impressive resume. It was also interesting to see Ford try his hand at romantic comedy roles (Sabrina, Six Days, Seven Nights). Although he is much better in action/thriller roles, Ford's awesome screen presence alone can keep the audience's attention, no matter what type of film it is. I believe that Ford's best post-Indiana Jones/Han Solo performance was a Dr. Norman Spencer in the 2000 supernatural thriller What Lies Beneath. It was quite interesting seeing Ford undertake a darker role, and I must say he pulled off the ending with sheer brilliance. In the final analysis, I would have to say that Harrison Ford is probably in my top 5 list of favorite actors. I am just amazed at his awesome screen presence, natural acting ability and obvious charisma. His career is still running strong, but even if he never made another movie again, he would still be considered, and rightfully so, as one of the greatest actors of our time.
