The worst customer service in the history of mankind...Average time trying to get a problem solved--30 min. Bills that don't add up between the summary and the detail...customer service reps that don't know why...managers that don't call you back...being sent to collection agencies before you even get a bill...phones that go into roaming in the middle of your local area...etc., etc., etc.
