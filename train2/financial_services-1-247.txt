A deposite pending on the 7th gave me an AVAILABLE BALANCE of $101.03. I made purchases. On Sunday, the 9th, the deposite VANISHED: it was neither pending or posted...it was just GONE! It's the 10th, the deposite is pending again on 01/10. Now they charged me 30 for every purchase I made. BUT I HAD AN AVAILABLE BALANCE!! IT SAID SO CLEARLY ON THE ONLINE STATEMENT, WITH THE PENDING DEPOSITE. THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING BUT CAUSE ME MENTAL ANGUISH. I WOULD LIKE TO SUE THEIR @$$! But they have powerful lawyers. What do we have? Pralines and d!ck.
