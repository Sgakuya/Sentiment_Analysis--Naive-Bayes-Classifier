This novel by Arthur Golden fooled me at first. I thought it was an non fiction novel, only to discover when I finished it that it was fiction. Nevertheless, it was a fantastic story of how a disadvantaged Japanese girl grew up to become a very famous and prosperous Geisha. It gives wonderful insight on life in Japan during the pre WWII era.
