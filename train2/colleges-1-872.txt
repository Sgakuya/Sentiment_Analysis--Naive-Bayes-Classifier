I would not recommend this school to anyone. After they got me enrolled I had difficulty getting responses from staff. Prior to my enrollment, they were super quick at responding. The teacher was useless. Classes are 5 weeks long, and she had not given out grades or feedback until the 4th week started, even though she was supposed to do it weekly. She ignored questions in the classroom newsgroup, and when pushed about getting feedback she got nasty and started posting about how we should respect those in authority. Give me a break. For the price, I expected top quality. What I got was total unprofessionalism. The learning teams are a pain too, so beware of those. Then they only allowed me credit for about half of my prior work, which tacks on a year and several thousand dollars. Forget it.
