The problem is the randomic way to high speed record and to finalize the DVD. I had to change three DMR-E100H before I could have an operatin machine. The same problem twice since I have two of them. I am very disappointed with Panasonic becouse those problems are on top of a manual written to make you feel stupid and incompetent, without it I did it better.
