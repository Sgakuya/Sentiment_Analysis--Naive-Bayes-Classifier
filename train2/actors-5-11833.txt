Angelina is without a doubt in my mind, an amazing person. I admire how very real and open she is. It is intriguing how some can be themselves so truly, and still have to bear viciousness of humanity. She gives her all when she is acting, and even when she isn't. People who choose to badmouth her based on information that is not factual, are indeed among the ugly-hearted. and to those who criticize her looks and acting...two things 1) i'm sure you're not that hot, and 2)i'm sure you haven't won an Oscar either.
