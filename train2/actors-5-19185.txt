Oh my God! You guys, i know that this is going to sound so juvinial but i am so head over heels for a man i don't even know! Yes, thats right, that man is Matthew Perry. I have been watching Friends for I beleive it to be 6-7 yrs. It was about two or three yrs ago that I relized that i was actually in LOVE with him. It wasnt his looks that attracted me to him(even though he IS so handsom. No, it wasn't that. It was his smile, his eyes, his over-all personality. I know in my heart that he is a man that can treat a woman right. I know that i will never met him, but that wont ever stop me from praying for it. When he began to gain weight I heard people talking about it in ways that made me ashamed to be the same species as them. I would think to myself why do people base life in the physical appearances. He is still the man he has always been. And a great one at that. Then when I found out that he still had a drug problem I just wanted to be there for him to help him through it. Matt, if you ever read this, i just want you to know that i'll be behind you all the way. M.F.
