There are not many actors who can play so many different roles as he and be so convincing. From the rebellious teen dancer in Footloose , light comedy in She's Having a Baby to the sadistic guard in Sleepers and the tortured inmate of Alcatraz. If you haven't seen him in Murder In The First , you don't know how impressive acting can be. This man is awesome.
