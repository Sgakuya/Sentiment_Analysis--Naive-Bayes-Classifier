She is BY FAR my favorite actress and her character, Karen Walker, on Will Grace would not work if it was played by someone else. Watching her is the best part of my day. She FULLY deserved that Emmy and I wish her just as much luck with her singing career. THANK YOU MEGAN FOR BRINGING A 1/2 HOUR OF JOY TO MY DAY!
