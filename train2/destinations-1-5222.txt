I've lived in Northern (Berkeley), central (Santa Barbara) and Southern (Los Angeles) California, and have traveled most every area in btwn...and I must say that the state is WAY over-rated. Perhaps in the 60's it was a decent place to live - not so now. In my experience (just moved after living there for over 7 yrs) it is an extremely crowded, expensive and often superficial place living off it's past glories...well those days are over folks! One serious problem that can't be overlooked (unless you're wealthy enough to insulate yourself from that reality)is illegal immigration. Crime, gangs, drugs, horrible drivers are just a few of the symptons of this spiraling epidemic that only seems to worsen by the week. (BTW, don't even try to race-bait me; I am married to a Brazilian so I obviously don't have a problem with immigrants per se; it's ILLEGAL ones which are the problem, as they clearly have no regards for U.S. law). In sum, if you're just visiting the state, it may be pleasant enough in small, entertaining doses, but anything more than this will likely quickly jade you to the place - count on it.
