I forgot to rate this nasty swill when I was rating the Anheuser Busch beers last week. Once again, another fancy budweiser named something else. This beer is honestly one of the worst ever. It is very bitter, and definately does not go down smooth. I just totally hated it. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Bleah.!
