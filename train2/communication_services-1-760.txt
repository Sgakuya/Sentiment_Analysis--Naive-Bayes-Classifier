Customer service is horrible, and the website is useless. I have been trying to access my account online for over three months. The links don't work half of the time. It takes 2-3 days to receive the password via phone text message, and the password still doesn't work. I have been hung up on and disconnected several times. The bill shows no detail of how I am being charged - no history of phone calls. It is the worst I have ever seen.
