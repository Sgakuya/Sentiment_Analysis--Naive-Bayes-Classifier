Calvin and Hobbes (along with The Peanuts and The Far Side) is one of the best comic strips of all time. Unlike most other cartoons, C H seems to be weathering the test of time with ease. I've read the the first compilation book about 10 times, but if I picked it up right now it could still make me laugh. Bill Watterson's creativity is responsible for two of the most real, compelling, entertaining comic characters ever brought to black-and-white life, which is an even more impressive feat when you consider the fact that Hobbes is a stuffed animal. C H is an enduring tribute to the power of imagination and the unique perspective of childhood. It was great getting a new one each day, and I really miss it.
