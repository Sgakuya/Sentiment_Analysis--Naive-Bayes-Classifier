As an actress, better than average, I suppose. As for the Vietnam stuff- disgraceful. I'm left-leaning in most ways, and would have been opposed to this war, which was utter nonsense brought to the American public by the rich, conservative whack jobs, John Birch types, bluebloods that live in fantasy land, ignorant and proud of it hardhats, good old boys, bow tie wearing heartland ministers,etc. A war where mostly non-whites, kids with no other options, working class kids etc, went. A lot of them didn't come back, or came back messed up on drugs, or had difficulty adjusting to life in some form or fashion. I'd have been opposed to this flimsiest of wars, but in no way, shape, or form, do I find this silly person admirable. It's one thing to be opposed to this war, but quite another for some ivory tower entertainer to pull the cruel sh** that she did.
