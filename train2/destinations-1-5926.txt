Some stunning scenary,especially near Denali National Park, and some towns in the Klondike region are charming. Anchorage and Fairbanks are not at all interesting urban centers. The rest of the state is storm and windblown in the Aleutians, and frozen in the region north of the Yukon. IMHO too republican, cold and out of touch. Pioneers? Hardly the state recieves more federal money then any 'blue state'.
