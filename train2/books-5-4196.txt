THIS BOOK RULES! this was the best book i've ever read. it's amazing how a book that was written in the 50's can fit so well to our time. when i read it i really thought it was written in the 90's or something like that. Salinger wrote about the teen age mind so perfectly, like he was a teen ager himself. it was like reading a teen agers diary. he thought like a teen ager when he wrote that and did'nt left out any thing. he rememberd all of those amotions a teen ager has- the feeling like you're alone, the hate you have for everything and everybody, the depression, the self hate. it was amazing in every way you can describe it. anyone who did'nt like it is probably stuipd or spoiled or just forgot what it feels like to be a teen ager.
