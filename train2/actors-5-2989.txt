Such a wonderful actor. My husband and I are HUGE Bond fans, and I miss him so terribly when I see the new Bond movies. I still love to watch them, but they're just not the same. Connery could walk into a room and just his look alone could convince every woman that she had to have him:-) His voice could melt butter. (He seems like a very versitile actor, as well.)
