I must say i am only 15 yrs. old but just because i'm young doesn't mean i can't see great talent when put in fornt of my face. Russell Crowe isn't a great actor, but a outstanding one. As seen in his roles before you can put the worst part upon him and receive nothing short of greatness. I belive in order to become one of the great ators/actress' you have to have fun with your part and be ready to give it your all. Russell Crowe has proven to do this feat. As for 30 Odd Foot Of Grunts, the music is great and the lyrics are good. I have found out that quite a few people believe him to be very arogant. I don't really think he is, but don't get me wrong everyone has attitude. I hope he continues his awesome career and I'm trying to learn some things for my own career in acting. Viva la Russell Crowe.
