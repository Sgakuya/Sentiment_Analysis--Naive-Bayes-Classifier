I love Jason Biggs. He is such a great actor and I love the fact that he only gets better with every movie. American Pie revealed the comical side of him, but Loser revealed a more caring and loving, romantic. Jason you are hot and talented and I cannot wait and see what you come up with next. Keep up the good work.
