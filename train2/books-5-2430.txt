God I love this strip! It's so smart and funny. It's interesting to see things from a baby's point of view (or at least what the animators thinks it's like). It's a fresh strip that doesn't really repeat itself, or at least not in a dull way. Baby's are just so cute and innocent, or at least, that's what they want you to believe...
