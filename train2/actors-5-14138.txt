She is one of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen lately!!! She shines on the screen, whether in Pearl Harbour, The Underworld, or her latest movie: Van Helsing, alongside Hugh Jackman. They make a fantastic pair in the movie. Kate was brilliant with her harsh, European accent, she pulled quite a performance in this movie. I can't wait to see her in many more movies in the future, she's got real talent!!!
