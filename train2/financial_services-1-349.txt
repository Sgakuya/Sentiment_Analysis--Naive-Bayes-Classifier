Bank One is absolutely the worst credit card out there. Whatever you do, DO NOT TRANSFER A BALANCE AND LEAVE IT with them! I had a First USA card which was bought by Bank One. I moved and switched careers and racked up a balance of about 6000 dollars and carried it for a few months. I paid more than my monthly balance, but without warning or explanation, my APR went to 27.99%!!!!!! I never missed a payment and have an excellent credit rating. Luckily, I had credit with others, so I transferred the balance and tore up the card. Can they even do this leagally?
