Really a horror story, and a horrific look at the life of a retarded man. It is a great novel and an interesting read. Charlie Gordon is a mentally retarded man who undergoes an operation that makes him into an intellictual superman. The story revolves around him and his feelings as he adjusts to his new intelligence. Are his friends really his friends? Can his family finally accept him? It is a shocking expose of how the world takes advantage of the less fortunate among us. The ending is unexpected, and will make you think about just how fragile life is. I highly recomend this novel.
