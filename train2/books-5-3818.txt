An all around fun book. Author Joseph Heller uses language and logic to make a hilarious and bitter satire about war, america, and everything else. This book can make you laugh when you read about Major M. Major, or pull back in disgust when men's bodies are blown to pieces in B-series bombers. If you don't yet know what a paradox is, this book will show you one inside and out.
