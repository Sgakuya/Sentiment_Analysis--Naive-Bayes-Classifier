That was an aweful thing for this man to say. I burst into tears upon hearing it; wondering how it would make the soldiers feel. Those people who would die to protect him and his right to insult them. Maybe some of the protesters support the troops, but this guy certainly does not. Everything the troops are doing right now, all their efforts and lives risked and lost, he basically just told them it's all a big joke. These young people who have volunteered their careers and even their lives to serve their country and commander in cheif - he's saying that everything they do; their lives and their choices, are all a joke. Yes, this is America and he can say whatever he wants. But I will exercise MY freedom to say that in my opinion, making such statements at a time like this is distasteful and flat-out dishonorable.
