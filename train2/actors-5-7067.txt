Wow! I'm really surprised to see there are no comments about Paul Walker! I was exepecting things like OMG I love him! and He's all mine! I hate the way people treat starts like they are objects instead of people, trying to claim them and stuff. I mean, wouldn't you be freaked out if strangers started saying they loved you? I would. But anyways... Paul is cute (*blush* *blush*)and he's such a great actor. I think it would be awesome to meet him. Other people who have met him say hes so down-to-earth. But it's never going to happen...
