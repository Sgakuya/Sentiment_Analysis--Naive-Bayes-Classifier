Comments like Illinois has been the academically most powerful university in the Big Ten are what makes other schools hate you. You are currently rated behind Northwestern, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the Big Ten in US News and World Report. You are an AVERAGE Big Ten School. Don't kid yourself. Illinois fans are the most fair weather sports fans in the Conference, and the one road game no student at any other Big Ten school wants to go to.
