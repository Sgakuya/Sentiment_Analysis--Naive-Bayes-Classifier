John Wayne was - by far - one of the greatest actors. Especially in westerns. I know that he did many westerns but my all time John Wayne movie was not a western. It was called The Quiet Man and he starred with Maureen O'Hara. She was in alot of his movies, and together, they were remarkable. I still love to watch his movies. The best classics--indeed!!!!!!
