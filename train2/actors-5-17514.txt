Leslie Charleson is my favorite actress of all time! She is definitely too talented for daytime telelvision. The shame is that ABC's General Hospital is privileged to have her and they don't even use her. How foolish! I for one would like to see her go back to prime time episodic. Perhaps her talent and beauty would be appreciated there!
