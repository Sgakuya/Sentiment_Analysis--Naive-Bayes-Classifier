Jada is a terrific actress and person. I see a lot of haters out there that thinks she is fake... She is one of those people who are strong, but yet soft.. She knows how to act her her color when needed.. She can go kick it with the most thugged out people and then go to the white house and chill with the president.. As can Will... They are true to themselves and that's what matter... She is beautiful, talented, she has a family, husband, and a career.. HATERS are not going to stop her... Check out her CD & her tour with her HUSBAND!!! Get it together people...Give people their props!!!!!
