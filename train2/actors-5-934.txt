Al Pacino is a magnetic actor who is brilliant at what he does, and I would like to see him up on the big screen more often. I think it would be very interesting if he and Mary Tyler Moore were in a movie together as a couple. Not many actors can portray drug addicts and cops equally well. I also liked the film Author!, Author! in which he was very likeable and believable as a New York playwright and devoted father figure of 5 or 6 kids.
