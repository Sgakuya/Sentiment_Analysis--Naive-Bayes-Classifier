What GH did to this man (twice) was an utter travesty. To treat such a fine actor as he, with such contempt and lack of professionalism. It was like someone behind the scenes was carrying out some personal vedetta against him. Mr Nichols is very talented man who brings a certain something to each of his roles. Any soap would be lucky to have him. GH was foolish enough to drive him away...twice!!!
