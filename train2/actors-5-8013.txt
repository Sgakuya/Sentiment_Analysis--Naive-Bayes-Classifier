I give Audrey Hepburn 5 stars because not only is she beautiful, sweet, and charming, but she is a fabulous actress. My favorite movies of hers are Breakfast at Tiffanys and My Fair Lady among many others. She is truely one of the greatest because she never overacted or appeared phony. She really acted from her heart. Her compassion was there all the time. As a person she seemed to be generous and sweet and one of the most caring people. As for her style, what can I say? She created the Audrey Hepburn style that people try to mimick to this day. May her gracious soul rest in peace forever.
