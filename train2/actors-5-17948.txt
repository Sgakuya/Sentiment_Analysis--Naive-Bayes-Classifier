Kelly Monaco is one of the best and most intriguing actresses currently on daytime. All of you who said that she is a terrible actress don't know anything about the craft of acting, and I hope you guys do stop watching gh because it doesn't need viewers like you. I'm pretty sure that the award winning casting director and the producers of the show know more than you do about what good acting is and about how to make a good show. Keep up the great work on GH Kelly!
