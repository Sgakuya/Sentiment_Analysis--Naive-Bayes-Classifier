If we gather all the OSCARS awarded for the films in the history of cinematography it would be the partial price for only one MEL GIBSONS moviemaking BRAVEHEART!!! Here are no enough stars to rate him, and I do give him what we have here plus all what we have in the sky. THANKS GOD THAT WE HAVE THAT GREAT MAN IN HOLLYWOOD!!!
