Alan Rickman is one of the best actors I've ever seen. He has bad films but NO BAD-MADE ROLE. A lot of people here (and not only here) have expressed their opinion about this man and I can support almost every of them. The only thing I wanna add is that he is a very expressive actor who never overplays (as many of his colleges do). He is a real scene stealer and I can't take my eyes of him even if he plays a small part.
