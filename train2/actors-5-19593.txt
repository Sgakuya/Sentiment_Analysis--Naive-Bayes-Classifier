5 for looks, 4 for acting in Lois and Clark, 3 for acting in other roles. As far as I am concerned, it just doesn't get any better than this in the looks department! Hubba hubba! I liked him in L C, he was a good actor, very touching sometimes, LOVED his Clark Kent side!! Too bad he doesn't get as much work anymore.
