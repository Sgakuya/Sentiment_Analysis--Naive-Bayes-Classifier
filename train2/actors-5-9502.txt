Ellen Burstyn a terrible actress??? Who gave her that rating without commenting on one of the finest charcater actresses of our time? Did they see her winning role in Alice ? How about her light romantic comedies like Same Time,Next Year ? If that's not your cup of tea,then try high drama with A Dream of Passion . With every role,Burstyn cuts to the heart.Truly amazing! If she were in England she would be a Dame. Here in Amercian she is typically treated like an over the hill actress. Thank God for Requiem For A Dream the Yards . Perhaps Ms. Burstyn will once grace the big screen where she ruled in the 70's.
