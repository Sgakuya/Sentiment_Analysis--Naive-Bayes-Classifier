These things just don't meet the hype. I like the concept and the texture but everyone had been talking them up for so long, it was almost an instant disapointment. The mint flavor is artifical and the size is prohibative. Why carry around a 6 inch tube about as awkward as a flashlight when you can fit 30 smint or tic tac's in somthing smaller then a pager. I really hate the commercials too, time for some updating.
