I think that Jackie is the Valerie Harper of daytime. She can turn the screen on with a smile. She can stand out even when she only has a single line and there are 4 actors with more lines in the scene. There is something very live, smart, and vivacious about her. Now, all that she needs is a storyline. The audience would just love that.
