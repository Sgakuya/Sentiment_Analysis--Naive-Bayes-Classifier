Take it from somebody who went here: if you're not a science major, don't bother enrolling at UCSD. Also, the stupid f_cking Regents will bleed you dry for the rest of your God foresaken life. Another thing--this dump is full of pimply-faced nerds, fat chicks, and computer dorks. I think I saw exactly 3 semi-hot chicks there in 4 years. Skip it!
