Nicolas Cage is one of the most talented actors. From his early Movies such as Red Rock West and Zandelee to his newer ones like Family man and Gone in 60 seconds, He always makes my movie experience outstanding. He earned his Oscar the hard way with out riding on his Uncles shirt tail. His Eyes show so much meaning that my heart jumps everytime I watch one of his films. People only watch his newer movies but a true fan goes back and watches the beginning ones to watch him truly evolve as an actor. He has been in some movies that were not the best script but the acting on his part has always been first rate.
