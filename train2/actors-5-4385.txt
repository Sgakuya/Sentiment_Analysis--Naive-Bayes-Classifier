If you need any further proof of what a great actor he is, just try to recognize him from one film to the next. He transforms so completely into each character that no one recognizes him! Try William Tavington in Patriot, to Chaz in Sweet November, then Lucious Malfoy in Harry Potter, and so many more. Pure genius, and a real charmer in real life too!
