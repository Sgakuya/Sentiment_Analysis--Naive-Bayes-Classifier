This is a joke...I'd much rather have a 1997 Acura NSX...hey, they're the same price! The only reason this is on the road is for rich daddies to buy thier bratty children because everyone else thier age has a honda. This is the worst concievable atroucity on our roadways today, other than the corvette, of course.
