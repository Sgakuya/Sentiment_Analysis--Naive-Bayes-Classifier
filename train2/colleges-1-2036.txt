Austin is a TERRIFIC place to live; and fortunately, UT hasn't managed to ruin it. UT is a predatory university; throws every conceivable obstacle in front of students; ENORMOUS class sizes; has an authoritarian administration and treats its staff like serfs; and UT has the very mistaken belief that UT is the only game in town. It has several really good programs, and Austin is a great place to live -- but I couldn't recommend UT to incoming students.
