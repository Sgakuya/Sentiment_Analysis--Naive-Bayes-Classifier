This actress is being wasted by the writers at AMC! I've seen Olga Sosnovska on two episodes of Law and Order, and she steals every scene she is in. I wish AMC would give her more screen time, and for heaven sakes, let her and Bianca have a REAL romance. This separation is so contrived and a waste of a fabulous actress.
