I am still currently reading this book..but I found the beginning very boring and quite disturbing when the girl is raped...and i also find some other parts gross too...but the whole concept of the book is heart felt..i mean..who couldn't feel for an innocent child lost to a cold-hearted killer?...it made you look through a point of view at a family who has to overcome their grief and try to find evidence to link the man they suspect who killed the girl...this book should win an award
