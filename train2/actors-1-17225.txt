There is no subtext to her character. She just spouts the lines given to her. She can't show positive or deep emotions. She can do anger and sarcasm only. Those are safe emotions. She's evidently afraid to put herself on the line to feel love, fear, loneliness, sadness, yearning etc. She has too many distracting mannerisms and says you know what at the beginning of almost every sentence.
