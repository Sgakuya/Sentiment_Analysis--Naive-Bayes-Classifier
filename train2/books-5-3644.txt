1984 is a very interesting book that offers a view as to how a hypothetical totalitarian society would be like in the year 1984. Orwell wrote the book at the beginning of the Cold War, when the communist threat was very strong; this made Orwell's writing come to life even more. The two main characters are definitely unique. They fall in love despite the fact that love is not permitted in this ideal (?), but sterilized society. Everything is monitored by Big Brother , an entity/leader who controls all everybody's activities by placing monitors in people's homes and on the streets. It's interesting how it became that way through a big war which happened 30 years earlier. If anything, the society described in this book is reminiscent of Kim Jong's North Korea, where all of a citizens movements, emotions, etc. are tracked daily. The book really makes you think because there are many underlying themes at work throughout the book. That is what makes Orwell's writings so interesting. This is also evident in Animal Farm , Orwell's other literary piece about a communist revolution in a farm with the animals playing different roles within the revolution.
