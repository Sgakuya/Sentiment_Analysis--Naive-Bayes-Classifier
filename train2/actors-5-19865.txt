The queen of comedic irony or unpredictability, her surprising characters have me in stitches. Especially as she gives the appearance of a dear, sweet, old lady on TV, it's hilarious when her characters turn out to be tough talking or bigoted ol' bi***es. Will always love her as Rose (dumb, naive, but always kind) on Golden Girls.
