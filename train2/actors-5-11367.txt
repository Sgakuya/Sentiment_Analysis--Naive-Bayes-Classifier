This woman is not only a great actress, she gives me a silent pleasure everytime I watch one of her movies. She is absolutely beautiful. I especially like when she has her hair tucked in behind those cute little ears of hers. Her husband is a very lucky man. I wish her all the sucess in the world. :))
