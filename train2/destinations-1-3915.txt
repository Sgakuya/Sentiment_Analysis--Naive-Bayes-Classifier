Worst city in the eastern US, bar none. They can call it America's Most Livable City all they want-- all I know is, every single person under the age of death is moving out so fast they leave skid marks. What's left is a Rust Belt dump with the stupidest, most provincial citizens I've ever had the mispleasure of knowing. No active culture, no arts scene, PATHETICALLY BAD nightlife-- a sh!thole!!
