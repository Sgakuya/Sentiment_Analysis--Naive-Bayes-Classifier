Although I would not use oscar wins or nominations as the sole method of rating an actress in this case it is indicative of her true ability. 13 Oscar nominations and 2 wins. Her consistency alone is worth noting. Her body of work is not equalled by many on this list and certainly not exceeded. I am very glad to see her close to the top 10 here but in reeality she is top 5 material. Very very few on this list are as capable an actress as Streep. One of the best of the entire 20th century.
