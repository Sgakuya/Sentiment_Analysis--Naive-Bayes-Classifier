If you drive suv's, especially a Hummer, you support terrorism. Oil comes from countries that are enemies to the U.S.,by purchasing a gas guzzling vehicle you keep the U.S. dependant on foreign countries resources. You may think it is the all American vehicle but the fact is is that Saudis are responsible for 9/11 and they couldn't have done it without money provided by you. I also agree with the mid-life crisis small penis theories. Look at me, look at me I'm a sheep in wolves clothing.
