Sarah Michelle Gellar is absolutely amazing. I'm one of her biggest fans in the world and always will be. She is a versatile and very talented actress and gives very strong performances. While I loved watching her on Buffy I am looking forward to seeing more of her on the big screen. I am very excited about The Grudge as I am sure she will be superb in it. Not only is she a deciated and talented actress she is a wonderful and lovely person and a great role model.
