High crime, high taxes, a mediocre state university, filthy (you see garbage everywhere), and rude, ill-mannered, unfriendly people. Annapolis is overrated as is the entire Chesapeake Bay-what is so special about swampy, mosquito infested shorelines and brown, brackish water anyway ? Baltimore is a dump, Ocean City is tacky, southern part is filled with redneck hicks. High humidity and temperatures in the summer. For a state that supposedly ranks in the top 5 for income and educational attainment I swear there are more blue-collar, low-class, thoroughly unrefined people than I've encountered anywhere else. If all that isn't enough, there's the awful accent--goin up er on Sayer-dee for a Bawlmer Oreos game--so if you can't tell already I don't care much for the place.
