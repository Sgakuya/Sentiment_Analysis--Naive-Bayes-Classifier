Not only is this Amazon a beautiful woman with amazing talent, but she is also a classically trained opera singer. I am a big fan of Xena (I admit it) and truly believe her to be a great role model for our daughters (She sure is a much better one than Britney Spears or Ginger Spice). I can't wait to see what Lucy does once Xena is taken off the air (The series finale is this season). I'm a big fan of the show but let's hope that her next role ISN'T Xena on the big screen!
