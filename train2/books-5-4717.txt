A breath of fresh air in modern English literature. The road, as so many have said before, is a metaphor for life, and Kerouac accepts it unconditionally, all the pain, the joy, and the confusion. It's an honest, self-conscious, awkward, occasionally painful drive to the core of the Beats. Kerouac may have typed, but he typed his truth.
