Chris Browne has portrayed the personality of the Scottish Terrier to a 'tee'! The cat - who is aloof, but definately in love with his Scottie, Duncan, is hilarious. Duncan is THE success story for Scottie Rescue, (Duncan's first Christmas is a Must-See!) and represents the breed traits wonderfully! Truly what it's like to be 'owned' (and loved) by a Scottie. Adele and Big Daddy are real people, with real bodies, real affection for their fur-kids, and best of all, for each other. They are a refreshing start to my day. Keep em coming, Chris!
