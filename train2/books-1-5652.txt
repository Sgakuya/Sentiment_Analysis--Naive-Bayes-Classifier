This is a very offensive book. It is completely based on Rushdie's ignorance on the topic of Islam. It was so offensive that the Ayatollah Khomeini put a $2 million bounty on his head (dead or alive). Rushdie purposely attacks the Muslim community by discrediting (gross understatement) the holy Quran and the prophet Muhammed.
