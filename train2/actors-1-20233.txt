Quite possiblt the worst of all actresses. First of all she has the monotone voice the whole friggin time and has only 1 emotion. Like when Tom Hanks meet her in Cast Away after coming home she wasn't happy to see him at all. She said ''Oh, do you want some coffee?'' in her voice of hers. Quite dull.
