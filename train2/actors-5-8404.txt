Marilyn was a great actress. She was so gorgeous that people overlooked her grat talent. She was great in serious roles and in comedies. Very few people know that she was extremely intelligent. She also was one of the most beautiful and sexy women ever. I just wish that she had the sense to stay away from JFK and Robert Kennedy instead of having affairs with them. Nonetheless, she is an all-time great actress.
