Every great soap has a King and a Queen, Erica is deffinetly AMC's QUEEN! She is the Grand Dam of her craft, a woman who acn be loving and kind and hateful and vindictive! What a shame her peers are so jealious of her as to not give her the credit due her. I am so glad that she was finally honored with, and has long deserved an emmey and it was so great to see her finally get that overdue acknowledgement! What a joy!
