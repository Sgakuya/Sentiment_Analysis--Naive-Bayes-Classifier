I think that Susan is a wonderful actress and has brought much more attention to daytime than any other actor. Sure Susan could have tried to move on from AMC and gone for the movies or television. However I think she went the smart way because if you think about it, how many 5'0 actresses with brown hair get hired. Her name is and always will be associated with daytime television and if she succeeded in making her name a household name, then I think she's done a pretty good job!!!
