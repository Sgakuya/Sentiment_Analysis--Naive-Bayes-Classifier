I've lost count of how many times I have read this book. Mark Twain was a profane man in real life, but a gifted writer, and Huckleberry Finn was his best product. The various dialects are a delight from beginning to end. My favorite part was the evening Pap's father got drunk in the cabin and start ranting and kicking things around. I don't think anything in any other book has made me laugh that hard.
