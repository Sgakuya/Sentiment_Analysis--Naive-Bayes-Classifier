I just bought and tried my first pack of NEW FLAVOR Lifesavers. I, for one, will not buy another pack unless they bring the original flavors back. The purple ones taste like fruit flavored soap, and the watermelon tastes like all watermelon candy tastes- fake. I cannot believe a company would suddenly change a product that is known and loved to so many people. The new flavors are definitely NOT an improvement and over the old!
