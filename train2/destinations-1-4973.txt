i drove up here from my state (trashachutsetts) and it was cold, boring, and nothing to do. wow, a pine tree...you gotta show me more than that. if you arent a winter person like myself, there is absolutely nothin to do here. the people here are stuffy at best. who cares about the gay sports teams?? is that all there is to do is sit around and watch sports all day or look at a pine tree?? give me a break.. maine = no palm trees, no white sand, bad marijuana with tons of seeds, women are uptight (just like trashachutsetts), and its cold
