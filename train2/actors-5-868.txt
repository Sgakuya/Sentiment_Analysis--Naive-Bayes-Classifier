One, if not the most versatile actors in history. Nominated for an Oscar numerous times but only won once. Should have won for The Godfather & Dog Day Afternoon. Best films: The Godfather, Heat, Sea of Love, Dog Day Afternoon, Glengarry Glen Ross. Worst films: Cruising, Revolution, ...And Justice For All (embarrassingly miscast in all three). Little known films: Panic in Needle Park (his first film), Scarecrow, Bobby Deerfield, Two Bits (all great movies).
