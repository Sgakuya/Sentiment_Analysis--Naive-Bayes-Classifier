The greatest tough-guy actor ever...of course. White Heat, Roaring Twenties, Angels with Dirty faces were all great. He had the best punch of any actor I've seen. My favorite is when he squished a grapefruit into Mae Clark's face. They say that he totally ad-libbed that. But Cagney's versatility is displayed in such movies as Yankee Doodle Dandy (he was an extraordinary dancer and excellent singer) and Mister Roberts. I have found memories of my brother and I watching Cagney flicks the afternoon cinema TV shows (that was in the pre-Oprah/Springer days). Outstanding!
