This book is a waste of time. Ann Coulter claims that liberals say terrible things about republicans. Yet she says bad things about liberals. One of her quotes is The only good democrat is a dead democrat. This comment is horrendous. Every little thing she said is hypocritical and false. She claims there are no bad republicans. WRONG! Ever hear of Fred Phelps and David Duke? She obviously has not. In Ann's twisted mind, Racism, Killing, Bigotry, and Homophobia are okay, but Democrats are bad. I hope she lays off the crack.
