'My name is Michael Caine' He has the most wonderful acting and has starred in many fantastic films such as 'Alfie', 'The Italian Job', 'Cider House Rules', 'Zulu' and many others. He is such a pleasure to watch as he really brings the characters to life. People usually think 'Alfie' is quite a sexist film. I totally disagree with that, just listen to the narration and you will see what I mean. He is so popular over here in the UK and is seen as one of the greats - and he most certainly is.
