Windstar 1995 - Great room for kids/cargo, safe feeling and nice handling, BUT what will go next?!. Had major break overhaul, headgasket last month at 2000Kms over special warranty - only offered 50% of repair by Ford cutomer assistance .Ha! on a first name basis with customer frustration center . Cruise just went, wind-shield fluid sensor always stays on, door mouldings coming loose, etc,etc...See 'ya in small claims Melissa, Michael, David, John....!
