Cingular has absolutely terrible service in Florida. In three weeks I didn't have one phone conversation that either didn't drop words or drop the call in progress. Calling their call center was an exercise in frustration, they put you on hold and hold and hold. When I tried to cancel my service contract because their horrible service they billed me for the entire year and when I refused to pay, since I no longer used the service, they turned loose the collection agency on me. They are a bunch of Nazis! Do business with Cingular at your financial peril!
