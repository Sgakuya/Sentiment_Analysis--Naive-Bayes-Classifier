Thomas Kerry, I'd like nothing better than to whack you upside the head with the Bible I presume you carry around everywhere. Since when was Requiem For A Dream glorifying prostitution? I sure as hell didn't notice a happy ending for Marion or any other character. And you say her director is a jerk that has made a big tit bimbo out of her . I imagine you're singling out the director of Requiem For A Dream, as you can't seem to get off the topic of dissing it. Believe me, you are not even worthy of smelling Darren Aronofsky's sh*t. Requiem For A Dream was not only a powerful film that holds a revered place in my DVD collection, but one of the best career moves for Jen, as it obviously led to her being cast in A Beautiful Mind, the film on which she met her fiance Paul Bettany, not to mention winning an Academy Award. Jennifer is beautiful both inside and out and deserves all successes that befall her. Have some taste, why don't you, and don't blame Jennifer because nearly every film to hit the theatres has sex and violence in it. Stick to VeggieTales flicks if it bothers you so much. -Jez
