One star too many. I think that the only way Rogers is staying alive in the cellular business is by tricking potential clients that their cell plans are just dandy. And then your stuck in contract. Customer service is bad and I find they offer a lot of broken promises. I got conned and many of my friends got conned... After ON THE DAY that my term is up i'm cancelling and moving onto another provider. I absolutely hate Rogers. Heres a website. www.ihaterogers.ca
