What an excellent actor. He deserves more roles, but apparently has been stereotyped after being on Star Trek for so long. It doesn't help that he's bald as a cue ball either; I'm not trying to be mean about it but Hollywood only views him as that well-spoken bald guy from Star Trek . I find him to be a wonderful character actor and have yet to see a poor performance from Stewart. Make it so.
