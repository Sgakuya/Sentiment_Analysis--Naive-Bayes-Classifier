Hugh Grant is my favourite actor and not only because he's soooo hansom but he's a good actor too,he's the bomb!!Hugh Grant rules!I am a fan of him and I admit I didn't see all his films but about a while I have seen them all haha :-) Bridget Jones's dairy is one of my favourites and I also liked Mickey Blue eyes. He's a good actor and I don't think you have to look at him like a cheater because of his affair with Devine Brown.Hugh's a human also,just like all of us,and fold are there too make.But,I would do anything for this man!He's sooo hot!Nobody understands it because he's more than 20 years older than I am and not hansom (the other people think) How can anyone say this man is not hansom??He's a goodlooking man for his 40 years.I really really love his accent.I wish I could meet him one day. Elizabeth Hurley is/was a lucky woman!!! I am from Holland,the dutch language is my language I grow up with so I'am sorry for the folds in the englisch language! Lots of love and xx Chantal and a big hug to Hugh and all his fans!
