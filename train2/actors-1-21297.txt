I do not hate Hilary Duff.....however, I am without question, sick to death of her.She is so overrated, it is sickening. Why do they let any blonde, rich, poptart sing? The girl is of extremely mediocre talent. And, I know that the blonde hair kind of blinds people into thinking she's pretty and hot, but if you really took a look at her....she's just average. She looks like every blonde wannabe out there. With or without her clothes.
