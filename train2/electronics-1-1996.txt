I hate the GameCube. I hate it. If I were a Nazi... I'd say F JEWS! LET'S TAKE OUT THE GAMECUBE!! Only I would say it in German. Nintendo needs to learn who is the boss in the new generation gaming industry. Yeah SNES was great... but N64 came out and proved how much experience Nintendo needs in order to compete with todays Gaming Giants i.e. Sony and Microsoft. BURN IN HELL GAMECUBE!!
