Top this!! We bought a BRAND NEW 2004 Kia Sedona on November 3, 2004!! It had 47 miles on it when we drove it off the lot. Seven days later, the transmission went out on it!! Incredible huh?? Well, just today, November 27, 2004, it broke down AGAIN!! The tow truck just came about 2 hours ago to tow it away for the 2nd time in 24 days!! I am so mad I could spit nails!! We also have a 1997 Escort (110,000 miles) and a '99 Silverado that we have NEVER had problems with!! I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone!!
