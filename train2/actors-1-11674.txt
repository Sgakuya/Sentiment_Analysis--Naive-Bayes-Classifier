This is one horrible actress. She makes me feel like vomiting when she acts. If you really want to see her idiotic side just watch her in an interview and you will find out just how silly and idiotic she can be. She is great at squinting and pouting. And like someone else said she is clingy and whiny.Just Awful!!!!! Her roles are basically the same and her acting stinks. If it were possible to give her a zero or negative rating then I would do it. How can anyone like this woman????
