We were booking a famlily vacation there for June this year, and no one at the DISNEY RESORT, PARK, or on ANY of the calander of events at thier web pages told us it was GAYDAYS with over 2 weeks of events covering our stay! We have cancelled our trip and are going to DOLLYWOOD. They were very ugly about not needing to tell us, and I am fighting them on the refund. Totally wrong to book a family with 6 kids under 10 at that time without mentioning it. I had even said we were not lo0cked into any dates, and those were the ones they selected for us.
