Russell Crowe has inspired me so much. When he acts, you feel like you are really there. He is totally irresistable and you know he tries his hardest. He is natural and makes you feel safe and comfortable. I first saw him in The Quick and the Dead , but when I saw Gladiator that instantly became my favorite movie. No one on the face of this earth could have been better for that role. I now constsntly talk about how great he is and how his acting skills have just made me want to try harder in that career. His movies are the movies that I never get tired of watching!!!
