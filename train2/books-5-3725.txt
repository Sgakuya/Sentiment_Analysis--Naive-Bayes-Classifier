Lee's novel has an excellent plot line, wondeful morals, and is in a class all its own. As for Scout knowing more than a 6 year-old should know, this book is a flash back from when she is like 10 or 11, and Lee is braking the stereotype that all Southerners are stupid, and proving to you Yankees that our vocabulary doesn't just consist of aint and other less charming four letter words. Lee is know safely at the top with the likes of Poe, Tolkien, Bradbury, and Twain.
