I came to usbank with an identity theft problem and they told me that I had to do the work myself in order to prove my case. I did my part. Did I get my money back? Yes, but usbank put it in the wrong account and did not take any of the overdraft fees off that would not have occurred if the money was not taken out in the first place. They are so bad that I can only rank them as a 1, but that is even undeserving. If the ranking system had negative numbers they still be less than a negative 5.
