I detest Hugh Grant. I think he's a terrible actor, and I don't like what I've heard about his personal life. I have no idea why many women are crazy about him. He's not very attractive, and his acting seems canned and sleazy to me. The only explanation I can come up with is that he's non-threatening (in a girly sort of way- yuck!). I avoid films in which he's the star, although I did put up with him in order to see Bridget Jones's Diary. I have a feeling he'll be hard to avoid for a long time.
