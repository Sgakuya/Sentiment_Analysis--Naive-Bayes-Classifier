I read this book as part of my English GCSE and therefore had to get down with the nitty gritty details of it. I agree that if you read it more than once you reach the inner meaning. The book isn't just about little boys who regress. It shows the structure of society concerning politics and beliefs. For example, you have Piggy, who was the voice of reason, he stood in favour of what was the right thing to do and was killed, Ralph was the strong leader who collapsed under the pressure of doing what was right, Jack represents the wrong in this world along with his sidekick. The little 'uns and the choirboys are like the general public and follow whatever is the most powerful at the time. Simon (whom in my opinion is the most important character) was wise beyond his years, he knew what was happening and tried warning others, they laughed at him and eventually they thought he was 'the beast' and got killed. The beast is the fear that resides in us all, in reality 'the beast' was a dead adult from the plane. This is a very clever book, and I'm surprised that someone a year older than me (I'm 19) couldn't see all of this.
