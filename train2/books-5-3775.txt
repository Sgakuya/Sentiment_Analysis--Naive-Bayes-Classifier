This is yet another of Shakespeare's greats. I know it is supposed to be a comedy, but really. I felt very sorry for Shylock. His If you prick us, do we not bleed speech is one of the best speeches of Shakespeare's ever. So he went a bit far with the pound of flesh. He was hurt. Him and his people had been discriminated against for so long. He's not the monster he was made out to be. Such a touching story. The characters were quite likable. Antonio was good, very loyal, risked his life for Bassanio. That is very honourable. all in all, good play, good plots, good story.
