I went on a long trip round the US a while back and have to say LA was the worst place visited. A sprawling mess of a city that lacks the landmarks of NYC and Chicago. The people generally come across as being phoney and seriously up themselves, especially all the wannabe movie actors waiting tables. Ar*ehole of the USA.
