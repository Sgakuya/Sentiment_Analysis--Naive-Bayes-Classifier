Dr. Pepper is the sickest, worst pop ever. Everything about it is sick; the flavor, the name, the bottles, the color, and the ads. It tastes too horrible too describe. It tastes like an overly sweet, overly carbonated cola with a strong fake cherry taste, and left open for a week. This is the only pop I wouldn't drink if I was paid. Obviously, anyone who enjoys it is sick.
