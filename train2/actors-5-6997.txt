I have only seen him in American Beauty and his performance is something I idolize. He can do as many horrible movies as he wants,he can suck from here on out and I will still consider him one of my favorite actors just for playing Ricky Fitz perfectly. What a promising young man. I hope to see him in the future. I know his next film is Soul Survivors. Lets just hope it isn't an embarassment. Still, he is one of the best. Very talented.
