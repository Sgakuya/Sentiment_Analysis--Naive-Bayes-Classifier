While bragging to my guests how good the turkey breast with stuffing was, as I served it to my six guests, the first person to take a bite showed everyone on his fork with his turkey was a huge clump of hair with assorted green crap clinging to the hair. You will never know how much business you will never have after this endorsement!!! I am so embarrassed, everyone threw their entree in the garbage and said they would never accept a dinner invite at my house again. They have all left and your phone line is closed and I am in tears. I saved the green hair clump and will send it to whoever wants to check it out. Please respond to this mail ASAP. I have the boxes it came in, there are three. I'm not sure which box the green clump of hair was in, so I will keep all three boxes for you to check. I'm so upset. I thought I could impress them with your product and everyone was grossed out and left. My e-mail is Betsonjack@webtv.net and I hope to have a response by 2/25/5. I will call the 800 number in the morning and hope someone will answer. I am devestated and so upset. Maribeth Gleeson, 2201 Vineyard Rd, Novato, Ca 94947
