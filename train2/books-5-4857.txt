written around 1830.perhaps not known so much by the anglo-american community. but besides shakespeares dramas one of the most important books that ever was written. about the human nature itself, struggeling with the good and the bad, that are all just different sides of the same personality. about the sense of life in general. about the temptation of mankind through evil. and the struggel finding the right way. especially the second part is full of visions that became true: the growing importance of money and economy and any aspects that are basics for the modern life. like shakespeares books about timeless conflicts and so never loosing importance.
