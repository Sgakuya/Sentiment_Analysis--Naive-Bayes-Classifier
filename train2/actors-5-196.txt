One of the most complex and confused actors of all time- but also one of the most gifted. Brilliant in 'The Search' and interesting playing an 'introverted cowboy' in 'Red River'. Shallow and somewhat lackluster in 'The Heiress'. Brilliant in 'A Place in the Sun' and again 'In From Here To Eternity'. Loved him in the 1960 film directed by Elia Kazan 'Wild River' Burned out, but again great in 'The Misfits' and 'Judgement at Nuremburg'. Haunting, melancholy, he brought a passive intensity to the screen for a man- that had never been seen before. That was the fascination- and in the end what destroyed him, along with his hidden homosexuality.
