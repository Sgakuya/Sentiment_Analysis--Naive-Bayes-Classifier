Ho-hum. Closet case TV actor who bombed on the big screen, and for good reason. Second rate talent, typecast also for good reason. I saw a rerun of Magnum P.I. recently and was appalled at how crappy that show was: juvenile, mindless and cartoonish. Since his career has been in the terlet for about a decade now, he's morphed into Darling of the Droolers, giving the rightwingers a Hollywood shill they desparately need, yet decline to admit it. One star for his talent and work product: I don't care about his wrongheaded, retarded and outmoded politics, so they have no bearing on my rating.
