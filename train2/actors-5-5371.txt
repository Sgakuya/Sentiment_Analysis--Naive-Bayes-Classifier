I think he's a wonderful actor and he has a nice smile! DOA is one of my fav's, also Something to Talk About. I would love to catch The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia! It came on this week and I meant to tape it and forgot because I had a test that night!I've been looking in the vidoe stores for it for years and couldn't find it too!
