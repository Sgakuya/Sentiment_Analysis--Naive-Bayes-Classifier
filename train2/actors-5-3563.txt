A personal favourite of mine. A real man's man type of actor, without resorting to cheap tough guy heroics. He is one of the few actors who can convincingly play either good guys or villains. I understand it is very difficult to play a good guy who isn't a tough, macho, gun-toting cowboy, and still be interesting, but Harris injects humanity and imperfection into his good guy roles. Even his bad guys aren't totally evil (except maybe for Major Koenig in Enemy at the Gates) but have understandable reasons for their misanthropy.
