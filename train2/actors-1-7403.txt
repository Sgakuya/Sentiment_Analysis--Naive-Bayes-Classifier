This guy needs to get in touch with reality. Then again - so does everyone in the entertainment industry. Every time this guy opens his pie hole about the real president I feel like putting my foot in it. He doesn't have a freaking clue how to be president in reality. Note that he only PLAYS the part of a president. There is a reason Bush IS president and not you. One of the biggest problems with Hollywood and the media is they live in imaginary worlds they create and speak out as though it is reality. Until Sheen's world actually portrays and represents reality he needs to keep his damn mouth shut! In my book there is only one actor who ever qualified to be president - Reagan.
