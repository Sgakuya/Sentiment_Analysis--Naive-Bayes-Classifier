Love that book! It lets you into exactly what was going through Lance Armstrong's mind. I would be scared to do that. But Lance lets you in on every little detail of his testicular cancer, every little detail of his relationships with various people, every little detail of everything! He's right. It's not about the bike, it's about the book. And I doubt, I might be wrong, that many of you will have recognized Sally Jenkin, an excellent writer who helped Lance Armstrong put this incredible story into writing. Everyone, read this book.
