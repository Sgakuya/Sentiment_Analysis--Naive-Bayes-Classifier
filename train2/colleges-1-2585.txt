U. C. Irvine is a Mickey-Mouse school (no offense to Mickey Mouse intended). For example, the cashier's office closes at 3:30 p.m. This makes life difficult for evening students with evening parking permits that do not allow them to park until 4 p.m.! The registrar stays open until 5 p.m.; however, the registrar will not process many requests until they see that you have made the necessary payment to the cashier (which closes early at 3:30!). Often, a student stands in the registrar line, only to be told to stand in the cashier line. Many universities have combined the cashier and the registrar services into one office, so that students do not have to stand two lines. Why doesn't UCI do this? UCI is part of the enormous University of California bureaucracy. This vast bureaucracy takes away freedom from the individual universities. Customer service in some situations is non-existent. Making any kind of academic change requires a lot of paperwork accompanied by a lot of signatures from people who are in their offices only a few hours per week. Any such change takes the University several weeks to process, and the university does not tell you if progress on your request has been made. Engineering classes tend to be theoretical, not practical, and unneccessarily difficult. Students at UCI tend to be quiet (which can be a nice thing), but they put up with a lot. Copying of homework is not uncommon among students. Adding and dropping classes is a paper mess, requiring students to fill out their changes on cards, which require signatures. Students cannot add or drop classes in the weeks before classes begin. Instead, this havoc must be accomplished during the first week of instruction. All of this could be computerized, like at non-UC schools.
