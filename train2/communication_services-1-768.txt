SprintPCS Customer Service is the worst ever. When I first subscribed with them, it took me a month and several phone calls to get my phone. Of course, they billed me for service while I was waiting that month for my phone, and I had to argue with them to get my money back for that month. Then I got a second phone accidentally, which they billed me for. It took them 6 more weeks and several more phone calls to get me a postage-paid box to return the phone. Good thing I wrote down that tracking number, because it took more time and several ADDITIONAL phone calls to get them to credit my account for the second phone, which was delivered and signed for by them, but which they claimed they never received. By the time the whole ordeal was over, I cancelled my account with them. No big surprise that they wouldn't refund my money for the phone I bought to use with the Sprint Service.
