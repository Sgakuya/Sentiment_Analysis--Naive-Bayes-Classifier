Ah, the chocolate brown, mile-long legged Angelina Jolie.. she is AMAZING! Come on all of you! That is true beauty, it's undeniable and utterly real. She's a bit quirky, but quirky is good!! Angelina stands out in her movies, you sit up and take notice of her presence. As for her husband, Billy-Bob is sexy! It's all a matter of preference! Oh, and all of you who think she's in a relationship other then sibling love with her brother, your sick. I kiss my brother too, I say I love him, it's purely a genuine love I have for him as his sister. You only see that as bad because this world is so degraded and people have become cynical and sick. Angie is the greatest!
