UoP sucks!!!!! They get your money and then screw you out of a real education. I made straight A's at UoP but the instructors I had for all my classes gave no feed back, no weekly grades(so you had no idea if you was actually learning the material correctly or not) and financial couslor was a joke! She would not return phone calls or emails. This college lacks too much to risk your hard earned money...find another college and seriously research them before joining!! To stanford: I made straight A's at UoP .. UoP's biggest problem is they are too big, hire instructors with full plates already to instruct, and lack financial aide that helps with book costs. Their program for financial aide is screwed up!!! AND I bet since you work at a hospital...you get employer repayment or at least half your tutition paid. A lot of people who haven't had the problems MOST of us have had....they were not fitting the entire bill therefore had no worries. But US who pay and work hard to get an education do find we expect MORE from a college whether online or not. I took on UoP knowing full well the work load would be heavy, but it was going to be well worth it for accomplishing my goals. So please do not say I or others did not have the abilities to complete our education. To UpsetStudent: I do agree with you .. UoP only sees potential students as $$$$$ and their programs stink!! Force you to take classes that do not need to be taken for you field.
