This comic makes me wish i didn't ever pick up the sunday paper. It's always the last thing you read, and it sucks- it messes up your entire comic reading experience. It's right up there with Doonesbury. I try to skip over it, but its always there, WAITING TO SUCK (Like they say in Go). I have to read it anyways, hoping one day it will NOT SUCK, but it always dissapoints me... always. Isn't there a point in time where things just have TO END?! I think this is one of them, for real. Rest In Pieces family circus...... please.
