Atlanta has attitude- is it justified- probably not- a growing metropolis, but rather traffic ridden, congested and hardly worth the hassles and heat. The rest of the state, is southern conservative- with a slant that goes back to the pre and civil war period- too much trash on the highways, too many ignorant people, and just an unpleasant place to live.
