Love Famke! Didn't think much of her beyond eh, another Bond chick in the beginning but as the movie roles went on the more I was drawn to her. Like Lara Flynn Boyle, she has really cornered the femme fatale part but it is so nice when she plays the good girl just as well. Deliciously wicked in 'House on Haunted Hill' surprisingly dead-on as Jean Grey in the X-movies and PHENOMENAL in one of my all time faves 'Love Sex'. It is so great to see her hit her stride at near 40.
