I just had the head gasket blow on our 1996 Ford Windstar. Hopefully the engine wasn't ruined but I will not know until I spend $2000 to get it running again. I didn't realize the gasket was an issue until I started surfing the internet. The stories are all the same..... Premature failure. I liked the van but mechanically it is a piece of junk. I still owe over $5000 more than I can get for a trade in..... ouch. Since mine is a 96, Ford will do nothing. Even though it's the same engine as the 95 (although they try to tell you it is not). This was my 7th Ford and my last.
