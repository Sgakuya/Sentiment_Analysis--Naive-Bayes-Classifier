Doris Day! Even her name has music! From the first moment she appeared on the screen, America and the world were hooked. She was different, and a breath of fresh air on the screen. Audiences took her to their hearts after they heard her sing and realized that she was truly an ORIGINAL. Doris has natural beauty...she shines and people who watch or listen to her know, that she's a realist. Her performances, both on film and on recordings are classic. My glass is raised to the top female boxoffice star in the history of the movies.
