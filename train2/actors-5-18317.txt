The supreme entertainer and artist,beloved by critics and public alike.If i have a warmer affection for Mizoguchi and Renoir(neither on this list,as yet!),there's no denying his #1 position is valid.Much more than a master of suspense and manipulator of audience emotions,Hitchcock developed an ever richer visual style,allied to greater psychological depth and control of the cinematic medium - often astounding camerawork,colour,editing,pacing,location..-for his own inimitably witty,thrilling,voyeuristic,rule-bending purposes.North by North West(a majestic adventure),Vertigo(wonderfully,ravishingly enigmatic),Rear Window,The 39 Steps(his British gem),Psycho,The Birds,Notorious, Marnie(grossly underrated),The Lady Vanishes,Rebecca,Shadow of a Doubt,Strangers on a Train;all acknowledged masterpieces from a true original!
