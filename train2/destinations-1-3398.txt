D.C. really is a weak place to live. Everything is geared towards tourists, which gives the place ZERO original character. It is good to come and see the monuments, etc. once in a lifetime, but that stuff, which is constantly listed as the best the city has to offer, gets old in a hurry for residents. I can't wait to get out of here and back to America.
