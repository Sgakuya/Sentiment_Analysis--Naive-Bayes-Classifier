Have you see her in the HBO movie, Wit ? She is in every scene and is stunning. It is an honest risky performance. Her closing scene with Eileen Atkins is wrenching and beautiful. I do have a request though. Does anyone know how to get a list of the music used in the movie? The credits roll by so fast it's impossible to get them. The music is so powerful and sad and beautiful.
