For all of you who think Chicago is nothing compared to NY, you're wrong. First of all your city smells like s**t and your buildings are too short, your people act tough and you talk too much, go to Chicago and see for yourself, and dont you dare put it down, you dont wanna get your ass shot, believe me, no one messes with Caponeland.
