What a has-been! She's recently had major cosmetic surgery (not the first time), and now she's filed a slander suit against some doctor for allegedly saying she has had a facelift. Maybe she's suing because he said she ONLY had a facelift, when in fact, she also had an eye job, resurfacing and new teeth caps!
