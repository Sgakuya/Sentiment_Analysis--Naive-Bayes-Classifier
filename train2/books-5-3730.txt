The point was that she did not understand that much as a six-year-old girl. The narrator is looking back on the experience as an adult and piecing together everything she now knows. The book was excellent. It showed real values and gave a glimpse into a culture most of the United States did not understand and still do not understand. I would recommend it to anyone, except those who prefer scandulous literature. They may not exactly get it.
