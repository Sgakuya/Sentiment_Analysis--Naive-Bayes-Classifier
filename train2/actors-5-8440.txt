When I was a young teenager in the early 1960s I had an elderly cousin who had owned a seamtress business in Hollywood from about 1920 until 1947. Late in her career she personally made gowns designed by Edith Head. She came out of retirement to handmake the dress that Olivia de Havilland wore in the movie The Heiress. Olivia won the Academy Award for best actress while Edith Head won the award for costume design. My cousin, Miss Retta, always held Olivia de Havilland in the highest regard. In her opinion she was not only one of the greatest actresses of all times but offstage one of the nicest and classiest people who ever lived.
