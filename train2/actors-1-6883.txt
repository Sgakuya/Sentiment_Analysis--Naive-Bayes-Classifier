He's in the pantheon of Truly Lame Actors, with a niche just down the portico from The Bruce Willis Wing, The John Travolta Enclave, The Sylvester Stallone Room, The George Clooney Urinal. Who actually spends money to go see his juvenile, cartoonish and ultimately boring flicks? Steroid-poisoned muscleheads who didn't get past the third grade? Teenage girls who dig a guy who has an accent like Col. Klink? All-around imbeciles who like action films because they're easier to understand than comic books? Rightwingers who hope to delude this idiot to thinking that he has a future in politics? Bicep-loving homos who would love to spot him in the weight room, or better yet, in the showers afterward? Maybe this guy should have spent less time at the benchpress and more time in acting class, but then again, if he had done that, he would probably get so much more work that movie theatres would have to supply patrons with air sickness bags whenever one of Schwartzenegger's bits of idiocy were playing. In this, more Arnold product could cut into profits, especially if the films were a three or four-bagger.
