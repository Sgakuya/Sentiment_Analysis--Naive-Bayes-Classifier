I can't bear to watch the commercial where Nathan is in the dressing room. It is tasteless and crude and has absolutely no bearing on wireless communications. I think you money would be better spent on a better product and better, less rude, employees from what I read in the comments. I know that we would never consider using Bell South Mobility even though we are Bell South phone users. This commercial tops them all.
