This phones is a nice to phone to begin with but after a few months the buttons refuse to work and the phone becomes useless...I have returned one phone back to the store(Circuit City) and the secound phone did the same thing after 9 months and now I am stuck with a useless phone (model #EXA18985) and cant get my money back or another phone.
