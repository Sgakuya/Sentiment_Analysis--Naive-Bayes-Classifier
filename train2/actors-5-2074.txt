So far he is currently the best British actor at the moment. Man is he good. In The Silence Of The Lambs , he took acting to a new level with his wide-eyed, soft talking Hannibal Lecter, and before that, and after that. In Nixon , he was outstanding! I wholeheartedly give him 5 stars for being the best damn British actor around. Summary: THE BEST BRITISH ACTOR AROUND.
