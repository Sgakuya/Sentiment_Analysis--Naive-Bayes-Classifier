This vehicle majorly BITES you in the wallet, with repairs both big and small in the first three years, some covered by warranty but many not. And VW's consumer advocates are do-nothing sympathizers that tell you Gee, that's too bad but have no power (or desire?) to really go to bat for you. We now drive Hondas- one a sedan, the other an SUV- and are much happier. VW, you stink BIGTIME!!
