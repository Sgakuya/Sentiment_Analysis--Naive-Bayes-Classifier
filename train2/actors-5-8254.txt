If there was ever a woman who made the eyes of a child light up and a smile form everytime they saw her it was Lucille Ball. I can remember staying up late many nights to catch I Love Lucy reruns and to have my parents tell me to go to bed. I would always wait until Lucy was finished before closing my eyes. At four and five years old Lucy was the role model of my life. I knew that nobody was funnier than her and I knew that nobody was ever going to be funnier than her. When all my other friends were watching cartoons I was watching Lucy and laughing the whole time. She created this clean, fun source of entertainment for me that I will forever remember. She is a huge part of my childhood. I have always admired her and I always will. She is the Queen of television. There will never be another Lucille Ball and it deeply saddens me that she is no longer on this earth to grace people with her talents. She has left a loving and warm legacy that will always be remembered for years to come. Lucy will live on forever. May she rest in peace.
