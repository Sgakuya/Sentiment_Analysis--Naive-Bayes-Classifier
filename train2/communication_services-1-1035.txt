If you want good service, DO NOT CHOOSE CELL ONE. My stories of terrible service as well as terrible assistance would fill up pages that many of you would be too busy to read, so I'll be brief. My phone (an analogue nokia which I paid quite a bit for) has NOT worked MUCH more often than it's worked, and when they fixed the phone, it still didn't work, and the service was just as bad (not just the phone). The phone was unreliable and randomly disconnected on me dozens of times. The customer service representatives told me that I'm stuck with the plan even if the service does not work , that's a quote from a Cell-One sales rep. She said she COULD upgrade me though, to a better plan because analogue phones always have more problems . They are not interested in providing adequate service as much as they are in making money. I still have numerous problems and rarely turn my phone on; I'm awaiting my contract expiration date. I've heard only good things about Sprint, although I have not tried them yet.
