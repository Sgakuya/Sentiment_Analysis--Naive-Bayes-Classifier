Among King's very best. This gargantuan novel clocks in at over 1100 pages in PB and I still wanted more. The story involves the end of the world after 99% of the population has been killed by a mysterious virus. The survivors pick up the pieces in an epic adventure. The Stand is not so much a hack and slash tale as it is a very human story with believeable characters. Don't be intimidated by the length of this novel. It will captivate you all the way through.
