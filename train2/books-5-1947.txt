One of the best and most brilliant of comic strips. Inspired the incredibly awesome "Garfield & Friends" CBS Storybook morning television show that ran from 1987 to 1995, 12 television specials, and much more. The strips are witty, well-drawn, have their own unique style and always consistently enjoyable. My favorites include the Christmas ones, which remind me of myself (for example one December 26th--"Only 364 days until Christmas!" ^_^), and any of the ones that break the fourth wall or satirize pop culture.
