Voltaire's savage and hilarious critique of pretty much everything including religion, patriotism, the belief aryans are somehow aloof, the goodness of human nature and most of all the popular philosophical belief at the time that this is the best of all possible worlds. Voltaire showed that the world isn't always like the picture our leaders paint in this book and manages to be exceptionally funny in the process.
