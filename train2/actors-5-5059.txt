I met Will Smith yesterday. I didn't know it at the time but they closed down a few blocks from traffic and pedestrians due to filming. I had to get through because one of my garages is on the same block as the filming, and I pass by this guy during a scene cut. I said hey what's up Will, and he was real friendly just like the Fresh Prince. The movie's called "Pursuit of Happyness" and he plays a homeless father in San Francisco who becomes a stock broker. He'll be in town next week as well, filming next to Glide Church.
