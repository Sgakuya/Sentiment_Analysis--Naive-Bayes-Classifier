Based on bios, what I have read and movies I have seen, Errol Flynn was a conceited egomaniac with only moderate acting abilities. Add to that lecherous drunk and you have, in the words of Roseanne Roseanna Danna a reeeeally attractive guy . UPDATE: Your point is well taken ThatGirl1269 and I hereby correct my original post; according to IMDb.com, Mr. Flynn was born Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn on June 20th, 1909, in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia which obviously made him Australian and NOT British as I had originally stated. Though he was born in Australia, the bio on IMDb goes on to say that the family also moved to England before he was a teenager. This could account for my confusion with his accent which more than likely was a combination of both countries. Either way, the In Like Flynn thing came about due to his scandalous little fling with an underage girl a statutory rape charge which, to be fair, had all the earmarks of a setup to get money out of him. This does not really change my original opinion of him since there were plenty of other escapades in his life and career in which he distinguished himself as a world class jerk with pathetic undertones.
