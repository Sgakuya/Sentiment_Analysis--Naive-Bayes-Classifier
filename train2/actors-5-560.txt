Sadly, much of Lon Chaney s work has been lost to the ages along with interest by the general public in silent films. My first introduction to him was through the old film staring James Cagney entitled, Man of a Thousand Faces . This is a good film, but don t expect to get the entire story here just a glossy but entertaining substitute. What I did glean from it was that Chaney was apparently one of the true geniuses and trailblazers of special effects makeup and costume. Film historians, film buffs and students may be the only ones who can truly appreciate the magnitude of his contributions to film. But I have a feeling that even though we may not always know it we are probably still appreciating the results of what he did to this very day.
