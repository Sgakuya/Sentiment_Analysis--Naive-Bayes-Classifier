Angelina Jolie is one of the best actresses I have seen in a long time. True, I haven't been around that long, but her youth and vitality are stunning. She uses all her traits to become the person in a role she takes on, which makes her a great actress. I have seen Girl, Interrupted, Bone Collector, Gone in 60 Seconds, Hackers, and Gia...and she was AWESOME in all of them. So for all the critics who say, Her acting could have been better , or I didn't like her in that , find another job. You obviously can't see the awesome talent she possesses.
