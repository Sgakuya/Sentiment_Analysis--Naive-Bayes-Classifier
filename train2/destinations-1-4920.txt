This city was horrible. We couldn't land because of poor visability because there was too much smog, an ominous start. The stench of polution as horrible. Poverty was everywhere. Crime was high. Soldiers walked down the streets with assault rifles. The only saving grace was our Hostel in the burbs was superb and town square with the palace and churches was good looking.
