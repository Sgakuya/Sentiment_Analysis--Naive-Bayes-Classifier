Amazing! I never would have thought she could inspire so many adverse reactions? I have to admit, her whiny whimpy character in Jerry McGuire made me want to vomit (she should have just kicked Jerry to the curb, he was so far up his own butt), but have you not seen her in Cold Mountain, Down with Love and Bridgette Jone's Diary? I really rate Renee: she, unlike alot of the other ice princesses that grace our screens and can no longer frown, let alone squint due to all the botox, is not afraid to look unglamourous, silly or vulnerable in the roles she plays, and I find that quite endearing. Anyway, I'll leave you all to your own opinions, but Renee rocks, and she'll continue to get better with age I am sure.
