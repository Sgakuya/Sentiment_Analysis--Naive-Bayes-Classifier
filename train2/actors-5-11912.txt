The thing I find myself drawn to in a person is that spark that makes them just that much more daring and wild from everyone else. Spontaneous. Life is taken so seriously, as it should sometimes be, but everyone needs to play to stay sane.. or insane for that matter. that's why I admire Angelina JOlie so much.. She sums up all that energy and shows it through the characters she plays.. The one character I didn't like was the Bone Collector chick... It was dull and it had nothing to do with her acting.. it just was very expected. My favorite character was Lisa from Girl Interrupted. That is just an amazing character.
