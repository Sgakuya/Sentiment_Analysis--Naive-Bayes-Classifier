Charlize Theron is one of a very few actresses in Hollywood who are truely beautiful. She is absolutely radiant. She has she same appeal to the public as Marilyn Monroe. Her beauty is more that that of the physical nature, but her soal is truely the heart of her beauty. As an actress she is totally amazing. Her performance in The Cider House Rules was so moving and absolutely touching. At the end of the movie, I felt a world of mixed emotions, from saddness to happyness, to hope. Yes, some credit certainly has to go to the directors and the crew, but she seemed to make the movie all come together, into a reality. She puts her whole mind and body into her character. It is amazing how she is so convincing. Even in her smaller roles, you can see that she truely studies the character she portrays, down to the mannerisms, such as the biting of the nails. She truely is one of Hollywoods best actresses.
