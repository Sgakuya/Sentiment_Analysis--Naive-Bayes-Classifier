I have always liked Cary Grant. He was a versatile actor.I loved him in Penny Seranade I still get choked up at the scene where he is begging the judge to let them keep their adoptive baby girl.He could be funny too. He was just as good in Father Goose as the the man who must share his small island with a a teacher and seven school girls.He was a very classy actor. I loved to hear him talk him talk, He accent was unique.
