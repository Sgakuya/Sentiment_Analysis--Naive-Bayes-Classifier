I'm not too familiar with Jones' acting, but he gets an automatic five stars for his voice. Jones' commanding, deep voice is probably the most well-known voices in Hollywood history. From Star Wars as the voice of Darth Vader to The Lion King as Mufasa, Jones will forever be remembered for his amazing voice.
