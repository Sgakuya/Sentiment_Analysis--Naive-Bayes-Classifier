How can you forget True Romance? She was amazing as Alabama, with her cute voice. 'That was the most romantic thing...' is the best line. She says that to Christain Slater after he kills her parents. That is my all time favorite movie. She was also Ben Stillers girlfriend in 'Flirting with Disatster' and if you've seen it...the scene where her armpit is being licked is hilarious.
