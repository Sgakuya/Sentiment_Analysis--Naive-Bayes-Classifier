Hi, I think Reese Witherspoon is a very talented actress. She is absolutely fantastic in ever single role she plays. I particularly enjoyed her performance in 'Fear'. It is a great movie. A good depiction of teenage relationships. I hope to see more of Reese in the future. Long live Reese Witherspoon! She is the absolute best! John.
