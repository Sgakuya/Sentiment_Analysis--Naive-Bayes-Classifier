I had cell one for a couple years. At first they seemed alright but then I started getting roaming charges from in the city I live. They took them off of my bill for the first couple times but after that they told me that they were valid roaming charges. The last time that it happened I got a roaming charge from taking an incoming call in a local bar that I was in. I called and told them what happened. The rep told me that it was a valid charge and I told him I wanted to speak to a supervisor because I was really getting sick of these roaming charges. She of course told me that it was a valid charge and that the map of my service area was a guideline. I guess that means that the map doesn't mean anything. She told me that there was no way they were going to take the charges off of my bill. I asked her when my contract was up and she told me that it was up a month ago. The next day I had cell phone service through a different carrier. Cell One better do something different because I know of 4 other people that have switched from their service to another in the last 2 months because of the same type of problems.
