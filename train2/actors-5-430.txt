after watching othello and hamlet, i must say that for his time, he was unmatched. It seems that time somehow manisfests pop for greatness. From Twain, to the popcorn beatles of the 60s, to Chopin, to Madonna, it seems that what is so shallow and I MEAN GABLE, STEWART, etc to be popular becomes great in the eyes of the later generations. I suppose Monroe is in the top 10 for actresses? Give me a break. Use your head. Olivier was unsurpassed and he was innovative. In the past era, only Brando came close.
