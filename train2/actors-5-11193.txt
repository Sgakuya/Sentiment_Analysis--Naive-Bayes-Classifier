I just returned from Moulin Rouge to tell the RIA world that Nicole Kidman is now my favorite (modern) actress, and I am about to give her the highest compliment I can give: The best parts of her performance in Moulin Rouge remind me of nothing so much as Ann Margaret in Viva Las Vegas, which is for Rub the greatest exhibition of female charisma to ever be unleashed on screen. Kidman, however, is a very close rival to the master. How tragic that she's back on the market right after Ruby gets married?
