 The Adventures of Robin Hood , The Sea Hawk , Captain Blood - films like these used to thrill me to bits when I was a young lad. I shall always be grateful to Errol Flynn for the entertainment value of these pictures. He had a terrific screen presence and it was a great shame that he seemed to degenerate as he got older and he appeared to waste his talents as alcohol got the better of him.
