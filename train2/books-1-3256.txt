I love Dean Koontz (see my comments on WATCHERS), but FALSE MEMORY was a brutal assault on my senses. I honestly think that women who have been raped and/or sexually abused (especially if they are in therapy!) should avoid this book. I didn't make it halfway through, and it disgusted my husband so much, we got rid of it.
