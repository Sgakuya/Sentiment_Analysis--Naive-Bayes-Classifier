I can't stand his accent. His range and ability are still very good. The number of classic movies I enjoy that featured him are enormous. MY two favorites are These Wilder Years which is not one of his better known films and his role in Mr Roberts. Mr Roberts is an all around fantastic film and Cagney as the mean spirited captain is a main reason why.
