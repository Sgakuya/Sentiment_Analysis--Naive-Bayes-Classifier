Funnier than John Kerrys political stance. If Burt could lose the bad rug, and get a better weave people wouldn't be so distracted by it and would concentrate on his performance. I like this actor and wish he'd get offered a series for TV or a decent movie role...He's just naturally funny and a true gem from the 70's...Would love to see him paired back up with Sally Feilds in a (non)-Smokey& the Bandit movie...
