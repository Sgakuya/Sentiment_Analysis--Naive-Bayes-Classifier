I am certain that if this book were more widely read, and not just by people like myself who would have read it anyway, perhaps endorsed a bit more and [GASP!] read in schools, this country's skyrocketing idiot quotient would see a drastic decline. And I've got to side with TheFreak on this one: yes john430et, do read the book, of course only after you have undergone the prerequisite head from anus extraction procedure which is relatively painless and quite refreshing, really. All of you morons who equate Rand with fascism or focus too heavily upon the egotism of her work are missing the point: that unless people show a little more concern for the work that they do and where it gets them, the looters/Clintons of the world will ultimately destroy the economy and the very idea of the individual and his ability to support himself without the benevolent aid of Big Brother and his myriad social programs and socialist propaganda. Anyone who does NOT wish to see this nation become a state of touchy-feely do-gooders that care more about intent, feelings, and meaning well more so than about actions and results absolutely must read this.
