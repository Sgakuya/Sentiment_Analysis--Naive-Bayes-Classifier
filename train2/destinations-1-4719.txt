One of the worst cities in the US. The city proper is a wasteland. Huge, wide boulevards with little traffic and abandoned buildings and empty lots over most of the city. Awful public transit for a major city and not very pedestrian friendly. The outlying areas are in better shape than the city proper but its typical boring suburban strip mall culture. Detroit has loads of potential and may one day become a pretty good place to live and visit like it once was, but in 2004 it is well below average when compared to other US cities.
