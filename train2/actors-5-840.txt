Al Pacino is an acting LEGEND! His acting ability will be remembered LONG AFTER he is gone. His ability to place himself within his role and character is flawless. You can FEEL the sincerity and energy oozing off the movie theatre screen. I LOVE his accent and inflection, as well. Just a PHENOMENAL actor in EVERY respect!
