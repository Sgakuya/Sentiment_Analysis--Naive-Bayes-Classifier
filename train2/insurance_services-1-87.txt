Mistakeningly signed on and cancelled within five minutes. Still unresolved. They billed me 10% ($332.00 of future preimun value on Amex Card. No refund yet. They continue to charge $900 month after month. Very difficult, unorganized company to deal with. You e-mail them to death and they don't read them.
