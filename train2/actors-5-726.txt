At his peak, he was the highest paid actor in Hollywood, and along with Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood, was the top action actor of his day. No actor ever oozed masculinity quite like Bronson. This was a man's man. His work covered every genre in film. My favorite Bronson movie is Hard Times, a gritty depression era movie, about a pick up fighter. He was never more Bronsonish than in this movie. The man is a legend.
