I'll always treasure Janeane. She's got the goods to back herself up. Smart, acerbic, and fairly good-looking when she peeks out from under the glower and the camera focuses. Progressive-minded, but still not daring enough to dive off the high board (office politics suck). Keeps getting work, and is taken for granted by all the wrong folks.
