Looks like a scumbag and off camera seems to be out in leftfield, but check out his performances in movies and he's really talented and has come across well in some good roles. On acting alone he's four stars. *********UPDATE************* Sean Penn Goes up a Star and maybe even One more for actually going to New Orleans, getting in a boat and looking for Hurricane survivors. Lots of people talk the talk, yet Penn actually is doing something tangible and real about the tragedy as well.
