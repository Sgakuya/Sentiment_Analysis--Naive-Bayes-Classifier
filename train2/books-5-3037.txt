Reading this book scared me more than any other book or any movie for that matter. Like all King's books, it is long, but it goes by quickly because you can't put it down. The story is terrifying especially because it is told through the eyes of a five-year-old boy. We can feel his fear and vulnerability through the excellent storytelling of King. I read this book when I was too young, eleven, and I was haunted for years!
