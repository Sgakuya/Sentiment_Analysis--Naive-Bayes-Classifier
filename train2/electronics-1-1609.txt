Beware of this TV!! Don't get me wrong, the picture is great and flat screen is great too. I really liked the way DVDs looked on this TV. Menus are rich, you can tweak a lot. Sound quality is not all that great, but is OK. HOWEVER, this TV is of V*E*R*Y poor quality. Sony evidently does not care about quality any more. I mean - I go through 4 TVs in total within 30 days??? Within a month, I went through 3 Sony Wegas, as I had to take them back because of pink stripes and then lastly (just today) because the right bottom corner turned green. I have no speakers around my TV, and they tried to degauss it, and it was still green. This happened on the 29th day since I bought the TV - so I replaced it with a JVC. Calling Sony customer service? Good luck... after endless navigation through phone menus, you get a busy signal. And I tried more than once too... No more Sony - no thanks. Dragging this thing to the store for 3 times, exchanging it every time... I did not need this any more. It might be just flat screen models that have problems, but I am not willing to try...
