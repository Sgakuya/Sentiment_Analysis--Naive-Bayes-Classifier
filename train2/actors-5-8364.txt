If you judge her by the standard for her era in the movie industry, she's tough (if not impossible) to beat. Even if you judge her on her own merits (i.e., objectively with no reference to the culture of the times) she's spectacular. She knew how to act - not like some of the cardboard cutouts that "grace" today's movies, who rely on being real smart-asses with not enough money, apparently, to buy clothes that will cover more than 23% of their bodies. Don't get me wrong - I am not being sanctimonious here (at least, I don't think so), but we're talking about acting ability.
