Halle Berry is walking in her calling, this is not a mistake by any means. People are making alot of comments about her race, skin color and features and trying to determine that this is why Halle is where she is today. If each person will sit back for just a moment and think the average person tries to take pride in how they come to work. It is only natural for her to want to look her best, this enables her to be her best. It does not matter about the race of her parents beauty comes from within, you can take a not so beautiful person with a beautiful spirit inside and that person can draw you near. You will say something like this there's something about that person that I really like. Then you can take a beautiful person with a spirit that will send you running in the other direction no matter how beautiful they are on the outside. I have never met Halle in person but I see and feel something from her that draws you near and it's coming from within. She's a human being and a child of God. I'm of light and cocoa color and so are my kids. When I look at another person I see the person and not their color I'm not bound by color and neither is Halle haven't you figured that out by now! Halle took the time to acknowledge other black women, Halle is a black woman herself. What's so sad is that people still do not know how to let people be just who they are. But the real truth is just this this is her time! And God is good all the time and all the time God is good. Blessings to Halle and her family!
