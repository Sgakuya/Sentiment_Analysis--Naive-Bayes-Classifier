This should be right at the bottom of all US states. Vastly overrated on this site. Arguably the most screwed up politics in the US. People still debate over evolution! Scary. Like Oklahoma, all of the ignorance of the deep south with none of the charm. Only upside is a suprising number of innovative businesses started here.
