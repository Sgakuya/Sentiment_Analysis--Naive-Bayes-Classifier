The most artificial, soulless city in Florida. Nothing but identical strip malls, apartment complexes and housing subdivisions that look exactly the same. It may just be me but there seems to be alot of creepy people here, I don't know. Of course the one thing it has going for it is the warm Florida weather, but the beaches are not that great, you can find better beaches anywhere else in Florida.
