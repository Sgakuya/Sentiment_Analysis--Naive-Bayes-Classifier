My dad bought me a Saturn for graduation in 1992 before all the marketing hype (how embarrassing to be constantly asked if I went to Tennessee!). Shortly thereafter the problems started. With a little research online you can find plenty of evidence that Saturns have a history of excessive oil consumption - my 92 SL2 is a total lemon - blown head gasket, six alternators and a plethora of other problems with less than 60,000. The dealer has not been helpful - saying that a blown head gasket at 57,000 miles is not uncommon (well for Saturns maybe!). Check out the Saturn lemon site for more information http://www.saturnexposed.com and also see http://www.webbbox.com/business/s/saturn.htm for more detail on problems with Saturns. DON'T BUY SATURN - GET A TOYOTA INSTEAD!!! Greasergrrl http://www.greasergrrls.com
