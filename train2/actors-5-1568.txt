Supercool.From back in the shadowy day as smooth Easy Reader on The Electric Company into the light of his heyday,he's a marvel. However some of the ones that have brought him alot of attention have been inflated in importance and some of the smaller roles, the overlooked things are his greatest. On occasion all it takes is his voice.As a narrator or a character...so much authority in those mellow tones.I recommend everyone see Street Smart , Nurse Betty , The Long Way Home , Seven , Glory , Attica , The Power Of One ,as well as the more widely known The Shawshank Redemption with Tim Robbins, Unforgiven Amistad and Deep Impact (which after repeated viewing I find to be a bit of a downer--o well it's about the end of the world is all!). Any way you can see 'em,obscure movies or popular just see 'em.This actor has a quality of grace and self possession matched by few.
