Hi All So glad to see that i am not the only person that has been royally screwed with poor customer serive from telus. I am so angry that I have filled a complaint with the souther ontario better business bureau...who at telus told me doesn't exist yet they are a member of it. Also i am sick to death of their attitudes of customer care people. One dude who would not share his name also told me that I need to learn to move along and let things go. From a care perrson, this is foolish. I dont want money back, just a written apology which they say they will never do. Screw you telus.
