number 1, her role in Tea Sympathy continues to degrade gay people to this day; number 2, she cannot sing; number 3, i never thought i would see the day that this paper-thin actress would top any poll except blandest, most white-bread 1950's actresses; number 4, higher than Judy or Bette?!? puh-leeze!
