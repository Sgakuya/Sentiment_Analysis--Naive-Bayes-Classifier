The first time I saw Roberto Benigni was in the film Il Mostro . I felt like I was watching Charlie Chaplin in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Naturally I wanted to see more. So far I have seen Johnny Stecchino , Down By Law , The Son of the Pink Panther , Night on Earth , and La Vita e Bella . And although some of the movies are better than others, I have never been disappointed with his performances. His charm, wit, and enthusiam shines through in any role he plays.
