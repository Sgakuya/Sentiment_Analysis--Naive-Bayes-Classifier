Wow. Leave it up to GM to screw up a classic. Whereas the old Monte Carlos of yore were distinctive and elegant, the new Monte comes up short. It looks funny. What's up with those arches over the wheel wells and the weird looking looking front and rear fascias? The new Monte looks like several different designs thrown together. Pop open the Monte's hood and once again we find the ancient 3800 Series II V6 pushrod engine. Is this the only powerplant GM makes? The 3800 powers not only the Monte but another dozen GM cars: The Pontiac Bonneville/Grand Prix, Buick Regal/LeSabre/Park Avenue, Chevrolet Impala and up until recently the Oldsmobile Intrigue. Great job overall with the new Monte GM. Keep up with the weird designs and antiquated technology and THAT should help you regain lost market share from the imports.
