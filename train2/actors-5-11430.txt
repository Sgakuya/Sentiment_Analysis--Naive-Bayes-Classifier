She strikes me as a woman who will bend a man's ego over backwards just because she can, and I'm one of those men who enjoys combat with an intellectual female mind. I suppose that's why I find her so appealing. She's tough. She's firm and diligent. She knows what she wants and no oe can tell her otherwise. She seems to put a lot of her own self being into roles and i admire that. I think that everyone can learn a lot from her. Perhaps men most of all. Her attitude is like many women I've known, You better watch what you say and watch what you do because you're being graded all the time. She has deliberate elfinlike features and eyes that are both abrasive, yet warm. I like the tone in her voice. It is both attractive and controlling. I don't like scenes in movies where I see her getting hit. It bothers me, even if it is necessary for the story. I like to see her fight and win. If she's in passionate scenes she needs to be the one in control. It just makes sense. I think in 'Ruby in Paradise' she stole all the attention in that movie. In 'Kiss the Girls' she was a toughy and it came off very well. In 'A Time To Kill' she looked authorative and sensuous. In 'The Passion of Darkly Noon' she was both feline and a sexual tease that is fed with female anxiety, a very good movie. I say that Ashley Judd is a true talent and I'm glad she's famous and making movies.
