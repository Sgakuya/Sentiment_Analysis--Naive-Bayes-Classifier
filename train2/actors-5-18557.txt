Such great directors. From Blood Simple, through Raising Arizona, to Lebowski and on and on. These guys are masters of intelligent humor without falling victim to senseless slapstick. I have not disliked any of their movies. While most of their movies, like the Big Lebowski, are full of hilarious dialogue, Blood Simple, their first movie (i believe) is so quiet, yet equally as impressive of a movie. A lesser known of their movies, but a must see.
