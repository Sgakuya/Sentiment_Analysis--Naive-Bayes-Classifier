I have enjoyed Brad Pitt since he guest starred on the TV shows Growing Pains and Dallas . I knew that I was seeing the beginnings of a star. He has tremendous talent and versatility. And as a lot of people will agree hs is very handsome but he is not afraid to not be as in Kalifornia or 12 Monkeys . And he seems to be a very genuine, nice person.
