When so many people are miserable, there is always room in my bookshelf for a book on how to find happiness. Mind you I realize that this book isn t going to make you happy by just reading it, but it might help you find a bit of useful and insightful information. It s not a book that should be rushed through, like most of this genre, it should be slowly absorbed in order to get the most out of it. I liked it very much.
