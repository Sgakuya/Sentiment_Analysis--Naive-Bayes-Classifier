THE worst, bar none. Makes Doris Day look like Katharine Hepburn, in terms of talent. Is also the Hollywood actress I would LEAST like to have lunch with, knowing we'd spend the whole time speaking of her (terrible) movies, (negligible) talent and (badly overrated) physical appearance. In Moore, we have an example of a type of woman who is all-too-prevalent in society, and who was the reason so many girls and women loved the movie Carrie. Blessed with a fair amount of facial beauty, and obviously fake breasts which many men (including me) find pitiful, she has coasted through her career on her sexual energy and alleged beauty. Her problem is, our sexist society thinks women lose their looks at a certain point. Obviously not true, but that's the widespread perception. Shorn of her beauty, Moore has nothing to offer us--not likability, not a keen intellect, not altruistic world views, etc. I confess I am a feminist (eek!). Moore is a disgrace to her gender, a woman who would throw us back to the days when women's talent, intellectual prowess and kindness were less important than their looks. And now, despite all the money she spent on them, her looks no longer will enable her to mage huge bucks. What a damn shame! As the great Janis Ian said: A brown-eyed girl in hand-me downs, Whose name I never could pronounce, Said,`Pity please the ones who serve; They only get what they deserve, In debentures of quality, And dubious integrity. `The small-town eyes will gape at you, In dull surprise when payment due, Exceeds accounts received, at 17.' Poor, poor Demi.
