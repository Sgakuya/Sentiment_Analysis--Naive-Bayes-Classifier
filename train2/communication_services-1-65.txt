HORRIBLE!! They charged me each month for long distance I never signed up for. I called each month to get them to take it off - they credited my account after about 20 minutes of talking with a supervisor and said that it was cancelled. Well, until I got my next bill at least. Then I would get charged again! I grew tired of calling so I called to cancel my service, only to get hung up on by a representative!!! Outrageous! I called back and cancelled. I hope I never have to deal with these people again. Qwest SUCKS!
