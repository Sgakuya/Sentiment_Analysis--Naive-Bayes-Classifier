he is totally great and the show is better than ever with the whole jason/sam/sonny storyline!! its going great! Keep it up!:) as for this quote: Steve Burton has zero expression, zero depth, and zero interest in being an actor hello if you knew the show you would know that the whole zero expression is the way his character is...he isn't suppose to feel....hello memory loss storyline...and the acting part you don't know him, maybe you should read up on his bio, his done movies, taken the series and what not...thats pretty low of speaking for him saying he doesn't want to be an actor and its just for the money....wow is that jealousy?
