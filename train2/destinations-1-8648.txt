Comparing the merits of smokeless tobacco products is like comparing which "Dirty Sanchez" looks the best on skanks. I was helping coach my son's Flag Football team this year and always seemed to attract the attention of "Skoal Guy." Dude would always come my way with a big wad of chaw in his grille and bend my ear over meaningless minutae. Most of the time, he would complain why the team's blocking was preventing his son (a fullback) from breaking any big plays [The actual reason was Dude's son was slow, clumsy, and uncoachable]. Every 20 seconds, he would launch a fusillade of nefarious brown saliva out of his mouth -- some too close to my proximitiy for my comfort. As soon as he stopped jabbering out of his spit hole, I would conveniently say, "Excuse me, I got to run some drills" and jog away smartly.
