I think one of the greatest talents in an actor, is making an audience believe in something, or someone, using only facial expressions...no words required. Well, russell sure does an excellent job at that, and not only is he incredibly georgious, he is smart, passionate about acting, and funny as hell!! To see him act totally hilarious, watch 'The Sum of Us . Not only is he fabulous in it, the moral of the movie is great, and he has some nice scenes with a man.....ladies, he is NOT gay!!! very convincing though!!!!.....
