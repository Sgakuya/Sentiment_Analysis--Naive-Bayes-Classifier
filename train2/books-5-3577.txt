a startling and stark novel dealing with the complexities of human desire and consequence. plays like a morality play, in a way, b/c of dostey's devote catholicism, but for the most part is an honest effort to show the cause on one human beings disastrous mistake brought on by need and curiosity and how the reprecussions of said decision plague the mind. i dont want to say much here b/c i do not want to divulge the plot. but this novel should be read and read again, and studied in terms of the innerworking of the human psyche.
