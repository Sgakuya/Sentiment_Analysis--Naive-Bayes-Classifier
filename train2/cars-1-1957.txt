What a piece of junk beware of these cars if it says year 2000 they really are only 1997 models Built around the blueprints of Vauxhall Astras using cheaper materials and when I say cheaper I mean scrapping the barrel im unlucky to have bought one three weeks ago and have found now the car is worth less than half of what I purchased it for from a garage I have had to replace in two weeks the door winders in-side the doors(£110 each) the Idle valve (£150) if you want a “MONEY PIT” Daewoo have the answer my advice stay well well clear and thank god for large mercy’s
