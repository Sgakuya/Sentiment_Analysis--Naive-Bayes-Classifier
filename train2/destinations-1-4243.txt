California is a beautiful state, but its capital is an eyesore. I've been in Sacramento in June, and it felt more like Mississippi than Cali: hot, humid and bugs everywhere. Bonus: it gets freezing cold in the winter, apparently!There's no reason to visit this dump except on business, and the cost of living isn't much lower than in coastal California, so why would you want live there?
