He is a very versatile actor, he has acted in drama's, comedies, romance, action. He has played the gentleman, the lover, the lawyer, the bad cop, the rich business man. You have seen him angry, you have seen him smile that his eyes light up, you have seen him solemn, you have seen him being a lover, you have seen him kick ass, and you have seen him cry. I have watched all his movies, From Officer and a Gentleman to his current one showing in South Africa, Autumn in New York. I love watching his movies as he shows feeling. (and he reminds me of my eldest sons father who is about the same age as Mr Gere.)
