Paris, France, invaded by Nazi's... liberated by America, now in hatred of America. The French need to learn the definition of loyalty. Disagreeing with the war is one thing, but trying every way possible to prevent what the US thinks is right is outrageous. They just didn't disagree with us- they went completely against us. 55% of French citizens wanted Americans to lose the fight in Iraq. They also said that they would come help us if Saddam used weapons of mass destruction, weapons that would have the names of French companies all over them. Idiots.
