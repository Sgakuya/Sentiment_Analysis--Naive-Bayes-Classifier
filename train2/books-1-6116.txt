That's the silliest thing I've ever seen. To say that the White House reviewed Clarke's book and told him what to leave in and remove is ridiculous. In this country we have what's called freedom of speech and freedom of the press which means you have a right to publish anything about anyone or anything. Yes, four presidents have picked Clarke to defend our country against terrorists. The 9/11 attacks as well as a dozen or so attacks throughout the 90's happened under Clarkes watch and he's just trying to shift the blame onto Bush. This is an election year. Clarke is just a puppet for Kerry.
