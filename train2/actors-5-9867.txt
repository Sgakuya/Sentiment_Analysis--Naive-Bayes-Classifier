Apart from being a very talented actress and a fine singer (when she`s had the chance), the impression I get from Sissy Spacek when watching her films is that she`s a beautiful person, in more ways than one. Quite unique in a strangely attractive way, and hard not like, or feel some emotion for at least in anything she`s ever done. Love her to bits!
