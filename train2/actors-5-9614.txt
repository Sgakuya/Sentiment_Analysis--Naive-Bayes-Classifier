Catherine Zeta Jones is so beautiful! If I could look like anyone, it would be her because she has the most exotic and elegant look that any girl could ever ask for. On top of being absolutely gorgeous, she's talented, which is a rarity amongst a lot of actors/actresses today. I do admit some of her roles left a bit to be desired, but she shines in whatever she does. I would not be surprised to see her get an Oscar.
