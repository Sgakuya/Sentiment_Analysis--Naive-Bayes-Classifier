one of the better kid actors of the 1960s to 70s {mostly 60s} He appeared in Lost in Space and many guest appearances on tv. I really liked him in the Twilight episode of It's A Good Life. where he was this evil little boy who could wish people into the corn field if they did anything to displease him. He was an adorable boy with a lot of acting talent.
