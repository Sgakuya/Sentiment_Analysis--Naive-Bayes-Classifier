George Clooney is an awesome actor that is improving as the years go by. George is also my fav actor and role model. Not only is he handsome, but he is also smart as far as in the business which he has shown with the past movie choices such as: Out of Sight, Three Kings, O' Brother Where Art Thou?, and his new movie he's working on (which I'm sure will be a hit!) Ocean's 11. George is soooo cool and down to earth. He's a great person as well as a great actor! Sketch*
