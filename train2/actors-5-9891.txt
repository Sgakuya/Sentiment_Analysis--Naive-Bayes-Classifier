Astoundingly nasty in Dangerous Liasons, and strangely sympathetic in Fatal Attraction (I've never liked Michael Douglas anyway - he should have kept his scrawny a** covered in Basic Instinct). Bless the way she chews the furniture in 101 Dalmations - she and Tim Curry are two actors who know how to ham it up and have a GOOD TIME!
