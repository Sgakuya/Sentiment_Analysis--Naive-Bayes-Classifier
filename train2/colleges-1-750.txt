For the sake of time - I will not comment on quality of education - let's assume it is OK compared to it's competitors. The adminstration of the school needs to get fired. The programs change frequently and these changes are not understood by the staff of the school leaving the learner to pay tuition while these items get sorted out. The school has no interest in customer satisfaction and does a superior job of recrutiment - but makes no committment to it's current learners who are often left to sort out the schools issues and pay ridiculous amounts of tuition. The school never admits fault - desipte its frequent unorganization. Considering it has a business school - it is one of the most poorly run business I have ever been associated with. I would not recommend Capella to ANYONE. There are better institutions out there.
