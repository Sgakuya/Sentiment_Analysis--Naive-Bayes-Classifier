I love Matt LeBlanc- he is so hot and he seems like such a sweetie too. he's one of my favorite actors. i think Joey is the most lovable character on Friends but the real Matt seems like a genuinely sweet, kind person, and actually pretty intellegent too. he is the type of guy i think would make the perfect boyfriend- becuase he's sweet, kind, and funny, and real and totally adorable.
