Of all the ratings I have made thus far, and of all the one's I will ever make, This one is the most important. Courteney Cox Arquette is not only my all time favorite actress, she is the best actress on television today. I have been a fan of hers for years, since friends came out. I am her #1 fan, and a huge CeCe memorobillia collector. SHE ROCKS ALL!
