An unapologetic look at war as it really is, through the eyes of the utterly unique Billy Pilgrim who has come unstuck in time. By far my favorite Vonnegut, it is certainly the most personal statement by that sometimes maddening, and always iconclastic author. In this book he recounts, through layers of third-person distance and scathing irony, his own apocalyptic experience as a prisoner of war in Dresden, the scene of the most horrific single massacre of human beings in one day in the 20th century, the fire bombing in February 1945 by the Allies. It's a powerful book: don't miss it. Note to Moosekarloff: it's not a science-fiction book; the time-travel is a metaphor, not to be taken literally. When you look into the abyss, you may see something too terrible to face, and need to escape in any way you can. Unstuck in time says it better than I can.
