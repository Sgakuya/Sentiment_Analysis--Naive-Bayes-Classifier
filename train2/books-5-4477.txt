I love books that can honestly capture or portray the feelings of the characters involved, or the setting to me. I felt the gang bombers conviction, independence, dedication to duty, and willingness to die for his cause. I could see it's beautiful scenery of the Spanish countryside, feel the cold, smell the trees. An excellent read, brings me to a far off time and place.
