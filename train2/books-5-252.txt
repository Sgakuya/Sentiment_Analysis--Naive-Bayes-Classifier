This book really changed my life. It opened my eyes to eating disorders and my own weird food obsessions. I think every girl/woman should read this, because she will see herself in Marya and her actions. I never really though before about *how* I eat, meaning all the odd things that I do to food, or foods I won't eat (for whatever reason), or foods I eat obsessively. Marya's book takes us on a vivid journey down the spiral staircase into the pit of hell that it can be to be a woman today. It's brutally honest and will change the way you view the media, the mental health field, parenting, and women today.
