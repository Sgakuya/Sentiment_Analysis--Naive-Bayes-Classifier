Another reason everyone should stay out of the south. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina is ok because the outsiders and tourists have taken it over. However, outside of that city is a different story. In Michigan, I rarely, if ever, encounter racism. In Ohio, the racism rate jumps. By South Carolina, it happens very often. On a family trip eight or so years ago or more, we stopped off into Sparky's Roadside Joint or something like that off the interstate near the border of SC. My mom, brother and I went to get some ice cream. This woman apparently was working on something in the kitchen and couldn't help us. We waited until she finished. Finally, a white girl came in and the woman started serving her! Three or four more customers came in and got served, but not us! Finally, I had to calm my mom and brother down and leave the store, angry myself too, before we had a fit and gave the rednecks reason to pull their shotguns out and gun us down! After that, I decided I'd never again come back to the Confederated State of South Carolina! Enjoy Dixie and Jim Crow folks, I'm never coming back!
