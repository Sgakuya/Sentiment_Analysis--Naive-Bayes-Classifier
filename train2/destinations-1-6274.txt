The horrible state that I made the mistake of moving to for a year. I lived in Charlotte. I also went to the triangle plenty of times. And I don't know what you people are talking about. Raleigh-Durham is a lifeless, materialistic, yuppie-filled, wannabe rich, generic place just like Charlotte. Yes, the two urban areas are the opposite of the rest of the state, but it is so far the opposite that is equaly as bad.
