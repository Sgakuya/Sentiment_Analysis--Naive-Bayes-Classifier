Reading the book was a whole lot better than watching the 1988 Live Action and the early 80's animation movie of the same title. The story of kids finding a new world just by going through a wardrobe is pure imagination beyond belif and not only living in that world growing up to adults to go back through the wardrobe as kids again. What a very imaginative and very creative story. What it was the best part of the story is how C.S. Lewis parrells the book with Christianity. You can see the simiarlities like the Lion being sacraficed for the Son Of Adam and arose after being sacraficed. It is a great heart telling story.
