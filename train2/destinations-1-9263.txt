i hope everyone knows that lucy maude ripped this story of the chick that wrote _____ of sunnybrook farms...but you never hear that...i live on the island and sure it's a beautiful place but that anne house...what a joke...some1 just burned it down recently and it was never much to look at anyway.i can't get over the amount of money and time that's wasted here advertising this stupid book.if your gonna come to the island...come for the beaches,the tranquility,and the seafood...but don't waste your time or money takin some stupid tour to the anne house where your host will be a 16 year old who know's about as much about the real story as i know about writing comments
