I have loved the choices of movies Jennifer has made....she was wonderful in House of Sand and Fog, A Beautiful Mind, Requiem for a Dream. And she is not afraid to try a wipeout like The Incredible Hulk. When you allow for her age and also look at pictures of her as a younger woman, I still find her to be the most beautiful woman on earth. To be fair, I am partial to women with prominent thick eyebrows, like Jennifer and Brooke Shields....I like the sort of untamed eyebrow look....Oh yeah, Inventing the Abbots. Well, I am obviously taken beyond reason,so I will just quit now.
