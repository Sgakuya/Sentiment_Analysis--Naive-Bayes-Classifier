When I first heard about this book, my first instincts were..uh uh chick book. However, curiosity got the better of me and I read it. The story is excellent. Katharine Flannagan moves to the Canadian North in the beginning of the 1900's and meets Mike. Mike, a Canadian Mountie is the epitome of strength, courage and wisdom..not seen today very much. The obstacles Mike and Katharine encounter, combined with the raw wilderness and survival required to live there that makes this a good book for guys too.
