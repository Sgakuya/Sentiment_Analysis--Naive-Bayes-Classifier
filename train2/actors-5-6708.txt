Given the fact that Sean Hayes is not actually gay in real life makes it that much more amazing that he can portray a gay man with such enthusiasm and talent like that on Will Grace. He is has one of the funniest characters on the show, and it is no wonder he won the Emmy. This is a man to watch. http://geoff.homepage.com/
