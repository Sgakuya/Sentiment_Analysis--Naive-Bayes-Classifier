Can you say: Cracked exhaust? Malfunctioning speedometer? Cracked distributor cap? Window sliding off track? Bad 02 Sensor? Leaking AC sysem? In doing "after the fact" research I discovered these are "common problems" for my 1998 Civic LX. Depending on who you talk to and on what day, Honda may or may not acknowlege the issue and or offer assistance. The dealer parts are expesnive, but this applies to ALL CAR MAKERS. Other than these issues and "sheet metal" that dimples if you stare at it hard enough, the car has been reliable.
