people need to stop hating on this woman. So what if she is biracail(and connects more with being black). Her mother raised her as a black woman because the world only sees color. and you people must not see how much she loves her mom. And as for monster ball I could agree with you it was explicit, but let me tell you something it's real life whether you like it or not, so get over it. She has so much going for her. And don't hate on her because she has the best features of both worlds (white and black).
