Tiresome, boring, flaccid, ineffectual actor. Annoying, pretentious voice. Why was he cast in My Fair Lady? The guy can't sing at all, and whenever you have a lead in a musical talking through his/her songs, you've got a second rate performance going. No emotional depth as an actor, no spirit, no color, no fire, no sense of comedy. A total zero.
