John Wayne made movies that were a lot different than the movies today. In his movies you always knew the good guys and the bad guys. In his movies you always knew the bad guys were done for. In his movies you knew might made right, and The Duke would always come out on top. I wish they made that kind of movies today, but in the real world it doesn't always end the way we want it. I can still remember John Wayne advertising for Camel cigarettes. Years later, after his lung cancer surgery, I can remember his commercials for the Cancer Society, when he said the line I've licked the big C . Then, later, the cancer came back and claimed him as a victim. Then I knew that no matter how big and strong you are, the good guys don't always come out on top.
