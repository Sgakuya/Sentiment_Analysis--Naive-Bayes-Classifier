Citibank it the worst student loan lending group in the history of academics. Their customer support people respond generically with poor grammar and sentence structure. I have had to ask a simple questions, such as, "Is my loan now in defferment" at least three times before I get a response that somewhat resembles a coherent email. Dealing with them enrages me and I suggest that no one should ever go through it willingly. They are both terrible and pathetic. A true group of morons.
