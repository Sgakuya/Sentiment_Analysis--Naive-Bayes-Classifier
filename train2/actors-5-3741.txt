As an actor and writer, I find that severe scrutiny is an undulating force that drives us to achieve greater things. Gary Oldman is one actor, I have noticed, that has suffered this plight as much as any other for no reason I can understand. I have seen every movie he has appeared in, from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead to Sid and Nancy to True Romance . The only consistency between each of these roles (or ANY movie he has graced with his involvement) is the name in the credits. He harbors more personalities than the file cabinet in Alfred Adler's office. What else is an actor, anyway?
