Orwell's vision of our collective future is closer to reality than many realize or want to admit. He wrote this as someone who has been high and inside the British establishment and by extension, among many of the political elite's push towards a singular world government. "Orwellian" and "Big Brother" are common terms in today's language because of this seminal book. It can be argued that he had his date wrong but 1984 is a reality in many parts of the world today. This work, along with Animal Farm serve as a warning to those who are willing to pay attention.
