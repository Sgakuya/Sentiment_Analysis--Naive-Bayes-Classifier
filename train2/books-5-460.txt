I always used to read Charlotte's Web aloud to my classes of second-graders, and they absolutely loved the story. While many of them had seen the movie, very few had read the book. E.B. White's staggering talent always made a huge impression, and the kids grew very attached to all of the characters by the end of the story. I guess I did, too, because I always got a bit choked up as I read about Charlotte's fate! One year I took my class to see a play based on the book, and we all agreed that nothing could beat actually reading it.
