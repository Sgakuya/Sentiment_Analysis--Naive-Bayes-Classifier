As many critics have said and some comments have noted, Orson Welles was a story of early blazing achievement yet long-term missed opportunities and what ifs. Welles' greatest artistic achievement as a film director was the universally critically acclaimed Citizen Kane (1941). The movie evidenced Welles' imagination and avant-garde philosophy (eg his use of deep focus and a non-linear format for the story). Notwithstanding his ultimately failed potential, Welles' work is still studied in film schools across the globe, and his films were and remain influential on movie directors of all subsequent time periods and in all genres (eg film noir).
