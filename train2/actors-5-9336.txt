I really like Diane Keaton. Sure, she often plays the same type of role, but I can overlook that because she's consistently very entertaining and she plays more realistic women, as opposed to glamorous, cookie cutter types. Diane Keaton is one of the few actresses I've seen who seems to be comfortable with her age, which is very unusual in our youth-obsessed culture. I loved her performances in Annie Hall (of course!), Crimes of the Heart, and Manhattan Murder Mystery. If a movie stars Diane Keaton, I'll be sure to see it.
