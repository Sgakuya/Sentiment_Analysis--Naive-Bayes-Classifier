This is the best cartoon ever...it is full of compassion, care, and the knowledge that pets can give us what we can never find elsewhere...unconditional love, idolization , and loyalty, regardless of what mood we are in, if we are having a bad hair day, or if we got a bad hair cut...even when late, all they ahve is pure joy that we are home...nothing could be better! Raising Duncan captures all of this...he knows what is truly important...Kathleen
