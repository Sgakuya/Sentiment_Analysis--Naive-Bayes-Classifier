David Hyde Pierce is simply the best! Not only has he perfected the role of Niles Crane, he is an incredibly versatile actor on the stage and in movies as well. I saw him on stage in L.A. in Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks and was completely blown away by his talent and range of ability. I only wish more people recognised him for the major talent he is and would offer him more starring roles, rather than just supporting acting jobs.
