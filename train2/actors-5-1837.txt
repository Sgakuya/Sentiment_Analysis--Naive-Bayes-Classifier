One of the few gutsy actors working in contemporary cinema. Here's a guy who could have been content to coast by on his pretty-boy looks, but he doesn't. Can you name another A-list actor willing to appear as a Cuban transvestite? Also, I know people who worked with him on Donny Brasco and they say he is one of the most down-to-earth, regular guys you could meet.
