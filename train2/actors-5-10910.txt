Jennifer Connelly in 'Requiem For A Dream' is exactly the kind of girl I'd give up my seat for on the subway. I know she wouldn't give my gesture a second thought but then again maybe she'd be so touched by my sacrifice that she'd go home, smoke crack and cry softly to herself in the mirror. Jennifer Connelly...you move me.
