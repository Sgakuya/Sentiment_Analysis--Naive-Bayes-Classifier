I don't care about anyone else's opinion. I think Tamara is one of *the* best actresses on daytime and has filled Carly's shoes 100%. She makes Carly so real and plays her so passionately, I wouldn't to Carly played by anyone else. And the chemistry between her and Maurice Benard is phenomenal. Without her, General Hospital would be missing a huge chunk of what makes it the best show on daytime!!!
