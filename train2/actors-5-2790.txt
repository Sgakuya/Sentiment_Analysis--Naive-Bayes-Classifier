Kevin Spacey proved his great acting ability to me when I saw 7even. It was great. So was Midnight in The Garden of Good And Evil. His role in American Beauty was very poignant and a phenomenal phenomenal role. He is a great inspiration to inspiring actors, and his stories about Johnny Carson impersanations are hilarious.
