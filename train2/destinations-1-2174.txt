China is disgusting to say the least. No offense to the Chinese citizens, but its Communist government is just sickening, and I don't think anyone should or could support its tourism, knowing of all the human rights violations that go on over there. The only reason they got the Olympics, is because of its enormous population which would generate lots of income to the official sponsors. All I can say is LET'S BOYCOTT OLYMPICS IN BEIJING 2008!!! Shame on you China!!!
