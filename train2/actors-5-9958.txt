Toni rocks indeed! Very talented and versatile actress who is not afraid to look less-than-glam when the role requires it. Cases in point: Suicidal mum in About a Boy, and dumpy 'best friend' to Gwyneth's Emma. An actress worth of respect and kudos. Recently married (within the last year or so). Keep it coming, Toni!
