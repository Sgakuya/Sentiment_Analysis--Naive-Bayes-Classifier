Only the fact that it's competently drafted stops Rose Is Rose being consigned to oblivion. Competent, but not good. Writing's ordinary too. Looks like it stepped straight out of 1956. I hear that somebody at Brady's syndicate rejected Calvin and Hobbes in favor of Rose Is Rose way back. Wonder if THAT guy's still in a job? These boards seem to be made up of (a) fans voting well in favor of the great strips and (b) creators of bad strips desperately trying to rig the table prior to the next contract negotiations with their syndicates.
