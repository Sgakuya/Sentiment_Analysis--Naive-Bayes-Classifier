Halle Berry is a very good actress and a very beautiful woman. Many very dark skin people do not like her because she is half white, and that makes her complexion light. But even if she had two African American parents who were light skinned,they would say she is not black enough. This is the same reason they had a problem with Vanessa Williams winning the MS, America beauty pagent. They are just jealous! Go Halle, Go Halle, Go Halle!!!
