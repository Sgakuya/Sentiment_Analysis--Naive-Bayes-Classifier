Although she has been in a few Klinkers,Whoopi can act with the best of 'em. She is far more talented than she is generally given credit for. Comic roles are the hardest type to pull off successfully-and she does this with pure genius.She is also fully capable of serious and dramatic roles such as her stunning performance in The Color Purple.
