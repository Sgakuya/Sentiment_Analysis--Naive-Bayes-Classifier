This novel is not only important in a historical context, but for a grasp of middle class vs. aristocracy in a feminine context. This novel is excellently written and emotionally intriguing. It is only at the end of the novel that the title becomes clear, as the novels characters learn about their pride and prejudices and how this has affected their interpersonal relationships.
