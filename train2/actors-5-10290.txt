The other night I watched One Fine Day on TV, only because of Michelle. I sure wish I was George Clooney. After it I felt like going to the video store and hiring some of her films. I could watch her all day. I agree, she is not like Meryl Streep for acting, bad she's not terrible, which doesn't make it bad to watch her all day. For beauty, I think she's up with the most beautiful like Grace Kelly. Her Oscars were for best supporting actress, I presume, but I believe she will one day win the big one, which she will deserve. She has been in the film industry since the eighties, so a big reward for her contribution to the film industry would be deserved.
