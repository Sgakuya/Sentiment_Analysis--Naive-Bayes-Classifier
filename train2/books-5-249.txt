I suffered from this problem. I was so skinny and bony and disgusting! I hated it. My years through middle school sucked. I cried every day. I hated life so much. I identify with Marya. It didn't help when I went to school, My teachers made snappy comments. Let's face it: Anorexia is a terrible, horrible, evil disorder. Teenagers get it the most. Our doctors need to do more. Our community needs to do more to help young girls.
