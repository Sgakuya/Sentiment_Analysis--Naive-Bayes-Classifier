These comments will not contain any humor.Question: What in the world happened to the original diet 7 up? For year I've been a loyal customer, but after purchasing 2 - l2 pack cartons of the NEW 7up with Splenda I could not wait to inform you how bad it really is. So much so, I became nauseous.My diet requires me to have diet soft drinks. This latest receipe will not do it for me.It was purchased at Jewel (Harlem & Foster in Chgo). I returned it with my comments and with the hope the original taste will once more return. If not - you've lost me.
