I can only agree with you all here!!! Cate really doesn't belong to the usual Hollywood-staff and I hope she'll be able to avoid the typical make-your-money-and-run-szene as long as possible. She's just great!!! And even though I know that a Hollywood nomination is no guarantee for a good movie at all(!) I really felt bad that the Oscar went to Ms Paltrow instead:-( Anyways, we know better, don't we?
