Maurice Benard is the best actor in any forum of acting, period! No one even comes close and the fact that he does not have a Daytime Emmy is a joke. I have also seen him in a lot of the outside projects he has done besides daytime and he was phenominal in each and every performance. I was never a big fan of Vanessa Marcil or Sarah Brown until they were paired with him. And now, he and Tamara Braun just sizzle together. The most attractive thing about him, besides his obvious good looks and dimples is that he is simply just a nice guy. I have never read anyone making a bad comment about him. His wife and daughters are very lucky to have him and he is very lucky to have found his wife who comes across as a very special person. I was very disappointed when he left General Hospital the first time and will be again the next time he leaves, but this man needs to be in movies where the world can experience his talent.
