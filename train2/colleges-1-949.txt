I had the distinct impression that most of the instructors did not have the latest information and material in their field. Some of my old instructors in online and face-to-face courses were quite good, but left due to problems with the UMUC administration (payroll, bureacracy, freeway flying, poor benefits, lack of job security, intrusion by area director/program heads in the courses, lack of ability to do their research, etc.). I guess they found better jobs, and left us with the leftovers. The leftover professors didn't seem to convey the course content and material very well. The field reprsentatives, area directors, and program heads didn't listen to student concerns. Given the cost of UMUC, and quality, you're better off checking out other colleges.
