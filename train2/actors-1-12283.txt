Lord, this woman is annoying. I cannot believe they gave her an oscar for that whiny, overwrought, stereotypical performance in Monster's Ball. The only role I have found her convincing in was as a skanky stripper who ended up dead within five minutes in The Last Boy Scout . THat I would believe. She says she doesn't want to play Storm in another X-Men movie. Good. That would leave room for more deserving performers in the role. Like Angela Bassett. Or Thandie Newton. Or Tom Arnold.
