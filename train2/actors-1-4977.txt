Brad Pitt to put it bluntly is just eye candy for women. I know very few men who like him as an actor, I know I don't. Pitt is highly over-promoted and highly over-paid. When his looks fade so may his star-power. I see people on TV and in the movies whose acting is ten times better than that of Pitt's and they don't even get considered as A list stars.
