I just have to say that Tom Cruise is one of the greatest actors of all time and I think it's just wrong that he's in position 31 at the moment! He should be number 1. I haven't seen all of his movies yet but I'm trying hard and I've liked everyone I've seen so far. He deserves a rating 5 more than any one alive. I'm not just saying this because he's is the hottest person to ever bless this earth but also becasue he is an excellent and very talented actor. He absolutely rocks my world, I'd be bored without him to think about all day long. One of the highlights of my life would be to meet him although it will probably never happen at least I can always dream about it. Nicole Kiddman is sooooo lucky, it's just not fair, she gets to see him pretty much every day!!!
