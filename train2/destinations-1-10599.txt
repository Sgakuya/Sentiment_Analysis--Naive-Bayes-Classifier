These things are nasty. They're supposed to be natural and stuff...and they taste that way. Just kind of dirty and low quality, like some guy rolled them in his garage. They often taste stale. And they do smoke pretty hard and burn slow, so I give myself a headache trying to get something out of them half the time. I know people that swear by them, but they're not my thing. A lot of metalheads in my high school seemed to like these.
