Its a little pathetic to waste your time by proclaiming your hate for an established and successful, Emmy nominated actress such as Natalia Livingston. Why don't you focus on establishing your own careers insteading of venting about your jeolousy of someone else's? If you don't like someone, whatever the reason, don't watch their programs or waste your time writing about how much you hate her.
