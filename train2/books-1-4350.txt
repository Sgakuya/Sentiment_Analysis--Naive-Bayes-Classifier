Everyone is sick, a few people are dying; it really sucks, lots of conversation about how it sucks, more conversation about how it sucks, hours and hours of put-you-in-a-coma-talk about how it sucks. Everyone is better. The end. Hard to get into. Hard to finish. Boring, no action, just boring conversation. No real great characters.
