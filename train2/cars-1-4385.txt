I have a 1996 Windstar that I bought brand new in Jan 1997. I have took very good care of it and it has been paid off for over a year now. I have 50,200 miles on it and the Head Gasket just blew. Yeah, I know, surprise surprise! I had no idea there was a problem until this happen to me. I plan to tell everyone that Ford is screwing me over. They are replacing 94 and 95 models but not 96 because they fixed the problem. HA! So exactly when do you think my 1996 engine was made?? Im not stupid and I plan to fight this all the way. $1100 to fix it this time but from what I hear, there will be more problems. UGH!
