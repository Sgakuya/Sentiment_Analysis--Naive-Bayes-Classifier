Well, of course, I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I immiedatly identified with the often mis-understood and highly intelligent Ignatius J. Reilly (which is one of the reason I choose that name for my RIA handle!) This book has a loyal and devout folowing , and it must be read to understand why. Highly amusing, and a great read. There was talk of making a movie out of the book, starring Will Ferrel and Drew Barrymoore, but as I understand it, that deal fell through.
