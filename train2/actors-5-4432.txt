Jason Isaacs has been around for a while, but he has finally stepped into the much-deserved spotlight with his role as Col. William Tavington in this past summer's The Patriot. I strongly recommend checking out every other movie Mr. Isaacs has been in, you won't be disappointed! This actor is phenomenal and I know we're going to see a lot more of him in the future!
