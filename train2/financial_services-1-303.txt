Bottom-Line the WORST financial institution ( and i use the term loosely) that I have ever had the displeasure of doing business with. For over four-years now they have slowly sucked funds from me by means of their (IMO) unethical methods of transaction processing. This past month was the worst. A deposit of $11,000 goes into my account from a Bank of America insurance check. At the branch, at a teller, prior to two-o'clock. Then the next day, to my horror, I discovered that they ran nearly thirty transactions on my account. Anyone wish to make a guess which transaction was the VERY last? Nearly $1000.00 in fees. A phone call to the customer support center located in Charlotte (where i happen to be) yeilded nothing more than a nasty attitude and no help. I even attempted to try and work this out in the branch near my home. the branch manager said she would look into it and give me a callback within the next couple of days. after four days i called her to find she was on vacation. Once she returned she told me that Wachovia was unwilling to help me. When i told her i would then be leaving the bank her reply was simply, okay. If you like watching the rich get richer and the small guys like us pick up the tab then i highly recommend this institution. What i do find humorous about this, is i planned on sinking that entire dollar amount into one of thier investment funds. Guess not. I think I'd rather give it to Bank of America or any small bank not yet affiliated with Wachovia. Good luck to the rest of you!
