As Cameron Crowe said, she was the soul of the movie, Jerry Maguire. I cannot say that She is gorgeous, but it is certain that her performance in Jerry Maguire made all men in trouble feel Dorothy Boyd was the soul mate of themselves. The most important thing we must see is that she is trying to change her images and characters in all movies she stars. I cannot help loving her.
