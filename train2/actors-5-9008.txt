If anyone ever wants to see Streep at her brilliant best just rent out 'Still of the Night' (1981, Just before Sophies Choice) with Meryl opposite Roy Scheider and Jessica Tandy. Now there's film noir for you. Her long monologue scene at the end of the film on a dark balcony with Scheider is one of the most breathtaking pieces of acting in cinematic history. Streep, like modern day luminaries Jessica Lange, Glenn Close and Sigourney Weaver is without peer.
