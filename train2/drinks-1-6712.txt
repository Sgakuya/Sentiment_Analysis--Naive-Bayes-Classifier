This stuff should be renamed power-boot because when I tried it I literally got sick. Its ten times more sticky sweet,syrupy, and carbonated than Gatorade. It is the last thing I want after a grueling workout. I'd get more refreshment from a glass of warm buttermilk. Its the last thing I want to drink period.
