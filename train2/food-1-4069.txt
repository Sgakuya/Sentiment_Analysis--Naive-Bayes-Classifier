If you can believe this... I popped the crispy glazed in my Sharp Carousel microwave and my microwave stopped working well for 8-9 days. I couldnt get the smell out of it even after washing everything down. I noticed that things were taking twice as long as usual. We thought it was dying. I started doing research for a new one around the 6th or 7th day and it started slowly coming back. Now the smell is gone and my microwave is working full power again. Why? I have no idea.
