He is absolulty goreous, takes controvestal roles and demoninates it, and best of all has an opinion. Unlike most of hollywood actors, he has spoken out against things he does not argee with. During his interviews, Depp seems genuinly talking to the interviewer. Not systematically answering their questions with the standard "nice" response. I like that he lives outside of the US, so many celebrities complain about privacy issues yet does nothing. He took action and still is very successful in the US.
