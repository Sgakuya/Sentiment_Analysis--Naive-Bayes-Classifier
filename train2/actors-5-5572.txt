I first watched Pierce Brosnan as the daashing detective Remington Steele . I loved that show and followed his career after Steele . I just knew that he'd make a wonderful James Bond, even before he was chosen as the next Bond. I also followed his personal life, and was saddened to hear about the passing of his wife Cassie to cancer. I am glad that he has found happiness again; losing a spouse is truly a tragedy. Anyway, good luck to Mr. Brosnan; you deserve it.
