I hadn't really heard of her til Shakespeare in Love, only thing I knew about her was that she was engaged to Brad Pitt(she still whines about the fact that they broke up. get over it, he's married and your dating Luke Wilson). I didn't really think her performance was that great, her accent was exagerrated, and she wasn't very convincing, and then 2 months later she won an Oscar, that really should have gone to a REAL talent, Cate Blanchett. not only does Gwyneth have 0 talent, she seems stuck-up, her voice(singing and talking) is highly annoying. I'm sure Gwyneth will be forgotten within 5 years considering only one of the movies that she had the starring role in was a huge success(SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE) and that was thanks to all the Oscar noms.
