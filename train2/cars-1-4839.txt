My Triton blew a spark plug out of the head at 50,000 miles and left me stranded in the middle of nowhere with a boat on the back. This is an obvious factory defect. 3,000 dollars later I no longer trust this truck. Ford knew about this problem and continued to sell these engines because the majority of the plugs blowing out are out of warranty and therefore not their problem. 6.0 diesel?? I dont THINK so! That's an even bigger pile of JUNK. Ford has FINALLY admitted there is a problem by redesigning the heads on the triton ond instituting a massive recall on the '04 and '05 6.0 diesels. They lost a loyal Ford customer here, I will never buy another Ford, I will do my best to alert everyone I know that Ford builds JUNK.
