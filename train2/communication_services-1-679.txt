I think cingular..................sucks D***. The phone is a piece of crap, I get signal NOWHERE, even if it displays 4 bars, when i press send, they dissapear. DO NOT USE SINGULAR. I have used them for about 4 years now, ever since they were bellsouth, and they have never failed to amaze me with how friggen BAD they are. In a nutshell , Cingular Sucks. Cingular sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks...
