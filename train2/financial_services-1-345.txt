I had a First Chicago Account, it got bought out by NBD. NBD got bought out by Bank One. Bank One got bought out by JP Morgan Chase. I have seen my OD fees go from $15 to $30, and now they add a $10 fee at the end of the billing period so it's $40. It's a joint account I have with a parent left over from when I was a minor. I've been out of the state now for six years and they won't let him close the account. So I tried and they wouldn't let me. And every year I pay upwards of $700 in fees to them, but they won't let me leave! It's extortion. Stay away from them!
