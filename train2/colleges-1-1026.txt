Bunch of pigs who make the food clubs a fraternity. yeah, I agree with you folks who say that Princeton students are total snobs who are spoiled. They drive BMW's, benz, ..some even have ROlls Royce!!! Princeton doesn't have a law school, med school....so the graduate program..is basically a laughing stock.
