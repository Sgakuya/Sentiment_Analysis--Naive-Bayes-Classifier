He is old vasion TV. This was back in the day when you could watch tv with out seeing naked bodies and hear cussing. This man was and is a true entertainer. Recentaly he has spoken up about the black community and how they are raising their children. It was not a popular thing to do but he did it because it was right. I have that much more respect for him. Truly a good man.
