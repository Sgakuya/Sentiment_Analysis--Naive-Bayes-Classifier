The funniest screen comic of them all. He made several films that were absolutely hilarious, and he was responsible for many of the screenplays. Man on the Flying Trapeze, The Bank Dick, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man, Never Give a Sucker an Even Break, My Litle Chickadee are all classics. A great eccentric juggler. A master of the comedy of entrapment. His radio performances were also noteworthy and the short The Dentist is a must-see. This guy is never imitated, aped, copied or co-opted because it's virtually impossible to do so and still come off as authemtic as The Great Man himself.
