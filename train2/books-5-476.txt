I got this book as a gift when I was 21, a gift because I loved the original Winnie-the-Pooh cartoon. The book's imaginary world flourishes with imaginative creatures with all their little hang-ups and adorable traits. It's good to have a book where the characters aren't perfect, but are lovable anyway. As an adult, I can appreciate the little things that children might miss, but still enjoy the sweet and innocent world of the Hundred-Acre Wood. If you don't like cute things, then you might not like this; but, this classic is enjoyable for anyone who is young and young-at-heart.
