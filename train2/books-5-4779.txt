This is by far one of the most hilarious books I have ever read. Long live political satire! Jonathan Swift was way ahead of his time! Obviously he wrote a lot of this book while smoking opium, but that's alright, because it's a masterpiece! I'd recommend this to anyone who is smart enough to get the irony in any of Gulliver's situations.
