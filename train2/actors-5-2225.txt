I love Robin! He stole my heart with his sense of humor in Mrs.Doubtfire, then Patch Adams and most recently BiCentennial Man. I think he's a great humanitarian. He is made for the roles he plays because he is, in reality, all of those people in one package. I can't wait to see his next work of art. I hope I get to meet him in person before I die. What a fantastic human being! He deserves not only an Oscar, but a Noble Peace Prize as well.
