I'm not sure if this is in all Sentra's, but I stepped into my girlfriend's '97 ride, and I immediately felt discomforted. The seat is high up from the ground, giving you a little more perspective above the road. However, the roof is built low to the ground. As I sat in the hard, leather seat I felt a sense o claustrophobia overcome me--I felt as if I were being wedged in a tiny box. The exterior design is sleeky yet looks like it got forcibly bent downwards to the earth. Not a pleasant ride, either (on that car the brakes were spongy and the acceleration jerked my neck 180 degrees.
