The single. scariest book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I have read IT three times and love it more each time I do. The characters are all realistic, mostly likeable, and the story is superb. The clown, Pennywise, is one of the scariest bad guys I have ever read. This, to me, is King's masterpiece. There is no doubt who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and you never know if the good guys will win.
