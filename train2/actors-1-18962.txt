More like Michael Moron. His film, obviously edited into oblivion to make his opinion seem right--has just been disproven by Newsweek. Bush was weak for not scaring a group of children at a school? Not a chance. Was part of some club? He just cancelled a large contract of theres! Take a seat, Moore. Better yet, take it in the No-Spin Zone, so all Americans can know how dumb you are!
