This is such an interesting story. It really gave me a good idea of the effects during and post war on soldiers and others involved. It described in great detail the issues the characters dealt with in all different situations and atmospheres. It was able to draw me in. I know that some people found it boring and unrealistic, while others found it interesting and action filled. It switches scenes all the time and jumped all over the place. It finally came together in the end. It worked out wonderfully by the end.
