She could get a 3 for acting I guess, but she loses any points she gains by being a horrible role model. I don't want my daughter striving to look like that when she's older. Skinny is ok if it's natural, athletic, I just can't get enough exercise skinny. Not the scrawny, malnutritioned, I can't hold my salad down kind of skinny. Please admit she has a problem.
