I am a service tech and I say they suck!! They have to much management running around in circles. To many liberals running the show. Everybody plays the blame game and nothing gets done. Whats important to them is crap nobody should be worried about, just managers stomping on other managers. Parts are never consistant for us to get and local management is completly worthless to talk to. The customer call center screws everything up!! the turnover rate must be terrible. Charter will never be a good company.
