Michelle Pfeiffer is a wonderful actress; probably my favorite. She has rarely given a bad performance (the notable exception being in Grease 2 ). There's always been something about her that just makes all of her characters so believable- maybe it's her dedication. She was good in Wolf along with Jack Nicholson. She also gave a wonderful performance in the inner city drama Dangerous Minds . I also enjoyed her performance in To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday . She had such chemistry with George Clooney in One Fine Day I just could not help but love that film. I thought she was also good in The Deep End Of The Ocean - she communicated her character's guilt over losing her son to the audience wonderfully, as well as her character's relief after his return. Another great performance in A Midsummer Night's Dream . She's proven that she's still got it with her performance in What Lies Beneath . Besides an amazing chemistry with Harrison Ford, I thought that she was so amazingly believable in that film, espescially toward the ending. I also liked her in I Am Sam - she was hilarious as the jittery lawyer who seems perfect in every way but we later find out that everything's not so perfect in her life. I thought that she was the perfect role for Catwoman even if the movie was less than stellar- she still did a fine acting job. In the final anylisis, Michelle Pfeiffer is a wonderful actor with an impressive resume whose career is still flourishing.
