I have had nothing but problems with warped Rotors on my 2001 Jeep GC. Jeep has been beyone arrogant and says it is a normal wear problem. Since when has a company made a vehicle that has to have brakes serviced every 20K miles? My last Chrysler product as their customer service has hit rock bottom since the Germans took over.
