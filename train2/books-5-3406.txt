IF YOU DON'T LIKE PEANUTS YOU MUST NOT BE AMERICAN... Seriously, Schulz's Peanuts is a piece of 20th century Americana. This, possibly the best collection of Peanuts strips ever, shows why. Every character is well known, well thought out, and 100% all American. A brilliant piece of work. (I suggest that people who don't like Peanuts give it another look. This is the kind of thing that brings generations of people together. In light of recent world events, it will probably make you smile.)
