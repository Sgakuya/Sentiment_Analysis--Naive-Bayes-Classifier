My personal favourite actor and has been for many years now. Admired his work since I saw him in The Bounty (remake of Mutiny on the Bounty) back in '84. Decided to delve a little deeper and seen pretty much all his films to his credit. (Some not so good). Always amazed to see how easily he can adapt to the paticular role. The Lambs still has to be the best to date. Over 60 now and still sexy!
