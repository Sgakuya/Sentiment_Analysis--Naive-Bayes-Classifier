OK my jaw is dropping at this moment. I like this girl, she has a quality in hollywood that is extremely rare. I have yet to see a role in which she has played that I think she could have done better. She is extremely versatile.Only thing I hold against her has nothing to do with her acting abilities, and that is marrying Tom Cruise.
