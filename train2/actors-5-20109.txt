Gillian Anderson is one of the most talented actresses out there. She does a wonderful job in her role as Dana Scully on The X-Files and performs just as well in her movies. If only she made more. There is something about her that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to not like her. I am looking forward to seeing The House of Mirth.I just hope that it comes to theatres where I live!!
