This woman shocked the industry when she beat out Meryl Streep (Postcards from the Edge) and Anjelica Houston (The Grifters) in 1990 to win Best Actress Oscar for 'Misery'.......and since then she has been consistently brilliant in character roles like 'Primary Colors'.....Has a menacing presence in everything. Just check out Bates in About Schmidt....
