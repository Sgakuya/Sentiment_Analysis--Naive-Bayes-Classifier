Our complaint is the same as many others. Their policy of holding your deposits(even those made directly from other amsouth accounts, which they say are immediate) and allowing debits to go through no problem. My husband tried to make a transfer online...it once again failed to go through. Their online banking is worthless if you have to go in to the bank to make sure it goes through and the overdraft fees are a crime...in my husband's business account, we had suffered some overdrafts while they were holding checks, they made sure they charged us their fees before they cleared the checks, yes, that's right, racking up another overdraft fee and on went that process for several transactions. By the way, neither of our accounts was ever really negative, just unavailable! They were no help at the bank when i went in, i know personally they could care less, but we have huge medical bills from my daughter's illness...you would think they would have a collective heart...i asked if we could pay the fees back over time so that we could pay our rent and other necessary bills and the answer was..."We've already taken the money out of your account." I wonder is it legal for them to take money out of my account like that without my authorization?
