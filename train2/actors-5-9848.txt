Reese Witherspoon IS THE BEST ACTRESS IN THE WHOLE WORLD!!! If I could rate her myself or give her a score it would be beyond what I could count too! You can't judge her unless you really know her, and nobody can say she is bad or terrible, you would have had to meet her or seen every single one of her movies!! I mean come on! You gotta love her! She is a great actress and she really tries hard! She has a new baby gurl now named Ava Elizabeth and has alot to do, so dont put her down if you dont know her! That makes me so mad! I hate it when people diss on her! UGh! Well I LOVE REESE! Goodluck to her! Buh bye- Lauren Elizbeth
