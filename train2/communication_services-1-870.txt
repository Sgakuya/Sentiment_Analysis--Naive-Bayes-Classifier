i will NEVER sign with telus again!! i work in retail and i'm well aware of what customer service is all about....telus have no idea!!! i'm sure they'll lose many customers over the fact that they have no replacement phones for poor quality issues. my family has been with rogers for 7 yrs now and the slightest problem with recepiton means we get a free new phone - no gliches! i can't cancel my account without it being extremely costly, i'll get no rebate to a new plan if i end my current plan early, they won't replace my phone or even take it in for repair! telus just lost my business for good!!!
