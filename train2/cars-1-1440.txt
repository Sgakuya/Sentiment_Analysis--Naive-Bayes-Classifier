Perhaps the ugliest car on the road since the AMC Pacer. The first time I saw an Echo I thought it was some kind of joke - but what are the chances that the designers at Toyota have a sense of humor? There are plenty of reliable cars on the road. Most of them aren't hideously ugly. why anyone would voluntarily choose to drive an Echo is completely beyond me. Maybe Toyota should stick to what they do best: boring but inoffensive.
