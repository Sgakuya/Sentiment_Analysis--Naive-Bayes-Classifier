although i disapprove of romance interfearing with history, Clavell introduced the love story in Shogun as a part of Japanese customs and way of life. I re-read this book twice and i still discover hidden meanings. currently writting a paper over Shogun and its factual base in japanese history. Any information would be appreciated relating to how Shogun is factual in Japanese history. please email any insights. Lowiegurl@excite.com
