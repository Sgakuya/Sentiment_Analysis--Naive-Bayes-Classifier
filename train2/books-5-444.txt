One of my favorite childhood books. A story about the unusual friendship btween a pig named Wilbur and a spider names Charlotte. Wilbur is pretty down because he was sold to farm and taken away from his human friend Fern. Charlotte befreinds Wilbur and starts getting the attention of others by writing nice things about him in her spider web.such as terrificthis gets Wilbur a lot of attention. I like this book because it is about friendship and pulling together for one another.
