My heart and mind contain a great amount of empathy for this talented actor/singer. While having surgery for her throat they botched it and now she will never sing like she used to. She sued and was successful with her lawsuit. Her work has entertained countless children, including myself as a child. I am now 18 and plan on letting my children watch her wholesome movie roles in Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, and The Princess Diaries. What a gift to show business!
