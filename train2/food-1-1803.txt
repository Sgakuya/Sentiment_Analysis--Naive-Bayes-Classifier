Pixy Stix are a terrible, too sour tasting candy. They come in those little straws, and you have to chug in down your throat and empty it out. This is like eating a bag of sugar. It reall is, this candy is just sugar dyed a different color, and then they add this strange sour flavor, that makes it taste like a dried fruit.
