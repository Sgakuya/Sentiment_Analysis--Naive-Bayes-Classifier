The university has MANY problems: professors with foreign accents, a false worship of their b-ball team, a history of racism, the naming of Rupp Arena after a racist, racist boosters that told Rex Chapman to quit dating black girls, and the abuse I found at www.angelfire.com/ky/pccsucks This university is a real waste of tax dollars and should definitely be investigated.
