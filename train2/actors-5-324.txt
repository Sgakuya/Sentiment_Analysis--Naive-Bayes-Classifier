I have always thought that Gregory Peck was a great actor even when I was very small. My brother and I used to drive our parents nuts watching 'Macennas Gold' all of the time and I still love it now, it's a great action movie. The Guns of Naverone was another great success, so successsful that they had to make a sequal. Robert Mitchum pitted against Gregory would make a fantastic film any day of the week, but with such an interesting screenplay that Robert Di Nero felt that he wanted to do remake of it! And what about The Big Country...the film with the famous soundtrack? Co-starring Charleton Heston it was truely a landmark film that perhaps paved the way to many of the epic stories that we see on film today and which coincidentally Gregory helped produce. He has brought me many hours of viewing pleasure and I wish him well for the future. Just remember old turkey buzzard. That old turkey buzzard..
