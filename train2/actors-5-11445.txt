It's too bad she's taken a step back from acting to hang with her billionaire husband and kids because she is a very sexy actress. It isnt just her smile that is crooked it's her whole face that is sort of broken up but it's beautiful. And her legs are to die for. Her interracial sex scene with Laurence Fishbourne in Bad Company was incredible.
