One of my favorite Our Gang shorts featuring Matthew Beard (Stymie) was The Pooch... in which he (along with Pete the Dog and a three-year-old Spanky) wander around town begging for food; when he finally obtains an artichoke, he pulls down all the leaves, views the heart, and throws the unraveled artichoke as far as he can throw it, saying, It might choke Artie, but it ain't gonna choke Stymie.... which I believe to be one of the funniest lines ever said in the entire Our Gang series. He excelled at the more serious scenes, as well, and he was able to cry on cue, making the viewers want to take the little boy into their arms and console him (Jackie Cooper was good at that, too!) I also got a kick out of the way Stymie would break out into a sweet little grin after saying something precocious. His character added a lot to Our Gang.
