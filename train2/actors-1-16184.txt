Gosh, a One star raing is too good in my opinion. MB is a terrible actor that talks in monotones, mumbles, whispers and plays the same emotions in Every scene. His day is over. Time for someone new to take over. Someone that's not constanly looking offscreen at the cue cards!! And someone I don't have to turn on the closed captioning to understand what's being said! Someone professional that has a normal sized ego and is not afraid of sharing the limelight.
