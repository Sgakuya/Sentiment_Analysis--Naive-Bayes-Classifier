Vivien Leigh is one of the most talented and beautiful actresses of all time. In 'Gone With The Wind' she was absolutely stunning in beauty and unforgettable in portrayal. She has, for all time, completely captured the role, as hers alone. But her superb acting does not end with her oscar winning roles. She is equally captivating, in all her roles. I especially loved her in 'That Hamilton Woman'. She was the perfect Lady Hamilton.
