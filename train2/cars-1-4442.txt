Simply put, this van bites. Never have I had to deal with a major mfr. that was so terrible! Telling me that because I was slightly over the ext. warranty period on the head gasket issue, so I longer qualified for reimbursement. A problem I feel is not a warranty issue but a major defect in the vehicle. Instead of accepting responsibility and recalling the van, they do this warranty thing which only shows more that they have a major goof, NOT that they are being customer-service oriented. Thank God for my Toyota Echo. To think their new vehicle is called a Focus! Ha! FOCUS ON THIS FORD!
