He's shown himself as a hot young talent, and I find his performances believable. He's best in his bad boy/stoner roles, ( The Faculty, Virgin Suicides ) but I still find him enjoyable in cute kid roles. He's also quite handsome, moreso than some of the other young actors out there. Mysterious eyes... :)
