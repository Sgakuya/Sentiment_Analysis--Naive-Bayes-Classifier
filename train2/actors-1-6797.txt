Any interest I had in this washed up, conceited phoney was gone the moment he made a disgusting, disrespectful remark about former President Reagan. I believe it was a lame joke aimed at Mr. Reagans Alzheimer's that brought him down to a total zero in my eyes. What a pig this Clooney is! And who wants his political opinion anyway? He isn't anybody to give a damn about. I wouldn't spend a red cent on anything Clooney puts out there. He's not that good of an actor anyway. Maybe you can find a job at McDonald's, George?
