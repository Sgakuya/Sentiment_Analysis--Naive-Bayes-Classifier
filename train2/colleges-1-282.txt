I agree with Sheba. University of Hooked on Phonics (Phoenix) is a complete joke. Its used by people who just want to pay money and get a degree. I took one class in the IT program, and just like Sheba said, the strong carry the week. One of my team members decided to go on vacation in Canada during our class and provided no input for our group project. He still got a passing grade. (an A as I recall.) I would FIRE someone (I mean eliminate their possition) for pulling something like this. Please do not let my attempts at humor cloud the issue - this school is a waste of your money. If you want quality, try Arizona State, Indiana Univ. or even www.ed-x.com to find a program. You'll be glad you did. I chose to apply to the distance ed MBA programs at IU and AZ State.
