I honestly find Hilary Swank's portrayal of Brendon Teena in the film 'Boys Don't Cry', as simply one of most true-to-life analyses of hardships in an ofetn self-centred world. Hilary Swank pulls of probably the most courageous performances I have seen in film, and for that she ought to be commended and realised as a brilliant actress worthy of high appraisal. Furthermore, she is beautiful, far more, in fact, than any other actress of which I am aware. She really has gor raw talent, and combined with her frightfully stunning looks, she will continue to amaze audiences around the world for many, many years to come.
