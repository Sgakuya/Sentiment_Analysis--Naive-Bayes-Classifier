I presently have an older one of these (93) its the biggest hound dog I've ever owned. I found out I'm NOT a Van person. This one is really bad though. It was fine for a short time then things started going wrong. BIG waste of money. Coulda had a Chevy Truck. I'll have one soon, this one's on the way out.
