The best way to describe Russell Crowe is YUMMY. As for his acting, I think he is the most fantastic actor I have ever seen in my thirtysomething years. The only problem is that he is too good. I think one of his greatest preformances was in The Insider - he became that man. It is riveting watching his work. I believe as an actor he can do no wrong and that he could teach everyone in his profession a thing or two. (Though, he should probably stay away from comedy.) As for his personal life, I'd rather that remained private. He doesn't seem to live an admirable life and has made some bad choices. Learn a lesson from Andy Garcia, Russel, and refrain from divulging personal information about yourself to your loving public. Final Thought - He is like a Monet painting mixed among the drawings of children. He is fantastic and stands out from all the others.
