His OPINION at the Oscar's was not only fact-less and ridiculous it was wholly inappropriate when, for better or worse, men and women, who happen to be citizen's of the United States, are in harm's way fighting for freedom, democracy and the very liberties that Mr. Moore so flaunted on international television. He has the right to his opinion but to take advantage of the situation and spew such anti-american hatred on television showed a huge amount of tact-less lunacy.
