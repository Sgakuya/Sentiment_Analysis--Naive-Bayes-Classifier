The single mooost over-rated performer in Hollywood, bar none. That she is pretty is not in doubt; her acting skills are mediocre at best; her singing skills are paltry. Worst of all, she is just plain boring. I fail to see what the industry buzz over her is all about. I guess there is no accownting for taste... And please, get a real name. :=8P
