Golden Grahams cereals are so unhealthy for you, that it's not even funny. They take the wheat flake, and dip it into candied honey, and then they dip it into brown sugar, and then in another kind of candied honey that has over 100 acids in it that will make you constipated. It tastes just as bad as it sounds.
