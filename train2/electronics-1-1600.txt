I have a Sony Wega 36 inch that I parched several years ago for big bucks, $2300.00 in less then a year it stopped working displaying only a blinking red standby light. Sony customer support was a long lesson on being put on hold and ultimately no help at all. I paid a service tech 150.00 to look at it and he wanted $500.00 to try to fix it with no guarantees. The set started working on its own. twice since then it has crapped out only to eventually begin working on its own again several days later. A $2300.00 TV should work dependably long then 2 or 3 years and any company charging that kind of money for a TV should stand behind it and not stone wall their customers. Sony is definitely aware of this problem but instead chooses to ignore it and frustrate their loyal customers. WEGAs affected should be recalled and fixed, refunded or replaced if Sony wants to continue to stand for quality and dependability. My WEGA is currently blinking standby and I have no idea when it might work again, it is a 300lb TV in the living room and cannot be easily moved with two people so I am once again stuck with no repair person or company who can tell me what is wrong or guarantee a fix. I will not buy any Sony product or recommend any Sony product in the future until Sony gets behind this problem
