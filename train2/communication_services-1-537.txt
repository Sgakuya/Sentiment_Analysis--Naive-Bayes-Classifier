Nextel has three major problems. The first is terrible customer service. They don't care about you or how much time you spend waiting and being transferred around. Second, Motorola is producing some junk phones. I've had nothing but trouble from both my i1000 and my i90c. My i1000 would lose connection between the battery and phone. The i90 has a very weak connection between the phone and the charger. Nextel will do nothing to fix either of these problems. Third, Nextels rate plans are the highest around. Nextels only advantage is the direct connect, but the bad outweighs the good. I'm switching as soon as number portability happens.
