Another work in the classic Vonnegut style. He creates a shadow world mirrored by his experience in World War II. How can men live when their life is not worth living? Well Vonnegut does not pretend to know but his characters are driven to self preservation even through the horrors of war. If you are in a good mood, read something else. If, however, life has you by the balls read this and find others who feel he same way.
