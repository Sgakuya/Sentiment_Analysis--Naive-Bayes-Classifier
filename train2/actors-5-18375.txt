I fully agree with Wiggum here, Coppola is a wonderful director. Rumble Fish alone would assure him five stars from me. In addition to the films that Wiggum mentioned I would also like to give props to The Conversation an early Coppola film starring the great Gene Hackman. I recently saw Coppola on Inside the Actors Studio and he was great, the more insight I have to his films the more I respect his work.
