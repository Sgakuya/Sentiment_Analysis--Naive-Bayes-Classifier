She will be one to watch Secretary--brilliant. She was wonderful in Donnie Darko (and very funny!) and Casa De Los Babys. So far everything I've seen her in, I've liked. (Even her brief roles in Adaptation and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind). May be docked a star later down the road depending on her movie choices.
