Since her death in 1962, she has become one of several cartoon-like American icons. But, never doubt it; Norma Jean could act and the character she played best was Marilyn Monroe. The blonde bombshell routine had already been well established (Harlow, Mae West, etc.) when she changed her name, her nose, and her hair color. Still, she managed to take this hackneyed role and put her own spin on it, and, in the process, gave it more depth and character making it uniquely her own. This was no dumb blonde accident; she knew exactly what she was doing. Her movie roles were predictable, but always very well done. Sadly, she was more often than not relegated to light comedy blonde bimbo parts rather than anything that might have tapped into a deeper talent that we can, nevertheless, still sense in her work. This may have been because her ability was always upstaged and hidden by her overt sex appeal or, perhaps, simply ignored in favor of it. Sex, after all, is the proven big seller and nowhere has it been a more lucrative commodity than Hollywood. This exploitive attitude toward her and toward herself and maybe even a lack of confidence on some level crippled any chances she may have had to be taken completely seriously in her day. Had she lived and been able to shake the sex goddess thing - which would have obviously been easier to do as time went by - perhaps she would have moved into the kind of roles that would have changed the public perception of her. But, much like the circumstances of her death, whether or not this could have actually happened will remain forever part of the Monroe mystique.
