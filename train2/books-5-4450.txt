I recently re-read this and absolutely fell in love with it again. You root for the heroine so much, wishing she'd finally reach some happiness. Vividly told with descriptions that immerse you in the strict Victorian era, its a wonderfully moving, gothic romance of the time but not for the cynical at heart. Its desperately romantic in a way sure to turn some off.
