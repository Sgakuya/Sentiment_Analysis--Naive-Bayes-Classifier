As great as Clint Eastwood is as an actor, he is quite possibly an even better movie director. Efficient with his time and effort, Clint Eastwood has been known to wrap up filming ahead of schedule. Eastwood has a no-nonsense approach to filmmaking, as well, as he is able to corral actors who have difficult personalities to smoothly perform altogether. Yet, his greatest contribution might be his intricate attention to detail- and at the same time present a magnificent story for moviegoers to follow. In short, Eastwood is one of THE quintessential rennaisance men of motion pictures.
