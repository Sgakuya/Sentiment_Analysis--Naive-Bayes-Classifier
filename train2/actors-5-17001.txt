Eden Riegel has got to be the most talented (and not to mention beautiful) actress on daytime! She has the most expressive eyes. Sometimes she doesn't even need to speak to express how her character (Bianca) is feeling. Just one look at her face, and you know... You can just feel it! Simply put, she's amazing.
