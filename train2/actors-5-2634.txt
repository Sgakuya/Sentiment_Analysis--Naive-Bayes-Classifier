One of my favorite roles (and least mentioned) of Edward's is the role of Worm in Rounders. It is a fantastic movie and Edward provides more depth to not only his character, but Matt Damon's as well. Edward carried that movie and I can't wait to see his new projects. One of my goals in life is to work with the fabulously talented Edward Norton.
