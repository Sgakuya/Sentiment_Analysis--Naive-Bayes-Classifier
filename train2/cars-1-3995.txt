Are you kidding me? This Buick has all the guts and snob appeal of a Geo. The mystique and allure of the Buick brand along with many other of the domestics died a long time ago. This is a nothing more than a cheap ploy to try and lure younger buyers into Buick showrooms. A Buick SUV? I figure the typical Buick owner would only need a car to get him or her to the doctor or to buy groceries!!! Buick will never be as cool or hip as Acura or BMW. If you want a real luxury SUV and not a snoozer, look somewhere else!
