Christine Ricci should walk away on this list in the top 10, because she has risen to the top, and stayed there, acting in these movies, in which she never plays an annoying chracter, and really concentrates on her roles so well. I loved her in The Addams Family, she was so funny as Wednesday. She's like the Mindy Cohn of the 90s.
