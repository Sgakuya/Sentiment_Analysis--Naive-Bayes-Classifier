Stephen Nichols is the best Actor that I've ever seen. Not only on Daytime, but nightime, and on stage. Why the Daytime shows are simply using him to prop up a silly kid story I don't know? I only watch A show to see him, and when he leaves GH I will be gone. I only hope that some writer will give him a story that is worth his skill.
