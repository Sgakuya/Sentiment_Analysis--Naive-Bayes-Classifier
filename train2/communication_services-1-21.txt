I, like many thought the My line complete was a great deal. 49.95 per mo. for UNLIMITED Long distance. Not one time did they define unlimited as being anything other than unlimited. Yet suddenly I receive notification from them that I am exceeding industry standards What standards? No where in thier information did it mention exactly what those standards are. So I guess that Unlimited to them is whatever they feel like allowing. The customer service (If you can ever get through) is just as bad. (They must contract out to India because these are the only people I have ever been able to get ahold of) Save your money, go somewhere else where they actually come across with what they advertise.
