Beautiful and talented woman, and it's sad she struggled with mental illness. If she were alive today, there are medications that could have helped her function better. Yes, she was a wonderful Scarlett, but she was absolutely heartbreaking in A Streetcar Named Desire. It's almost painful to watch her in that movie.
