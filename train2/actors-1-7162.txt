Affleck comes off like a total shmuck in his movies and I don't understand why girls think he is so attractive. His acting is just as bad now as it was when he was doing Kevin Smith movies and his real life personality is even dopier than the characters he plays. I've got to say though that him and J Lo will make the ultimate no talent, high paycheck couple in the history of movies.
