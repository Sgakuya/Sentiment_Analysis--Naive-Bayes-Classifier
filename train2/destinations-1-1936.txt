1. Americans are full of themselves. Take Grim for example, the people doesnt give a damn on what others think, just like to talk in their own way doesnt matter if them might hurt others. 2. No doubt America have Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and UN building at their country, they they like to interfer with others business and wanna take control of the whole world. 3. Americans like to mock at others. Take South Park the movie for example, I think Americans are very vulgar themselves, SO STOP MAKING FUN OF OTHER COUNTRIES.
