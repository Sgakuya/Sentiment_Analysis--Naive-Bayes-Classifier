After jumping off the screen in Desperado, Salma Hayek has played every type role imaginable in Hollywood, and played them all well. A GREAT actress, no question about it. Frida, for years her own special project, was deserving of much more box-office than it got. It won Oscars and Salma was incredible in it. If you don't care for her skill or her choice of roles, you still have to give her credit. She makes all her roles believable. And for those of you who had to play the race card, your opinions mean nill to those of us with more in mind than sex!
