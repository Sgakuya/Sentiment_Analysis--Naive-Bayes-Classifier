I am so in love with mark wahlberg....i am not even kidding. i mean i am not obsessed with him or anything cuz i dont have all these posters all over my walls but i do have pics of him. He was here where I live, in Trona, a while ago, shooting the movie Planet of the Apes and I didnt even get to see him. I was so crushed. Well, Mark if you ever do read this just know that I love you with all my heart and you are doing a great job in everything you do!!... :) love ya babe veronica
