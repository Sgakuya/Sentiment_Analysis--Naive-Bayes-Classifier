Norton's performance in American History X was phenominal. Until that point I had suspected he was the best of the crop to surface in the 90's. That role simply confirmed the suspicion. Unlike guys like Matt Damon, Edward Norton is going to be around for a long, long time. He was also amazing in the first film I caught him in, Primal Fear.
