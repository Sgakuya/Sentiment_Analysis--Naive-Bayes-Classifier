I personally never cared for most of her movies but they weren't made for guys and were from long before my time. I'd rate all of her movies very low since few, if any, featured things getting blown up. As a child star she is the benchmark. She was a box office smash and for such a short career, by Hollywood standards, she attained enormous success and popularity. Her bubbly attitude and curly hair made for a unique appearence. Not a strong actress but still rates as a 5 given the overall success and appeal.
