same complaints as most deciteful online balance. shows as positive when in fact they say your negitive. then charge you overdraft for example paid $1 for item, i only have $.50cents in my acct. they don't pay the $1, but they charge you $34 for trying to use your card. also they take the highest paid item first to be tallied at end of night and lower amt, so that the largest takes a bigger lump out of your balance and that way they can charge you for $34 overdraft for each smaller transaction for being negative. i am soo pissed that them i wanna everyone who works for them to rott in hell!!!!!!!! they also make UNAUTHORIZED transactions,,, then tell you that you have to prove that you didn't do it. how the fk can i prove i didn't do it, when i have nothing to prove it with?!!!!!??? fjdk;ajf dka; USBANK ROTT IN HELL!! i would NOT recommend this bank in fact i share with anyone who will listen that they are EVIL and any customer with them i tell them to move. they might not have screwed you yet, but they will just you wait. this wk i HAPPILY leaving usbank and taking my business elsewhere.....USBANK IS BAD, THE DEVIL, HORRIBLE, A NO STAR SERVICE, REPS ARE B#5CHES TOO, DO GO WITH THEM YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
