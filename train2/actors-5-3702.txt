I have seen him in Pirates of the Carribean and Lord of the Rings:Fellowship of the Ring He is a great actor. He is hot. I love his hair, his eyes, his smile. In Pirates of the Carribean he is great. Very good with a sword. (and a bow) He is the only reason I watched Lord of the Rings and now I am like hooked. Besides all that he is from England so he has that cute English accent.
