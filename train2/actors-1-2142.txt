This guy stinks so bad it's awful!!!! Like roslyn217 said Robin Williams is too manic and too schmaltzy for my tastes as well. He definitely should take some good strong sedatives during the course of the day. JJBurns84 is absolutely correct in his/her description of Robin Williams. As a daily mental excercise Mr. Williams should focus on one idea or one thought and try to stay focussed on that idea or thought for at least 5 minutes or more if possible. He should use more subtlety in his acting. Overall, he needs to get a better grip on his brain and start using it more, in more thinking roles.
