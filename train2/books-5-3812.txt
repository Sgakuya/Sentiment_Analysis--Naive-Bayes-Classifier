I just read Catch-22 again (the first time was in high school), and it was even better the second time around. This book is a modern classic. It somehow manages to pull off the unlikely combination of laugh-out-loud humor with bitter anti-war sentiment. I read Slaughterhouse Five right before Catch-22, and there are a lot of similarities between the two books. They both take place during World War 2, they both revolve around unlikely protagonists (the hapless Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse Five and the so-crazy-he's-sane Yossarian in Catch-22), and they both use sarcastic, slanted humor to highlight the horrors of war. Both books also convey a strange sense that events are completely beyond the control of the main characters; Yossarian and Billy Pilgrim are simply players on a stage controlled by mysterious forces they don't understand (the dark side of human nature?). That theme of war being a force too overwhelming for any one man to deal with also makes me think of the last scene in the movie Saving Private Ryan, where Tom Hanks is shooting pointlessly at that tank - a visual representation of the sense of helplessness pervading Catch-22. At first I agreed with other reviewers on this page that Heller could have shortened the book a little bit, but then I tried to think of which parts I wouldn't miss, and I couldn't come up with any. The book is entertaining and powerful from start to finish.
