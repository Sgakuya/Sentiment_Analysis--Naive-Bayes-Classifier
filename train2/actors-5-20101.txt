Gillian is an absolutely tremendous actress. She tackles the role of Dana Scully on a day to day basis and clearly evolves as an actress every x-files episode she shoots. She also takes steps forward with her film roles, namely Lily Bart in House of Mirth. She did a fantastic job in the Terence Davies directed Edith Wharton adaptation. Gillian is also an amazing person as she spend so much of her time working to raise money for many worth while causes such as NF and Aids awarenes... Not to mention she's absolutely gorgeous. What more can I say? She's a very well rounded human being, what's not to like?
