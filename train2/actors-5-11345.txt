Ashley Judd is a great actress. She is also beautiful, intelligent, and obviously has a heart of gold underneath her seemingly arrogant persona. Any young woman who would turn down hollywood to pursue the Youth Aids Foundation in Africa, and leave the comforts of home for weeks on end to live in and round the squander many of these people do is a class act. Read her travel journals and you'll read her heart. She desrves a 10 star rating.
