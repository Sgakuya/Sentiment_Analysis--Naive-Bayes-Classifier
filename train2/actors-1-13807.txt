I think J.R. exemplifies everything currently wrong with American culture. In the old days, you had actors who were either terribly good-looking and/or sexy or were tremendously talented and versatile. Now you have overpaid mediocrities, not particularly attractive or talented, who play the same trite, superficial cute role in every movie they're in and, depressing to say but true, they're never begging for work. In the old days, you had Cagney or Hepburn or Davis. Now you've got Julia Roberts. It's depressing to contemplate how banal movies in America have become.
