What a joke this fund is. I am a unfortunate owner of the FT World Fund, Latin America Fund, and Growth Fund. Over the last three years - one of the biggest boom period's in economic history, I would have been better off throwing darts at a list of stocks on the wall. Even more annoying is the cultish leader of Franklin Templeton with his shaved head and black turtlenecks - just show me the money, will you?
