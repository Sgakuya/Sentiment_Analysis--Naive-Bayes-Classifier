I've only seen Jason in 'St.Ives', 'The Patriot', 'Event Horizon' and 'Divorcing Jack', but I think he's an extremely talented actor, besides v. good-looking. He has screen presence. He managed to completely subvert 'The Patriot' both with his talent - there are scenes in which he acts with his eyes, without speaking, marvellously expressively - and with his sheer visual scrumptiousness in the swordfight scene... I'd love to see him do more swashbuckling roles, but preferably as the hero who doesn't end up sliced to bits in the final reel... He suits the breeches and long hair better than many modern actors.
