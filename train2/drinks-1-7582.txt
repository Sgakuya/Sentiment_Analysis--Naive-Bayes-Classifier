This is among the worst vodkas I've ever had. After three shots I had to puke, not from intoxication, but from terrible taste. Level is not smooth, not clean, not anything one desires from vodka. I rank it right with Gordon's. Regular Absolute, even 100 proof, goes down with ease. This stuff is like the $10 bottles priced at $30. Save yourself some misery and buy Grey Goose instead, or save some money and buy something cheaper.
