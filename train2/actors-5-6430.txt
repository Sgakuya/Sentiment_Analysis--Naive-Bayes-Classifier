I believe that Joshua Jackson deserves number 5 as his rating because he is such an excellent actor and I can't get enough of him. I'm not only saying this because he's one of the hottest guys to bless this earth but also because he seems really cool. One of my ambitions in life is to meet him and tell him how cool I think he is and how much I enjoy watching his movies (especially Mighty Ducks 1,2 and 3 when I was little and still now). I also can't wait till Dawson's Creek comes back on to telly, Katie Holmes is so lucky!
