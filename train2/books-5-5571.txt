Loved it! The best of the border trilogy. McCarthy's use of language (actually of two languages)is impressive. A true modern classic, both as a comong-of age novel and a Western. This is also one of the few authors who can convey the beauty and mystique of the horse-human relationship without drifting into sentimental gibberish (as in The Horse Whisperer ).
