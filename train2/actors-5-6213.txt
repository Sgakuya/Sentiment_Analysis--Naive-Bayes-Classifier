Michael Clarke Duncan is a wonderful actor, he caught my eye as Bear dancing on the table in those cheeta bikini briefs! He seems to be a lot like his TV characters and I am extremely attracted to that. He is lovable. I would love to get to know him as a person, he would be fun to hang with, not because he's an actor, but because of his personality. If you read this Michael, e-mail me!
