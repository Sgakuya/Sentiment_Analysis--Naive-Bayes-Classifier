Did any of the negative reviewers actually read this book? It is not racist. Right wing nuts hate this book because it makes fun of society and religon, not because it is racist. Society is absurd as is religon, which is why this book makes so many uncomfortable. Plus Twain is one of the funniest men who ever lived.
