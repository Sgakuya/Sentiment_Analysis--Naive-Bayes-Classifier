If anyone can make you want to join the realm of the undead it is Anne Rice. Despite wallowing in self-pity much of the time, the vampires in her story are magnetic, their world magical. One can imagine how lovely it would be to be immortal, to be so powerful and untouchable. Her loving portrayal of New Orleans made me a fan long before I had visited the city.
