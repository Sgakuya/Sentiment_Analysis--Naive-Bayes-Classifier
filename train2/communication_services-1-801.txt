Sprint digital coverage for the Bay Area/CA is terrible. Sprint offers free long distance and no roaming, but the trick is they charge you for analog service. If you look at the digital coverage, it's only along the cities. That means you switch to analog quite often and when you do you get charge 39-69 per min. In addition, when you switch from digital to analog, you get dropped calls. Sprint offers good phones, but bad service. Plus, the long distance is only free, if their pcs netork is located there.
