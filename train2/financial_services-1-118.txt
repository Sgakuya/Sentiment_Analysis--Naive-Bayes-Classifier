I bought a house with garage from Wells Fargo. Part of the problem is false advertisement. Only 25% of the garage was on the property the other 75% was on property that Wells Fargo did not own. I had paid for title insurance but that did not matter. The former owner of the property before the bank got it passed away. I wouldn't have bought the property if I knew the garage was on both lots. I was told I got all of it. Both lots in the deal. I also had to hire a lawyer just to get the property in my name. At closeing they had assurd me that both lots were on the title. But I guess that was just a lie to get my money. Now I found that code inforcement had sent a bill to Wells Fargo Bank. At closeing I was told that all the bills had been taken care of. I guess that was another lie. The city is talking about putting Wells Fargo Bank with a collection agency. However, I might end up with a lean against the house because Wells Fargo didn't take care of its property and didn't pay its bill. My experience with Wells Fargo Bank has been terrible. I have caught them in repeated lies, they say they are going to work to solve the problem and then do nothing, I can't get a loan on my house or resell it because of the problems, and whene I tried to talk to someone about it at the bank they hung up on me. They created the problem and now they just want to ignor it. That's the way I feel about Wells Fargo Bank.
