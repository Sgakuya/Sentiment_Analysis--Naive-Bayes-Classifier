One image remains in my mind when I think of Grapes of Wrath, and that is the last scene. It describes the humility, compassion suffering, sacrifice hope and survival of a period in American history that I had only come across in old headlines in old newspapers. If history is no object, as sometimes is the case, then the novel transcends history and speaks of humanity in an age of obstacles and how far the human spirit can go.
