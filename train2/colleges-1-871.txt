The school does not seem all bad, the people are okay...I can't necessarily swear by the education you'll get, it seems kind of 3rd rate, but whatever... My Question is this...Are the credits Transferrable? Can I use Phoenix to speed through my General Ed Requirements, or am I going to get burned in the long run when I find that I have to take a bunch of classes over again? Any personal experiences I can that can relate or offer insight?
