Jim Carrey has been my favorite actor in the whole world since i was in 4th grade, and Ace Ventura came out. Well now i'm a sophmore in high school and i get chills and giddy whenever i see a picture of him!! STILL!!! Jim Carrey is my idol, inspiration and i look up to him so much, anytime i make a wish, its to meet him, and it has been since i was 9 years old. I'm 16 now!!!! well i love him ,and if i dont get to meet him, then i know i loved him!!!!!!
