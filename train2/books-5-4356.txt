This novel is one of the best I have read. It's about a journery of a man named Oddyseus who has to get back home and encounters people who want to kill him like Scylla, Charybdis, Polythemus, Circe the goddess, and many others. This book you will never want to put down. A awesome adventure. Never a tiring moment from when Poor Oddyseus is chased by a tribe of cannibals, to being put on an island with hypnotists called The Lotus-Eaters, from looking at the seductive sirens to when he encounters the six headed angry goddess Scylla.
