Unfortunately, I fell for MCI WorldCom's come-on and their $75 check. They refused to honor their own check and telephoned me repeatedly about bill. After two threatening letters and five telephone calls and talking to nine different people, I settled the outrageous charges and went back to my original long-distance service. Spokespersons say their computers are to blame for the letters and calls, but their notes in files are never read before a human gets on the telephone line. MCI used to be good, but since WorldCom bought the company, it is horrible.
