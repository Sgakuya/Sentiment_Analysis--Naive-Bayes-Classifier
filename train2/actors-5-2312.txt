Not one actor on here can hold a candle to Mel Gibson. He is my favorite and is one of the most gifted and versatile performers out there..I do not think Pacino or Deniro for how gifted they are can do Shakespeare. He is also an amazing director. The Passion and Braveheart were masterpieces..Looks and charm onscreen and off only add to him
