Bank of America should change its slogan from "Higher Standards" to "don't talk to us, we won't help you anyway." I recently had my debit card cancelled (twice) with no notice within a two week period, neither due to my error. (One suspected fraud and the second due to "bank error" which I believe to be the work of a malicious employee who took offense to my phone call complaining about the first." I wrote a letter to Executive Relations and the representative was rude and condescending. No one ever apologized, and they refused to offer me any type of offsets for the inconvenience, hassle, or the time it took to change all my auto-bills, twice. Not to mention the embarrassment of having my card repeatedly denied through no fault of my own.
