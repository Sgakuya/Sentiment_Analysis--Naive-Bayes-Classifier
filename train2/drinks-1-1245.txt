This is by far the worst out of all the Millers ! I tried it once, got sick, tried it again to give it a second chance, didn't even make it to the 2nd beer. This stuff is definately for people with iron stomachs. I do not recommend it at all. If you love Miller, I would say go with Miller High Life.
