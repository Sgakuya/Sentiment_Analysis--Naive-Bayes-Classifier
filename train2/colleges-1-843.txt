Terrible! I am one week into an online course. The topics in the class description are not covered at all. The instructor simply wishes to post her personal accomplishments but definitely no lectures. Although my week was worthless, I am being charged for the week, application fee and materials fee. Please do NOT make my foolish mistake. When I called about the misrepresentation of my course, the enrollment advisor CONFIRMED there is no instructor accountability. Basically once the class is sold to you their hands are tied!
