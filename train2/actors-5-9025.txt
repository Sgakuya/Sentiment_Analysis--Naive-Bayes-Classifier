Meryl gets my respect first off as a lot of Actresses today feel that their value and worth in the industry comes from taking your clothes off to gain some recognition, particularly from the Oscars. If you look at the awards Meryl has won and how long shes been around shes never had to take her clothes off for any of them or lie about her age like most actors today and shes gained a lot of respect from her peers over the years for caring about her work and valuing herself.
