Stop it ALREADY! I am tired of,'smoothing skirts','making tea','tugging braids','folding arms under breasts','lace','tucking things into folds of cloth for safe keeping','pouting','pursing','wide eyed stares','buttoning and un-buttoning dresses','heavy woolen skirts','thick silk','a cast of MILLIONS - that I have NO idea why they all have names'and 'stereotypical races'... END IT ALREADY! Stop padding the story or Flogging a Dead Horse... This book series is a total sell out.
