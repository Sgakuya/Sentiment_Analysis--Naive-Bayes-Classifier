I agree 100% with all of you, except for that A person. I'd like to add that since I discovered Jeremy and having been witness to his superb acting and first rate movies, I now find it difficult to settle for lesser quality actors and movies. That includes many of the big blockbuster hits that pale in comparison. He has become the benchmark for which all other actors should aspire to. And God is he gorgeous!!
