People can say whatever they want to regarding the content of the book, but I will say that it was greatly entertaining. How much of what is written in this book is true is debatable...although most of it is probably theological conspiracy theories. However, the book makes you reconsider what you may have learned about religion and history. Whether or not you feel strengthened in your faith after reading this book or begin to doubt what history has taught us, I feel that Dan Brown has done an excellent job of writing an entertaining novel as well as challenging his readers beliefs.
