This is a story I have enjoyed my whole life. I remember reading this interesting, well-crafted tale with my best friend Shelli, between the ages of 9 and 11. I have read this wonderful story to all seven of my children. It is a kind, compassionate tale that inspires imagination and encourages independence.
