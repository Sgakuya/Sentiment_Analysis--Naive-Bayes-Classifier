Took my whole family with kids ranging from 6 to 16. I was warned that if I was expecting Disney Cleanliness, that I was in for a big surprise. Trash everywhere, spilt drinks, gum, filthy bathrooms, rotted wood, and the list goes on. The only good part were the rides themselves. Even they were being run by a bunch of kids that looked like they could give a rats !@#$% as to whether anyone had a good time or not. Go for the rides if you are a thrill seeker. However, don't expect much anything else.
