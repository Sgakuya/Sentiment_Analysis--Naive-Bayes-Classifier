Have you ever felt like climbing Everest? Has the desire to swim across the Atlantic woken you from pleasant dreams and left you quaking in bed? All those with short attention spans and weak bladders, step aside. This book is not for you. Joyce has written a tribute to Homer and followes the adventures of one man through a day instead of the years of wanders endowed by the true Ulysses. It is filled with sex, flatulence, and human thought, all of which had the effect of having the book banned in this country. Read it before it becomes illegal again.
