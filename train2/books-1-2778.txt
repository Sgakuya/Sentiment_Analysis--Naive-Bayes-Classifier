I suffer from depression. This book offers no help at all. This book is only created for Christians and no one else. That's what I hate. The fact that the author doesn't really want to help people with depression, but that he wants to further permeate his religious propoganda. Now I know a lot of Christians don't like athiests or agnostics. I'm a peaceful person and I don't mind people praying. I just don't want it enforced on me and that's what this book does rather than do what the title says.
