This was truly the most powerful book I have ever read and the only one that has ever brought me close to tears. I'm ashamed that it has taken me, a 31 year old Jewish man, so long to read it. Through raw emotion, the atrocities that Wiesel went through are painted with terrifying detail. What everyone must remember is that his is just one of millions of similar stories. Unlike most of the others, he survived and had the courage to bare his soul.
