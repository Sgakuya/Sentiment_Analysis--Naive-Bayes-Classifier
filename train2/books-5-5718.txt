Forget the freaking Psycho shower scene. One of the creepiest scenes ever (more so in this book than in the movie) is the infamous/famous elevator scene somewhere in the middle. Well, I know that Thomas Harris has a talent for giving me a few more pieces of info than necessary for my health, but it's fantastically written and has an intriguing plot. Hannibal Lecter is one of the most unforgettable characters in all literature. Jame Gumb/Buffalo Bill/Billy Rupin was one of the most gruesome, and yet the noe part of the book that makes you want to keep reading. It's been chased after by censors time and time and time again, but no one can prtotect me or anyone else from this great book. Take care, everyone!
