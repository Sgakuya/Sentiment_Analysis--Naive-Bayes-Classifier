An absurdist comic masterpiece, with a droll, wry and ironic laugh on every page. A very imaginative take on the mundane and pointless nature of the bureaucracies of modern life. A most prescient examination of insecurity, regret, paranoia and guilt. A surreal picture of a world gone mad and not caring at all about it. A renouncement of The System and its effect on the life of the Average Person. A questioning of the essential validity of laws and authority. The Self is under constant attack in this one, and the whittling away of that entity makes this a conceptual version of Candide.
