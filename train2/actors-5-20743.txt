Shes great actress and so down to earth.I've seen her and i have her autograph. Shes the kind of person you'll be friends with. Its great to see a new lucille ball and carol burnett and by that i mean an actress who can be ditzy but then turn around and be serious. This november go see Looney tunes back in actionShes great and shes my inspiration in acting.
