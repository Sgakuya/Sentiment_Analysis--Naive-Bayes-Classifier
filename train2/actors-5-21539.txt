Well, this is the easiest decision that I have made all day. Who doesn't like Rhoda? Anyway, 4 Emmy awards and 8 nods in a row for playing one of the most realistic and best written characters over almost nine years in the 70s is very special. The woman can make you think, cry, be inspired, and, especially, laugh. What a marvel to behold.
