There is no denying, under any circumstances that De niro is a fantastic actor. Devoted to his art, talented, he does far more than he is ever given credit for. The diversity of roles, even in characters who sem at first the same (Jimmy Conway/ Sam Rothstein) they are eventually revealed inn all their complexities by this master craftsman. Plus he's been doing it for ages and even in pooror films - Meet The Parents - he still pulls off a performance every other actor would be jealous of.
