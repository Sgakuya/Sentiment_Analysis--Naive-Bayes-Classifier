Jude Law is very much my celebrity crush now. I don't get all starry-eyed with a famous guy that often, but I have made a serious exception for my Jude. Not only is he so increadibly handsome, he is also a very, very notable actor. He was fabulous in A.I.(which was a breathtaking movie)and The Talented Mr.Ripley, not to mention his more obscure stuff like Music From Another Room and I Love You, I Love You Not. I really want to marry this man and have his children. (Yeah, I know, he's already married with children, but I can dream.)
