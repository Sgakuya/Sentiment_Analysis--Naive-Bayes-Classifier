So talented and versatile. He can play anyone and make it believable. All the more impressive because he is neither handsome, nor does he look like an everyday everyman type character. I much prefer the old time stars to the present cast of mostly vacuous and banal wannabes but Dustin Hoffman is as good an actor ever. The airport scene in Rain Man is one of the best sequences for an actor in the history of Hollywood. This guy should be at the top of the list not the highly overrated and strained overactor Tom Hanks.
