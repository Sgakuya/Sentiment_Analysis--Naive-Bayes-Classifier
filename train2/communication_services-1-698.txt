Cingular...what can I say? NOTHING! Rotten coverage. Static, in and out, horrendous. I dont work for any other company-like verizon, etc. This is from my experience. I changed 3 diff. phones to make sure it was the service not the phones that were giving me the coverage. At least 1/2 the time, network not available -not always in the same location either, no service, or complete static. This was the absolute worst expeience ever! I complained for 6 months and finally got released from my contract without a $150 termination fee (imagine getting cable 12 the time and still having to pay for a full bill!?!) only if I returned my $200 phone to them! I would rather talk on string cans than ever give this rotten evil empire another dime. Their customer service line is horrible as well-long wait times, hangups and over 25 minutes to get a supervisor! GO ELSEWHERE-SHOW THEM CUSTOMER SERVICE STILL COUNTS-NOT JUST MINUTES. What good are minutes anyways if ya can't use them!
