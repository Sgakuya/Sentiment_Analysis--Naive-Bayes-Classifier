He's such a great role model and inspiration. He's one of the coolest actors to ever set foot on a stage. He deserves everything he has so far, and a lot more. He's played everything. I seriously hope he never wears out or anything. Loved him in The Usual Suspects (which was an excelent movie partly because of him, by the way). He's extraordinary in everything he does. He can take a simple, vague role, and turn it into something marvelous.
