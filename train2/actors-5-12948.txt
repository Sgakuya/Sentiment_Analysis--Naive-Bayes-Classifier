LeeLee Sobieski is a very good actress, and very attractive. She has been often refered to as a young Helen Hunt. These two actresses would be perect for roles that call for sisters. Not only is LeeLee beautiful, she also has a very sexy and seductive voice. The first time I saw her, she starred in a Tv Movie called Joan of Arc. A fine actress with a great future in Hollywood.
