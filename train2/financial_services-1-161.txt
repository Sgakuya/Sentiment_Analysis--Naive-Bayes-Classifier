This applies to the Citizens Bank Mortgage division. In short they are quite possible the worse mortgage company I ve ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I ve been trying to close on a condo with Citizens for over a month now. Both realtors and lawyers for both sides are pissed because of the way Citizens is handling this. For instance, they have lost most faxes sent to them. When they have gotten them they keep saying that they need this initial, this line is illegible, etc.. Then they deny that they ever got a response from anyone. My loan officer generally calls me back after about 2 calls to her. I told them the amount I was putting down and they got the amount incorrect. On the closing day the papers were incorrect. Then they keep coming up with new papers they need to look at etc Delay after delay. I ve had 4 closing dates. Everyone passed because of an issue with this bank. DO NOT USE THEM AS A MORTGAGE COMPANY!
