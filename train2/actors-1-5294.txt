Remember that PSA that went this is your brain....this is your brain on drugs? He doesn't. I can overlook a problem once or twice but after that, you become a dangerous rolemodel and I gotta boot ya. I have kids and I don't want them to think that you can use drugs and be a success, because that only happens in Hollywood.
