Kate is one of the best new actresses I've seen in a long time. She's gorgeous and has tons of charisma and chemistry. She can play a guy and a girl perfectly, plus, she looks awesome walking around the set in her underwear! :) She seems very intelligent and grounded, and I think she'll go far if given the chance.
