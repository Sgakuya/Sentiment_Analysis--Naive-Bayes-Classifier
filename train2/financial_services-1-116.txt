My mother has an auto loan account with Wells Fargo. They have threatened her repeatedly about not having insurance. She has had insurance, but they won't bother to check any of the faxes that she and the insuance company has faxed to confirm this. They are in the process of trying to take the car. We are going to have to get attorney's involved. Please don't get caught up with tham. They are not worth it. I guess they are trying to give her an early Christmas present.
