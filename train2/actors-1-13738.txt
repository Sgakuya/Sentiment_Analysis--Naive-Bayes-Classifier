So annoying, she single-handedly made it almost impossible for me to watch Dawson's Creek. Actually, maybe I should give her five stars for preventing me from wasting any more time on that steadily-declining show. Anyway, I hope Michelle Williams fades away, and soon. There are much more talented, better-looking young actresses waiting in the wings.
