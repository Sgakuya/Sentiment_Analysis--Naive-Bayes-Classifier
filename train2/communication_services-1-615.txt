I am VERY UPSET. To all viewers even thinking about signing up with Pac Bell please do not. As you all know Pac Bell is merging with cingular. It's there fault for the back log, but yet I have a 500 dollar phone bill to pay for. I had called to activate my mobile to mobile and they said it was okay they could do it, but then i found out that it won't come into effect until next month. So now I'm stuck with another gigantic phone bill to pay!!! Furthermore, the customer service CARE associate (good choice of name) was extremely rude to me and was not of any help. DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM. I'M WAITING FOR MY CONTRACT TO END AND MOVING TO ANOTHER CARRIER!!!!
