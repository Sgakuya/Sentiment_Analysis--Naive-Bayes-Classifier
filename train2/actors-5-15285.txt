Perhaps the best young actress right now. She has played a number of roles and has a wide range of talents. She does not depend on cuteness, just sheer ability. She has been outsanding in 13; The Missing; Little Secrets. etc.etc. She can do comedy, tradedy- anything. One of the few child stars for whom one can predict a successful adult career as well. She should have a long and highly successful career.
