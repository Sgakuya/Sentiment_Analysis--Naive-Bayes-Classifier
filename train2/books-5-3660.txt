I would have liked to have read this before 1984 actually happened. But even after-the-fact it's still a fascinating creation. And after reading it you get all the references everyone makes to Big Brother (even though many who make such referenes have never actually read this book and just like to throw cliched catch phrases around that make them sound significant).
