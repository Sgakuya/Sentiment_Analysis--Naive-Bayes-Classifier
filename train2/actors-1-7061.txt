He is nothing new and I can't possibly fathom why anybody would give him four stars. With so many other great actors out there why would someone think he was something special. Which one of his performance has been underrated, Shanghai Noon, Behind Enemy Lines? I don't consider those roles to be very demanding. For whoever thinks he is great, please stay away from Kevin Spacey, Nicolas Cage, Edward Norton, and Dusin Hoffman, you might die from shock at how great they are. Stick with Keanu Reeves and Jason Biggs so you aren't overwhelmed.
