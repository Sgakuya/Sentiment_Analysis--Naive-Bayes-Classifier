This town is sooooo boring! There's no diversity whatsoever and it basically sucks! The ONLY thing Ann Arbor has going for it is the University. Hurry up and graduate in 4 years and get out while you can! Not much to do for minorities, not much to do for anybody period! Michigan is pretty corny overall if you ask me. Chicago is the best city to live in if you want to move to the midwest. Do NOT move to Ann Arbor because it sucks!
