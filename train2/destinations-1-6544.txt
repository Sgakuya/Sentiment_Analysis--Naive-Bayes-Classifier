I was born and raised in Texas, but I left it as soon as I could and have no regrets about that. Being an a-hole is part of the Texas collective conscience. Yes, there are a-holes everywhere, but in Texas being one is considered a virtue. No where in the world have I run across people who would go so far out of their way to try to hit someone on a bicycle. The redneck thing: Sorry guys, not a substitute for culture. Bush's obvious lack of knowledge, sophistication and grace makes him the perfect poster child for Texas. If you like Bush, you will love Texas.
