stunning, sexy, sultry, and seductive, and also an amazing actress- what more could you ask for? My favourite role of hers is one that i think is seriously under-rated- Joan in Playing by Heart (you should watch it- cast also includes Ryan Phillipe, Sean Connery, Gillian Anderson, and some other great actresses). Her performance is breath taking- she had me in floods of tears!
