I was a subscriber to CellularOne service prior to there becoming Verizon. Recently I purchased a new digital plan which included a Verizon phone. I would do better in communicating with others if I were to use a tin can and a long string. The static is so bad you can not hear the other person and when you do get a more clear connection there is so much echo you feel as if you are talking to yourself. I will not renew this service and suggest that others think carefully prior to using a Verizon provided phone. My previous analog phone was clear and free of the static and echo. The only answer I can find to my problem at present is to go back to the old analog phone.
