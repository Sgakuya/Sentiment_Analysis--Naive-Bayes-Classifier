What the H**L are you people talking about, comparing Jason Isaacs to Sly Stallone and Jason Priestley are you out of your minds or do you just never watch any films, at least not Jason Isaacs!!?! Jason Priestley's career highlight = very very bad Spelling. Granted Stallone has done more things, but he has in no way whatsoever mastered the number of different roles/characters which Jason Isaacs has. Maybe as you are unbelievably ignorant you have just not realised you have seen him before. He has been in The Patriot, Event Horizon, Armageddon, The End of the Affair, Dragonheart, Divorcing Jack, Soldier, to recommend but a few possible viewing options. This actor is an exemplar of the talent that comes out of Britain. British actors are amongst the finest in the world with a solid theatrical foundation and passion for acting not a crazed capitalist quest for a celebrity. Maybe next time, see something an actor has done before making such outlandishly ignorant comments and comparisons - fools.
