He is one if the very few chameleon actors around today, th only other I can think of would be Tom Hanks, oh and Kevin Spacey! His ability to change for sarcastic bad guy (Robin Hood and Die Hard) to charming romantic (Truly Madly Deeply and Sense And Sensibility). I have never watched a film of his that I havent enjoyed his performance in!!
