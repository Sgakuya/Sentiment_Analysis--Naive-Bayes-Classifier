All I have to say is that yesterday on a Foz program, she was smiling while people were discussing the Iraq War casualties. She is not even ready to acknowledge that there MAY have been some mistake, not even for the sake of discussion. She was grinning all the time(sic). I feel sorry for the people who lost their loved ones so grinning idiots like her could make the money fighting over who was right.
