Gravely urine in a bottle/can. Miller High Life once called itself The Champagne of Bottled Beers. More like the Nighttrain Special of Bottled Beers, I think. This swill isn't even beer: it's a malt beverage that's artificially carbonated and subject to accelerated aging via chemical intervention. It supposedly takes 28 days to brew and bottle a Heineken and 8 days to do the same with a Pissweiser. It only takes 4 days to churn out a bottle of this wee-wee. Makes your stomach feel like an army of red ants is building a colony. Will give you a three-day hangover with only moderate use. This product is only suited for very old negroes who have a stomach full of ulcers and are constantly in severe gastric distress anyway. They won't feel any difference.
