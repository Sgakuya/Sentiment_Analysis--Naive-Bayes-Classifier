One of my favorite movies is still The Graduate what a wonderful role he played as the aimless recent graduate who falls into an affair with his parents friend Mrs. Robinson and hey call me crazy but youch! she was looking pretty good at the time. That may have been a tough call for a lot of 21 yr. old men. It's only gotten better since then...All the Presidents Men..The Marathon Man okay okay so he's had a few dogs like Family Business or Outbreak but all in all I'd say he deserves an Edgar Derby double thumbs up.
