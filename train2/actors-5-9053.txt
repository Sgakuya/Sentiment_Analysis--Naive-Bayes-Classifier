I am not a fan of Meryl Streep but I must recognize her tremendous and powerful talent she has proven over the las 20 years. It seems that you, LYRICAL, have not seen some of her films; if you had, you wouldn't say (or write) so about the characters she's portrayed. I recommed you to watch Meryl on films such as Sophie's Choice, Out of Africa, Bridges of Madison County, Plenty, Ironweed, A cry in the dark, Silkwood, and French Lieutenat's Woman. And then LYRICAL, you will realize how excellent and versatile actress Streep is, and maybe, you will show more respect for her.
