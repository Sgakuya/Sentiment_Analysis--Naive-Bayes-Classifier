I'm only 12 but I think that Get Fuzzy gets the humor out of all the boring political things out there. Also it's so funny because the things they joke about that have to do with current events are SO true! Bucky's sarcasm and gullible Satchels thoughts are always fun to read. Darb Conely did a wonderful job describing how cats act. Bucky is who I think my cat would be like if he could talk.
