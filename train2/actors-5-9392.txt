To me, she is one of the greatest person on earth. Not just actress. She has brains and I cant believe people are rating her as terrible. These people have probably only a fraction of her IQ and sex appeal. Just remember her stunning performance with DeNiro at age 13 in taxi Driver! She has a french litterature degree and dubs all her movies in french herself. She speak better french than most french-speaking persons which is amazing especially coming from an american woman. We are all humbled by her body, mind talent and accomplishments.
