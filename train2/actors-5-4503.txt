Elijah was good in The War and The Ice Storm, but from The Fellowship of the Ring to The Return of the King his acting skills have matured remarkably. He was Frodo! He embodied the character so believably it will take some convincing to tell me he isn't really a hobbit of Middle Earth. Elijah injected complexity, pathos and warmth into his portrayal of Frodo and with his startling blue eyes and elvish features they couldn't have picked an actor better suited to the role. He needs to distance himself now from fantasy and continue to develope in adult roles, which I believe he will do. One day Elijah Wood will be recognised as a truly great actor if he keeps on choosing the right films. Wishing you all the best Elijah!
