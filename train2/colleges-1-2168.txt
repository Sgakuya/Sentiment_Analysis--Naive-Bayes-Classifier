I go to Oberlin, so perhaps my understanding of the culture of a normal midwestern college is limited, but whenever I've visited my friend at Miami, I've felt horrendously out of place and the whole frat/sorority let's get drunk culture seemed overwhelming. I guess it's okay if you just want to re-live high school again. If you're a hippie wierdo like me, you should probably shy away from it.
