she does NOT play the same part over and over--she just consistently plays roles which differ from the standard romantic comedy female leads most other popular actresses choose. but i could see how a simple minded person could confuse the two. she's an incredible, unique, talented actress and it's harsh but i honestly believe that anyone who doesn't recognize this has no taste.
