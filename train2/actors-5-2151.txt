A great actor must be versatile: funny, serious, friendly and creepy. Can you name three other actors who could go from Mork to Popeye to Adrian Cronhour to Mrs. Doubtfire to Sy the Photo Guy? You may disagree w/ Williams' politics or think he should only do comedy; you may think his comedy sucks, and he should only do movies like What Dreams May Come. But no matter what, anyone who has seen enough of his work likes something Robin has done. And that, my friends, is the definition of a Great Actor.
