Loved it. Had Tom Marvolo Riddle in it too. Very sexy and very evil he was. Dumbledore's death...wow, so tragic but a necessary evil otherwise Harry would of never stopped really hiding from Voldemort behind various folks and nothing woulda of really happened. Looking forward to the 7th Book...I predict ze title will be, Harry Potter and the Attack of the Imperial Stormtroopers of DJ Bob Sinclar...in which involves...disco music, Voldemort and Harry of course, Hermione and Ron OWNING! the dance floor, Draco grumbling and Lucius getting a hair cut!
