Elizabeth Hurley is the sexist woman in the business today! She's hot, I have a hard time functioning properly if i see her on tv, or a movie! What she says about 'MM' doesn't affect me or the way I think about that smokin' hot lady! I just saw her new movie Bedazzled , and not only can she act, but she's better than the majority. I think that anybody who says any bad things about a woman like that, has to be a woman! ( OR ? )
