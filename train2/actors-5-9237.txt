I can not believe I never noticed Diane Lane before The Glass House. Since then I've been following her career. She is utterly talented and beautiful. She was excellant on Unfaithful . If you haven't seen this movie you should. It will convince you. If you want a family movie try My Dog Skip she was really adorable in it.I agree she should be #1.
