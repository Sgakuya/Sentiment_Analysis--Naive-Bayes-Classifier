This has got to be THE cartoon for left wing boomers (and retro anti-establishment types who romanticize the late '60's) still clinging to their hatred of the government and still blaming all the woes of the world on their parent s generation. It no doubt also has great appeal for those who enjoy sitcoms with a message (oh, spare me). I don't always disagree with everything he says but I do think a cartoon should at least try to be humorous. The only funny thing about Trudeau that I can see is that he tends to be every bit as arrogant, narrow minded and bigoted in his own way as the people he berates. And what is it with those weird squared-off noses for some reason that just drives me crazy!
