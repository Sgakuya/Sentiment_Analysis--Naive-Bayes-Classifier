All of the recent talk of Ted Williams being a true American hero, which he was, instantly brought Jimmy Stewart to mind. I doubt if ANY celebrity put it on the line as often as Stewart willingly did in WW11. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who flew in bombers over occupied Europe deserves the respect and gratitude of every citizen in every country in the free world. Their casualty rate was the highest of any of the other services, with the possible exception of the submariners. The thought of falling to my death in a B-17 spinning out of control is horrible. Jimmy Stewart VOLUNTEERED for this. Not only was he a great actor, and a great person, but he was a genuine hero. This man's life should be made into a movie.
