Alright... Perhaps this is the easiest guy on your list to pick on. Baywatch sucks right? Everyone over the age of 8 knows it's perhaps the dumbest show on TV. No one will ever take this guy seriously. And yes David Hasselhoff may be one of the most pathetic actors on TV. You may wonder why then I am giving him five stars. The anwser is this guy is just way to easy to rip apart. It does not take much of an opinion to know this guy sucks. I am giving him five stars because I want to against main stream opinion, and say Hey he might be an DeNiro waiting to happen. We'll see:) If I begin to get bothered in the night thinking that I gave Hasselgoff 5 stars and Damon only 4 I might have to come back and change it.
