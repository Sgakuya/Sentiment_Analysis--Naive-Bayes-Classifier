This is hands down my favorite book of all time. The narration is interesting. The ideas are appealing. Even if Holden does not speak the truth, the book does. You can see where he is right on some points and where he has things to learn on others. And that's what the book is about. The balance between the ideals of youth and the reality of growing up. One must discover where this balance lies and determine what ideals of youth can be compromised, what must be eliminated, and what must be held onto. I'm a big fan of payoffs and I have to say that discovering the meaning of The Catcher in the Rye was one of the best payoffs that I've ever read. Anyone who is or has grown up will enjoy this book. I read it when I was and then again now that I have (for the most part... I'm 20). And I loved it both times.
