This is a sports car?! With a standard 4 cynlindar?! And they call it sport?! Get a real sports car with a V8! Even a V6 Celica is better than this. Again, people buy this just becuase of the price. They dont understand that these things are the worst vehicles on the planet. Your $16k Tiburon will be worth about $7k after only one year!
