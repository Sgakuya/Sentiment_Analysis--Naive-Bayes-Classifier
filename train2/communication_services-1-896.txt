I bought an STi Mobile, Nokia phone, basing my decision in part on the FREE MINUTES INCLUDED displayed prominently on the box. After activating the phone, STi Mobile refused to provide any free minutes, claiming that the packing was old. I called their customer service dept. four times during which I pointed out that they were in violation of the Unlawful Trade Practices Act of Oregon (my state). The customer service representatives politely acknowledge this, but still refused to provide any free minutes. Clearly a rip-off, I strongly advise avoiding this company.
