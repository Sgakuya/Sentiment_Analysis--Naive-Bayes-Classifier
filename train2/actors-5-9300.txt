How anyone can award her fewer than five stars is absolutely baffling to me. She is flawless in every role she undertakes. Sure, the movie isn't always great, but she damn sure is! I think the earliest movie I noticed her in was Straight Time with Dustin Hoffman, but I could be hallucinating that one. Man, she can do no wrong!
