I can't stand Ann Coulter. She's a raving maniac! She actually has the audacity to blame the religion of Islam itself for the 9/11 attacks. She's so far out in right field, I don't even think you can find her on the political spectrum. Everybody outside of the Fox Newsroom sees her name and thinks psycho .
