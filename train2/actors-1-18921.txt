Spike Lee is creating movies these days, and just finished his work on the movie, Bamboozled, but I'm telling you that this guy isn't a good director at all. I mean all of his movies are low-budget, no-brainers with an all-black cast that no-one has ever heard of. I'm sorry but you're stuck in the spikes.
