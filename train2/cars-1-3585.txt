I have a 1999 Explorer Sport. I even custom ordered it in 1998 to get exactly what I wanted. Before this, I had Toyotas and Hondas and refused to purchase an American vehicle. However, I liked the look of the Explorer and thought I would give it a try. What a HUGE mistake that was! I have had it in the shop more times than I can count on two hands. The customer service is terrible and it is the most unreliable vehicle I have ever owned. As soon as I am able, I plan to get rid of it!!! Don't purchase a FORD...it stands for Fix Or Repair Daily! I will go with a Toyota or Honda next time!
