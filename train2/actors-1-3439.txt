Emberrasing to watch!!!! He is by far the most over-rated actor in Hollywood's history. An Oscar!!!!! The Academy should hide in disgrace over that choice. He is exactly the same in every single role. He does not act .... and he gets credit for being "zany" ... that's not acting, that is just his ridiculously awkward personality. Should be shunned from Holloywood and banned from making any further movies. Thoroughly un-enjoyable actor. For those of you who think he is a good actor, all I ask is that you watch him in Fire Birds. It is a laughably bad performance.
