This is the best novel I've ever read. If you've ever felt love and all the mixed emotions that go along with it, then you will be moved by this story. Beautiful and ugly scenery is juxtaposed in this story about love and war. Hemingway writes was one of the first to write with plain language that can be understood and related to. He is America's great author.
