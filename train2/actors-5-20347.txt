Alyssa is one of my favorite actresses. she is very beautiful and has a kind of charm that i've seen only in Kaite Holmes. i've seen her only in charmed but it's clear that she has alot of talent because she can express emotions and diffrent characters in a very massive way, something that alot of actors lack.
