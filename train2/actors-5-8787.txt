She's so down to earth, and yet she can kick butt like no one can. I love the fact that we finally have a TV show with a strong women as a lead, who is still feminine without being a disgrace to women-kind. She's gorgeous, talented, and versatile (going from TV to Movies, Drama to Comedy). She is perfect for Alias, and I hope she stays in the business for a long time to come.
