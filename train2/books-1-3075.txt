Anne Rice showed that she was a one trick pony with this follow up to Interview . The entire Lestat Rock God status storyline is laughable and shows no depth. From this point on every book she writes will sell less and less. Only her goofy goth fans can think that this shit smells like roses. For proof, attend a book signing of her's and look at what turns up to meet her. They worship her as if she can give their meaningless wasted late night coffee house lives direction. She has to be laughing at them all the way to the bank.
