It's a place without soul. Our provost sent out a note after 9/11 devoid of any empathy, stating: (roughly) We must now return to what Really brings us together--our work in our classrooms and our labs. Horrible administration. Tons of institutional self-righteousness. Subpar professors who have very little compassion even though everything you read is Marxist theory. Crazy, intense student-body. Way too east coast and unfriendly. I wouldn't send anyone I love to Swarthmore and I wish I had gone somewhere else.
