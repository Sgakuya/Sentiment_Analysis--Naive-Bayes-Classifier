Anyone who can give this stunning actress less than a four-star (I'd say five-star, but I can see subjectivity causing a one-star difference!) rating has either never seen her or has an ulterior motive and wants to see her score low on the totem pole (look at the ratings to the right; it's so obvious). She is extremely talented and polished. She is a generous co-star, who give great support to all her acting partners. And when she has an opportunity to shine, she is nothing short of dazzling. Even when she has no words, her gorgeous eyes say so much. The show couldn't have picked a better actress to play opposite Eden in this controversial, groundbreaking storyline. There is more than chemistry between them; one can feel the laahv. I'm not a member of her fan club and only wach one other soap. Ah, well. To each his own, I guess. However, Olga should in no way be in the last 10 of this group of actresses.
