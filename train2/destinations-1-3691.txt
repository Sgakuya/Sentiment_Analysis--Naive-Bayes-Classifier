What looks good on the surface as you pass through hides the fact that this is a shallow, over-reaching spot of nowhere when you try to spend real time there. The typical Denverite is a shallow, pretentious wannabe from somewhere else. In LA I can handle it. In New York I can understand. But in this pollution bowl where the skins are leather and the teeth ultra-white, I can pass. As for the mountains nearby, go ahead and sit in a two-hour traffic jam with the brown air creeping over the passes. I'll be on my way east to Julesburg.
