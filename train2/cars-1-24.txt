Well i have to say that this Quad sucks Along with the honda 450r ... sorry to say but my 86 honda 250r will smoke any yfz or 450r. to bad they weigh so much and have to have twice the displacement as a 250r. plus 2 strokes are always lighter. less weight = more speed, ill put my r up against any 4 stroke, i promise ill be waiting in the end. Its just so pathetic.
