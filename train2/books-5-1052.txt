A sweet, simple little children's story about a Little Nutbrown Hare and Big Nutbrown Hare who compete about just how much they love each other. Little Nutbrown Hare uses his imagination to express how much he loves Big Nutbrown Hare, only to be outdone. Very endearing, with cute little illustrations.
