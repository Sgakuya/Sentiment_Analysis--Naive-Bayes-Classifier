Tried two once upon a time and nearly coughed up a lung or two! That is an accomplishment since I only smoke Marb Reds or Camel Full-Flavor, two other strong flavored cigs. I truely would never smoke one again. I may have a crappy memory, but the bad ones ALWAYS stay with me. Again with the trolls. Do you have a life? Is spamming cigarette 'rate-it-alls' the only interesting thing you can come up with? We all know cigs are bad and will eventually kill us if we don't quit. But until that happens, quit or die, leave us alone. *as she lights up an interesting new cig from Marb (blend no. 27)*
