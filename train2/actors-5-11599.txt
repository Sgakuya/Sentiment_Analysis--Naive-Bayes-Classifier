Meg is at the top of the list. To say Meg can't act is like saying chocolate has no taste. Meg has a great personality and depending on her roll can make you love her, hate her, feel sorry for her or despise her. That is what makes her great. if her smile won't win you over then her walk deffinatly will. I hope to see alot more of her.
