The terrible attitudes are second only to the rude individuals from NY in my opinion. I have lived in OH for two years now and am still amazed daily at how rude and insensitive most of the yankee jerks are that live around here (excluding my wife of course, which is why I moved here in the first place). I hope to move from this place as soon as I find better employment... hopefully in Colorado!!!
