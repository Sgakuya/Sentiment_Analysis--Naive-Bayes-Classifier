Long before The Fugitive made him a major player in Hollywood Tommy Lee Jones was tearing through the big and small screen.Smart as a whip, built like a brickhouse with shark-black eyes, this guy wants you to know that he is not about to mess about on that there screen. I do miss films like Coal Miner's Daughter and Blue Sky (and a personal favorite of mine - Back Roads) where he is not afraid to be the woman's best supporting actor. I wish he would stop barking his way through recent big movies (although he does it better than anybody) and return to quieter films like the above and a highly underrated 1984 movie called The River Rat. But with upcoming movies like MIB 2 and The Hunted I don't see it happening. Wish he would play George Jones.
