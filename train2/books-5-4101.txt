Word for word, one of the most powerful books of the 20th century. This thing is tiny, but the impact is huge. Hesse was ahead of his time. I first read Siddhartha when I was in junior high school, and while I enjoyed it then, I don't think I fully appreciated it until I read it again a year or two after college. At that point I launched into a Hesse binge, reading Narcissus and Goldmund, Demian, Steppenwolf, and Peter Camenzid. As a fan of Carl Jung and as someone interested in Eastern religions, I'm a sucker for the search for meaning themes and archetypes that drive Hesse's novels. His style is marked by a deceptive simplicity that lets people appreciate his work on multiple levels. If you've only been exposed to Siddhartha, I highly recommend that you read Narcissus and Goldmund. It's the story of two friends who take a fundamentally different approach to life and have radically different experiences, but remain united by a unique bond.
