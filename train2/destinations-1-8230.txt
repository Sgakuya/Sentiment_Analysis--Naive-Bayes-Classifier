Roy Horn paid the price for denying a wild animal its rightful place and appropriate environment. Take such a creature out of the wild and you run the risk of the animal getting stressed out by foreign and obnoxious surroundings: a claustrophic Siberian tiger is a very dangerous, cornered beast. They may seem pacific and in control from outward appearances, but who can gauge the internal workings of such a critter? The passive cruelty inflicted on these show animals, especially the ones that by their very nature need to roam and hunt, can result in a backlash that no one would want to be around. In addition, one doesn't know how these beasts are treated behind the scenes, what kind of tanquilizers or whatever are used on them, and wild animals that are medicated into docility can be especially dangerous if something ticks off inside of them. Maybe this unfortunate incident will put an end to the dubious practice of using creatures of the wild as public entertainment/freak show attractions in that Zoo for Losers known as Las Vegas. I hope so. Those magnificent creatures deserve better than that. The best thing about this is a world class exloiter of animals finally got his comeuppance, dragged away like he was a ragdoll.
