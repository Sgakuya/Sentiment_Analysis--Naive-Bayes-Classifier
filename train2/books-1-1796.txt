Awful. Just awful. A sanctimonious liberal soap opera-from Canada, no less- involving an uber-bourgeois clan and their loathesome offspring. Wimpazoid Michael and his brood-mare wife. Goody-two-shoes Elizabeth falling asleep in the college library during exams. Wretched, whiny, obnoxious little April. Plus side lectures on tolerance for butt-pirates and, most recently, retards. Time to send this nag to the glue factory.
