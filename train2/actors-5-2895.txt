Have always loved Paul Newman. He was terrific in the movies Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , The Long Hot Summer , The Vertict to name a few. But my favorite is probably one that a lot of people may have never heard about. He starred in a movie titled Somebody Up There Likes Me . It was one of his earliest films. Love Paul Newman!!!
