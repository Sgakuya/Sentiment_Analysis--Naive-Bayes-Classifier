Wow, I got a chance to enjoy seeing him up close during Emmy night. In person he is unbelievably gorgeous. His face is perfectly sculpted. I always enjoyed watching fun JAX, but think Ingo does really fab stuff with Anthony Geary and Jane Elliot. Considering his character has suffered from stagnation -he does much to keep me glued considering it's no longer about the Hospital but life according to Sonny.
