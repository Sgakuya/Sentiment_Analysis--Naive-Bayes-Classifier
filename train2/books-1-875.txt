I usually love Shel Silverstein's work, but this is one exception. Reading The Giving Tree makes me feel incredibly depressed, even as an adult. I think it's cruel and unusual punishment to read this story to young children because I don't think they have the maturity to really understand the story. With so much great children's literature out there, this is one title you can skip.
