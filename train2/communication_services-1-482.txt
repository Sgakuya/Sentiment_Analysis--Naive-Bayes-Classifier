I went into Alltel today; my phone had staoped working it was one of the new slider phones. So I thought that I would just let them trade it out cuz the problem was not my falt it was that of the software. I was told that I would have to pay 50 Dollars, for something that I could not control. I don't think so. The they say we can have it fixed it will take 3-4 weeks; but we will give you a loaner phone that ain't worth spit. The topper I signed up for Text messaging, 40 outgoing and 50 incoming. They changed my accout and bill and charged me 1,000 outgoing and unlimt. in coming. With out my notice or verification. Alltel you PISSED me OFF and the corprate office will know about it. That is a promise.............
