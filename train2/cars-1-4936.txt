2002 GMC Sierra 1500 - Fuel pump failed at 41k miles when the truck was only 18 months old. Had truck towed to dealer. GM refused to cover this repair under warranty, since mileage over 36k miles. I had to pay $858 for the repair. Also, I smell coolant inside the truck (likely heater core). Another big buck repair. I won't buy another GM.
