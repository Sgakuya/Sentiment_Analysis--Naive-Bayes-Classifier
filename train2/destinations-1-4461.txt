Hey smokeythebear, you are living proof what an idiot so many of you young people are. I'm one of those so called boring 30 year old types who has been to and lived in Atlanta and knows what this city is like. I lived there for almost 2 years and it's a hellhole. Too many rude phony yuppies, chain stores everywhere and horrible traffic problems. Atlanta has no sense of a real city, it's just spread out forever with no community feel to it at all. No one i've ever known who has lived there or went there liked it, one of the worst cities in America without question, NEVER move here!
