Ashley is by far my favorite actress. She's beautiful in a girl-next-door type of way, in a way that makes a person feel comfortable, not intimidated. She's also elegant and intelligent; traits many of today's actresses are lacking. Her movies are constantly breath-taking and suspenseful, and I can't wait for another one. I just wish Ashley all the luck in the world and hope that she gets more exposure soon; she deserves it!
