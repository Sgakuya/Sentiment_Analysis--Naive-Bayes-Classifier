Such a beautiful book, I loved when Aziz said, what India needs is love, understanding and more love. This book points out how suggestible we all are as when Miss Questead became convinced of Aziz's offense and what kind of impact imperialism had on the natives who endured second-class citizenship in their own land. Quite different from Forster's light hearted A Room With A View.
