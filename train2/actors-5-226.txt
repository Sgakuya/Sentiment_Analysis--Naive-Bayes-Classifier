James Cagney had great range as an actor. Cagney had so much energy about him. He was usually always entertaining to watch. Sure he did great in his gangster roles and they are fun to watch, but his best work in his non-gangster roles. He poured everything into the role of George M Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy, that it is no surprise that he won the Academy Award. He also did a remarkable job in his portrayal of Lon Chaney in Man of a Thousand Faces. In order to fully appreciate Cagney's talent one should watch one of his gangster/tough guy roles and one of his non-gangster roles and see how versatile and talented he was with this acting.
