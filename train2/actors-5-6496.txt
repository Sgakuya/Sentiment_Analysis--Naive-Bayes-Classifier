Billy Crystal is a pretty funny guy. He hosts the Academy Awards with no problem...he in fact lightens up the stage a bit. He was pretty funny on Saturday Night Live...although some of his chracters were a bit annoying. He played a gay guy on Soap, but he still was pretty good on it. He was in When Harry Met Sally, which wasn't a bad movie, I can learn to appreciate it a bit more these days.
