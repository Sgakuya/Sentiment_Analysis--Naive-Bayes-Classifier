To me, Mr. DeNiro is the greatest actor in my lifetime. He becomes each and every character he portrays. His range is incredible. No matter what character he plays, he is totally believable; whether it be an Italian, a mobster, a crazed killer, an autistic man, a soldier, a father, a cop...and the list goes on and on. I especially enjoy his more recent comedic performances in Analyze This, Analyze That and Meet the Parents. Whenever one of his movies is released....I am first in line!
