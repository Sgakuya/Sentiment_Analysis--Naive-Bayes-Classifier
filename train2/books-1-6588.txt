Horrible... books and movies: uninteresting and unending. Back in school, 7th grade I think, they forced this upon us. It could have just been that that made me dislike them, then the movies were relesed and I knew it was unbarible to watch. If you enjoy this books I suggest The Gunslinger by Stephen King, it is a harder woundering adventure and an amazingly great story.
