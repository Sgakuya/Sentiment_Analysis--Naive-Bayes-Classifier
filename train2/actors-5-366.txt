I'm not so sure Henry Fonda was liberal. Maybe because of his participation in the great movie, 'The Grapes of Wrath', people associate him as being a liberal. He and his very liberal children were not very close for most of their adult lives. Nevertheless, very few actors can claim such memorable roles in a span of fifty-odd years. Could anyone have filled the role of Tom Joad or of the elderly Professor in the movie 'On Golden Pond'? Whatever his political inclinations were, Fonda was a great actor who will continue to be appreciated by generations to come.
