If it's got Clint in it it's got to be good. I think there is just a point in every Clint Eastwood movie where you just kinda look at he screen and think Goddamn Clint is the Man! Okay so the movies with the Orangutan weren't that great (looking back at the time when I was 10 I thought they were great) but that's a very small number of his films. The Unforgiven was excellent.
