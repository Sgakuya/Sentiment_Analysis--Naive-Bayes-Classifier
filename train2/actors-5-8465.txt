Despite the fact that she always played the wholesome movie roles (hey someone had to do it!) she never got enough credit for her music. People tend to overlook what an awsome singer she was. Great big band singer Sentimental Journey, great pop singer Lullaby of Broadway & a pretty damn good jazz singer as well (her album Day by Day is a real classic). If you dont like her movies, check out her music. You might like that better.
