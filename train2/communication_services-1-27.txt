Sprint has the worst customer service of any cell phone company and any company for that matter. They billed me incorrectly and I spent half the day trying to get someone to help me. After several attempts someone promised that they would take care of the erroneous bill and it came again today. TERRIBLE CELL PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!
