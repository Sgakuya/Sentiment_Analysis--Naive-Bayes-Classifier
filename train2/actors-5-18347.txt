I absolutely love him! He has, not only brought Sweden across the atlantic, but created a world of movies for people like me who think suicide is a natural thing! I love his movies, they make me feel so smart! If you get his movies, you must not be very bright, but the language makes me feel just a little smarter than the rest of you when I watch Fanny Alexander .
