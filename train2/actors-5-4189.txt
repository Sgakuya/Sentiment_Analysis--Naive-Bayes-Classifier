If you think of Star Wars when you hear Ewan McGregor, then think again. Ewan is one of the best actor Hollywood has ever seen. Trainspotting, what a great performance, I even liked him in Moulin Rouge and I didn't care for that movie. And I think that is what it's all about. If you can make a bad movie watchable, then you are a good actor. Watch out fow Ewan, he'll be around for a long time.
