Not only is her acting second rate, but she is phonier than a 3 dollar bill ! UPDATE: Just because the writers of Days of Our Lives have been really creative lately by casting Deidre Hall as the resident serial killer, this does not make her a genius actress...it has been done many times in movies and even on some television shows...she is still a 2nd rate actress and the new storyline on Days is not impressing me at all...it is just proving how desperate they are for ratings...it is high time they cancelled this show and gave the time slot to a new soap...
