If I accept the invitation, will I get a tour? Among the many highlights I would like to see are the Travel Office, Bill and Monica's Hideaway, the Smoking Lounge(aka the Big Cigar Room), the Pardon Room (aka the Cash Vault)and the Rental Rooms. Of course since the Bush's moved in things have changed a bit and I'm sure the odor of Lysol still lingers!
