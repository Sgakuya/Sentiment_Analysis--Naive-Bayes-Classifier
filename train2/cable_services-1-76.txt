I have lived all over the United States and I have come to the conclusion that Charter Cable Company (specifically in the Houston area) is the worst cable company I have ever dealt with. How can any company in this day and age, close their offices and switch EVERYTHING over to an answering service at 6:00 pm??????? On top of that, they offer all the current technology, but they dont tell you until after you sign up, that certain things are not offered in your area. I hate cable companies!
