This was a good book like I said for the first book it basically has stoiries a nd some life experiences from teenagers that worte in to get it put in the boook and from what they write you can relate, and learn from their mistakes so you would not have to go through what they went through. I have the first three chicken soups for the teenage soul and the newest one called chicken soup for the teenage soul on tough stuff that one is really good so far. Well overall these books I think are a nice self-help series.
