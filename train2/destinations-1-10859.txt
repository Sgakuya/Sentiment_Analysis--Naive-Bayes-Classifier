The hotel overbooks and sticks unfortunate travelers in rooms not even in its published inventory of recently remodeled rooms on 9 floors. You may get stuck in a dark, moldy, smelly room in an adjacent tower that is being gutted out for conversion to condominiums. Take extreme caution if considering this property.
