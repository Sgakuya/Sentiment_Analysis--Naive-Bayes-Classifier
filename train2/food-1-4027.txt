I can't stand the smell of Nacho cheese Doritos. Why does the smell stay with people who eat them for so long? It's almost as overpowering as the absolute worst offender, Funyuns. They taste fine, but I can't stand when someone eats Doritos around me. Especially in a confined space like a classroom or a car or in the office.
