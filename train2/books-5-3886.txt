First off, I love this book! I'm not really sure exactly what aspect of it I like the best, although if I had to choose, it would be a close contest between the way Mark Twain switches between various dialects in his writing, according to whose perspective he is writing from, and his masterful social satire. I especially liked the encounter with the nobles, the lying, theiving charlatans.
