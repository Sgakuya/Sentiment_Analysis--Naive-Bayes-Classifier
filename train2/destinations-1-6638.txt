I must say- Wyoming's hometown boy VP Dick Cheney and his 'respectful' outfit at the ceremony in Poland at the death camp at Auschwitz yesterday (1-27-05)- was 'interesting' to say the least. I guess this exemplifies the proof of the barbaric state of affairs in many of the 'uncivilized' red states. An image I supose of the so called current state of the 'American Democracy'.......This wonderful display of fashion faux paux and lack of empathy is another reason to avoid this dreadful state.
