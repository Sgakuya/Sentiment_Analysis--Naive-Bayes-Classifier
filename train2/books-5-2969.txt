I remember watching the sewer drain part when i was a kid, and i ran down the stairs like a little school girl. I couldn't bear to watch it till i gre older, then it was kind of cheesy by then. If you want to scare the crap out of your kids, show them this movie, or read the book to them. I still hate clowns.
