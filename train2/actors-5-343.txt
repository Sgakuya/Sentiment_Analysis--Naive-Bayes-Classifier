buster keaton is simply the coolest, nicest, most handsome man to ever walk this earth. his movies are the epitomy of comic timing, creative story telling, philosophy, and acrobatics. this world would be empty without the history he has given it. each movie he created has its own unique genius touch. Our Hospitality, Sherlock, Jr., Steamboat Bill, Jr., and The General are simply exquisite.
