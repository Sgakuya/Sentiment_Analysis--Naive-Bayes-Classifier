He's great- he can play all different kinds of roles, and is good at all of them. Think about it- who else would have been able to be a kid pretending to be an adult (Big), a man on a stranded island (Cast Away), and a hitman (Road to Perdition), among numerous other roles? And he makes movies great. Wonderful actor, and one I still respect.
