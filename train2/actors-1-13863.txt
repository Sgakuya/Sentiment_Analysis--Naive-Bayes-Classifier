Like some others that have written comments, I also believe that she is very overated. Just this week, it was announced that she would be on the 50 Most Beautiful People list in People magazine for the record EIGHTH time. Why? There are better looking people in Hollywood than her. I just don't see the appeal. And I've never seen any of her movies either, except for Steel Magnolias , which doesn't really count because she wasn't the star.
