Although I love his movies, I actually believe he's a biggot at heart. The statement he made when ACCEPTING his acadamy award was totally innapropriate. Killing two birds with one stone eh. He was referring to Halle Berry also winning for best actress (and her acceptance was genuine). He said it under his breath, but it was a racist remark if I've ever heard one. If you don't want it, don't accept it!!
