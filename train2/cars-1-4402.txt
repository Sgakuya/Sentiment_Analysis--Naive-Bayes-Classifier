Without a doubt the most un-reliable vehicle I have ever owned. Vehicle is dead at 84,000 miles, Engine failure. In the seven years of ownership it was recalled 5 times, received 2 new transmissions, 2 head gasket replacements, timing cover gasket replacement. Now at 84,00 it sots in my driveway with a blown engine most likely a result of contaminated engine oil because of the head gasket issues. Repair estimate $3961 to fix. Ford said its your problem, the vehicle is out of warrenty. Public beware the Ford Winstar might have a 5 star safety rating, and it might be a comfortable vehicle to ride in. But it gets no stars that 0 for reliabity. Ford gets a 0 for customer service as well. This is a terrible vehicle. I am looking to talk to others with similar Winsatr stories, particularly people in the Minneapolis area. I am preparing a small claims court case to try to get a judgement against Ford to recover some of my losses.
