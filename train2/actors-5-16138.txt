Maurice is the most talented actor on daytime! The humanity and depth he brings to the character of are unmatched. Were it not for him, General Hospital would be no different from all of the other soaps. Maurice has a way of lifting the level of all his scenes and seems to make his fellow actors better. I can't imagine General Hospital without him or Sonny Corinthos!
