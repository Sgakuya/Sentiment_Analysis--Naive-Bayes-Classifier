First of all, she deserves everything good that she gets and doesn't need all these hypocritical people to judge her badly...she is a wonderful person and is a devout family member.. takes wonderful care of her friends,family, and kids and doesn't let all her success get to her head... now thats hard to find in an actress and plus she is more beautiful and talented then anyone... she can dance,sing,act,etc... she is the best lets just leave it at that!
