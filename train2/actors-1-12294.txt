She is extremely overrated. I find it beyond belief that she isn't limited to guest appearances on Friends. What's worse is that she got an Oscar for the sex scene in Monster's Ball. Monster's Ball! Has anyone even watched it? It was absolutely horrid.(emphasis on the Whore.) I find it hard to to take her seriously after watching that. If actors are supposed to get Oscar's for doing sex scenes then Ron Jeremy should have so many that he could sell the extras on eBay and still have more than enough. I'm not a racist. It's just that it's hard to believe that she's black because i've seen albinos with a darker tan.
