I really like her. She's got a sexy, exotic look.She's also talented and cool under pressure. She got Pun'ked and kept her head thru it all. She refuses to say what she is when people ask her if she's black, hispanic, etc....which is curious. Still, to see her in He Got Game is to see a fine ass chick who is simply wonderful.
