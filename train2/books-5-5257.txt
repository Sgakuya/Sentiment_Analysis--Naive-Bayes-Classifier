This book was absoultly excellent. Irvine Welsh is an extremely imagingtive writer who captures what it is like not only to be addicted to drugs, but also just how life is when you have no money, job prospects, and a bleak future. This book transends the life of the current and past generation of lower/lower middle class people of both Britan and how we view life.
