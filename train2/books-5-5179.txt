I love Owen Meany. Love, love, love him. I know what some of the other reviewers mean about John Irving going on and on, but in this case, at the end of the book there was so much meaning attached to some of those seemly-insignificant parts of the story that I wanted to go back and re-read it. This story packs a punch and stays with you.
