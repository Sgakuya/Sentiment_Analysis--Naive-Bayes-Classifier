I read this book four years ago so I don't remember all the details, but I remember loving the novel. It teaches readers about ancient Asian/Chinese customs and is an eye-opener since it reveals several hardships the Chinese had to endure. The plotline is touching and inspirational, mainly because of Pearl's perseverance and nature.
