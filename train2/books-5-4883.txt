One of the greatest American novels and a cornerstone of high modernism. Masterfully conceived, structured and written. Inflected with that characteristic Faulknerian lyricism and infused with many of the author's constant themes: the co-existance of current South and the South of memory and the past, the deterioration of family dynasties, inter-familial rivalry and disloyalty, the spectre of incest, the regret of loss, the persistance of animosity, the failure of the Fathers, the intertwining of the comedic and the tragic, the impact of time. This is a work of genius that makes nearly every American novel that precedes it seem like child's play. His use of language is awesome, his manipulation of perspective so adroit, his control over the complexity of his narrative truly impressive. I have read this book many times over the past 25 years and still come away with something new every time I encounter it. A question to all: Just what is it that Benjy finds and gives to the suitor in the porch swing? What is it to feel like a squinch owl inside? Anyone who thinks this book is confusing, boring or incomprehenisble should stick to comic books because obviously they lack the intelligence and sensitivity to engage a work of such astonishing depth and texture. Other great Faulkner reads: Light In August and Absolom, Absolom.
