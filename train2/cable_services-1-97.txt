Charter SUCKS! I live in an Atlanta suburb and I got stuck with Charter, while everyone around me has Comcast literally a block away. Comcast just keeps adding HD content and DVR services while Charter still hasn't released the DVR service in my area when it was supposed to be out months ago plus there have been no new HD channels in over a year. I guess they believe since they have such a small area they can take their time with everything. I wish they would leave the Smyrna, Ga area and let Comcast take it over so that people that want new services and features can actually get them.
