Do you remember sorting your candy after you got back from trick-or-treating? When I sorted mine, the 3 Musketeers bars were relegated to the reject pile. I never did understand why anyone would choose to eat one, especially considering all of the other choices out there. I mean if you're going to have a candy bar, then have a candy bar! 3 Musketeers seems to be missing key indredients. And what is the deal with that fluffy nougat in the center? I think it resembles some sort of foam- like the kind florists use. Its sickly sweet taste is overwhelming, and I can only choke down one or two bites at most. If I'm going to splurge and eat a candy bar, you can be sure it won't be this imposter!
