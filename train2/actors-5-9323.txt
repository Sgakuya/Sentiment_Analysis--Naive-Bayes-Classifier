Keaton was brilliant in 'Reds' matching Warren Beatty's male cheuvanist pig right down the line. Outplayed Meryl Streep in 'Marvins Room' which isnt easy and who could forget her saluting of the other losing nominees on Oscar night 1978 when she won for 'Annie Hall'. Very individual and very talented and doubt if she will ever (thank god) go away. The best and most human role in all the Godfather films and if you look at it the central and most defining character of the whole Gofather franchise.....In other hands it simply would not have worked so well.
