If it weren't for Ted, I wouldn't watch GH. And where he goes, I go! He was fantastic on Charmed, and I hope he moves on to a show that utilizes his talents, because he is wasted for the sake of much lesser talent on GH. And ignore all the low scores of 1. They're just from jealous fans who are rightly afraid that their actor is being overshadowed by Ted.
