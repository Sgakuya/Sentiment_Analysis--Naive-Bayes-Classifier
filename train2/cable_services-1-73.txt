I get cable and internet through Charter and have to say that they are super over-priced for what you get. My internet goes out at least once a day and when me or my roommate call and try to figure out why it stops working, all they keep telling us is to unplug all of the cables and then re-connect them after 60 seconds. Doing this works, but only for about a day. We complained that we should get a discount because our internet service only works about half of the time, and in return, they cut our bill by one dollar (which is more of an insult than a fix for the problem). I think Charter is a piece of crap company and if they weren't monopolizing the area I live in, I would have chosen a different cable provider a lot time ago.
