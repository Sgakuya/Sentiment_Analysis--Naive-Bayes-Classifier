Tamara is by far the best actress on soaps today. The Emmy for lead actress next year is definitely hers. She is equally great at comedy, drama, and everything else. She also has chemistry with every single one of her co-stars and makes the other actors better. Tamara and Maurice Benard are definitely acting soulmates, and the best acting partners ever on soaps:)
