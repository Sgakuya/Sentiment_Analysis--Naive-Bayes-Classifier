I remember my fourth grade teacher reading this book outloud to use every day after recess. It was highly enjoyable and very imagination stimulating. Dahl is a very descriptive author. I made sure my neices all got a copy of this book when they got old enough to read it and enjoy it. Roald Dahl also wrote a novel for adults called MY UNCLE OSWALD. I include it hear in case you see a copy if it and think it might be good for your kid. It's a good novel, but for adults. He should have used a pen name when writing it.
