I was born in Fargo and lived there for the next 21 years. After graduating from college and finding little career opportunities, I left and have never looked back, never been back in 37 years. The only regret I have is that I should have left 3 years sooner, at 18, rather than waiting until I was 21. Of course, the weather is inhospitable, and the eastern real people that say what they think and let their feelings show, not buttoned up people that keep their thoughts to themselves and would rather die than get involved with their friends or neighbors on a personal level. When I moved to Denver, Colorado, I had more friends in 6 weeks, and knew them better, than I had in 21 years in ND. It may have changed some by now, but I'm not going to bother to find out. Plus, they talk funny!!
