Sadly to say this was a poor replacement for the old MR2. Toyota took a fine automobile and replaced it with a freakish, futuristic midengine that could have very well been a great car. My thoughts? Bring the old MR2 back, remove the spyder in it's current form... sure they sold, only b/c there relatively cheap, decent horsepower.. but I gotta be honest... i'd much rather have a Civic SI, or Integra Type-R.. lightweight.. reliable... little road noise, and a following!
