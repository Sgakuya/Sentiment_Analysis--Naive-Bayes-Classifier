One thing i can't figure out? What is up with this whole city of london and then all these little seperate towns or boroughs that don't really consider themselves part of london, yet make it look like a huge city, the city of london actually only has about 4000 people. I understand the borough system of New York City, but i just can't seam to grasp the one of london, where do those places stop becoming boroughs that are part of london, and start becoming their own seperate towns?
