Will not buy another Ford after the sorrowful response by Ford to their Windstar head gasket catastophy. I MUST be able to trust that my manufacturer will stand behind any major defect such as this. I can tell you first hand Ford Motor Company is NOT a customer first manufacturer. Advice - Buy at your own risk or sell before the 3/36.
