We just returned form a trip to visit inlaws in NJ. It was the first time we have spent any time there. We were in the Flanders/Mount Olive area which is supposed to be very nice. Very nice that is if you like bumper to bumper traffic and $200 meals for four. We tried to take one of our nephews water skiing on what was said to be the largest lake in NJ. Where we come from our sewage lagoons look and smell better than that lake!
