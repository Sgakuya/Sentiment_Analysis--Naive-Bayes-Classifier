This novel is breathtaking, literally. While reading it, sometimes I would reach a point where a character would say something so enlightening, or funny, or surprising, that I would have to put the book down and just think about it for awhile. The characters are so real. The imagery is incredible. This book has become one of my all-time top ten favorites.
