When I moved to Illinois from a much nicer place I felt like I had died and gone to Hell. I don't think St. Olaf was ever in Minnesota (as Rose spoke of so often in Golden Girls) I think it was in Southern Illinois. People in this area think mullets are a pretty good idea. This area is 15-20 years behind the times, mostly low income, poorly educated, obese, addicted to tobacco (or meth, or both) and some of the rudest people to crawl out from under their trailers than a Steven Spielberg movie effect could conjure. Thankfully we're higher income, college educated and reside in a secluded subdivision away from these mongrel-bred, barely educated schleps who have no dream, no desire, no direction and no brains. I only hope to move to a much more civilized area even if it is near Chicago just so someone will know what the heck I'm talking about if I ask them who Mannheim Steamroller is. And they have bad teeth too...scary.
