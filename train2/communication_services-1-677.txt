I talked to customer servive one day to dispute my bill. They hangedup call two times in middle of the conversation that was once I was asking thier ID so that I can continue to talk to same person after verifying some bill status online. Dispute was I went on vacation from 25 days hoping that my service fee wont be charged . They billed me and then waived it off after talking last month. They are just cheaters ,they simple put it again saying the service fee was due. I dont undertstand how they cheat people like that . I have 2 year contract I will recommed never to go Cingular since if they can cheat customers on any thing.
