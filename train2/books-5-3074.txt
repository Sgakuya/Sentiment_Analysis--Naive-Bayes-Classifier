amazing beautiful book. Interview with the vampire was nothing compared to this. The vampire lestat is so descriptive and powerful there is no way you'll be able to put it down. The history of the vampires made it even more interesting. I enjoyed learning about lestat he is portrayed in a totally different light. I wish there was a sequel to this amazing book.
