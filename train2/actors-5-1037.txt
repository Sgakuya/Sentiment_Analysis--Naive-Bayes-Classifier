Truly a superb actor, Tom Hanks is my absolute favorite actor. Hes just so versatile with his roles. He made us cry in movies like Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. He made us laugh in movies like Big and Joe Versus the Volcano. He made us wonder with movies like Castaway and The Green Mile. He even made us hate him just a little in movies like A League of Their Own and Road to Perdition. I can truly say that he is one of the best actors of all time. I think he will, one day, go down in movie actor history.
