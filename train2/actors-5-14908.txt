Too bad we can only go up to five on our ratings. There is no limit to the stars I would give Shirley Temple. When I was a little boy I was so in love with her, even if she was old enough to be my mother. Maybe child actors nowadays are more sophisticated, I don't know. But in her era, the golden age of movies she was the best, and in my opinion, she is STILL the best. She stands alone.
