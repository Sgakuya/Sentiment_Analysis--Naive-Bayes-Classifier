Tom Cruise has never been one of my favorite actors. I thought the movie Risky Business was cute, but from then on, he just irritated me to no end. There are two stars that I will not watch in any movie, Tom Cruise and Julie Roberts. Both highly overrated and overpaid. Also, think Tom has some kind of weird personality disorder. Might want to check with a doctor, Scientology ain't helping.
