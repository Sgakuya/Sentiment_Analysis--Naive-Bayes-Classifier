A director of the highest caliber. I think Steven Spielberg is probably the only director that can be compared to a wizard, based both on his films on his physical apearance! He is the master of our fantasies and our dreams and on rare occasions does he deal in the dark side of human nature. (SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) Although some of his films are horribly cliched (JURASSIC PARK, THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK) every Spielberg film, whether good or bad is immensly entertaining. Truly modern cinema's answer to Alfred Hitchcock.
