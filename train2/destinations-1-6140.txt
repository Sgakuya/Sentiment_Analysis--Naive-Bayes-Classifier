Outside of Louisville and Lexington and perhaps Frankfurt, is very much a 'red state' - rather right wing bible belt,somewhat reactionary- and basically intolerant. Change comes very slow in the blue grass state so it seems. And sorry to say from personal experience populated by many bigots and many ignorant people. Extremely sensitive to cricitcism- and seemingly having an inferiority complex with those living in 'blue states- especially The NE and California. Very backward on social issues- I dread to see what it is like in the deep south. For many in the population that have NO healthcare or decent dental care and STILL votes republican- need I say more? It seems moral values stand above pragmatism, and basic human needs. Some very nice well intentioned people- but seemingly out of the loop-
