An actor so good, so mesmorizing that many times you are left saying who is that guy? He is so good, so effective that no traces of Gary Oldman are found in any of his characters. He is one of those actors so good at absorbing into the character whether it be through both performance, speech and make-up. He is amazing to watch.
