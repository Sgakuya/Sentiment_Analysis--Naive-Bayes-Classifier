An extremely good novella when it was written, and even better now, in the age of so-called reality T.V. First off, if you saw the movie by the same name, ignore it. This story is NOTHING like that, although it is set against a game show background. If you like the Survivor series on T.V., read this and then you tell me....is this not the ultimate Survivor scenario????
