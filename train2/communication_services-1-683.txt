Cingular has absolutely terrible service. Their customer service representatives are never responsibe for their words. I called four times in two days to check my account transfering status, I got totally different answer from each person. My service trsfering started from January, it still hasn't been completed as of today, March 23. 3 months of time, hundreds of calls to them, but it is still hung there!
