This comic strip is the worst comic in print. Not only is it negative, but it teaches kids how to be mean to other kids that are different and out of the norm. Most of the kids in this comic strip were always really mean to Charlie Brown, and made fun of him. Even Snoopy had some attitude that I didn't care for. It really was just never a good strip. I don't recommend it to anyone. TOO DEPRESSING.
