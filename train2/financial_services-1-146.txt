Citibank sucks! They offer extended warranty protection on certain credit cards but they don't honor it. I had a product that broke after the manufacturer's warranty ran out and after about a month of debating they still refused to provide me with the extended warranty. Their customer service is awful, their phone system will keep you punching numbers for an eternity before you actually reach a real person, and they constantly solicite you after not helping with the original problem you called about. I wouldn't recommend Citibank to anyone. They're too big and don't care about their customers.
