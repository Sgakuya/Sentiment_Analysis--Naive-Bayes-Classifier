The absolute pits! Tastes like piss water and gives me a headache. What the hell are they thinking when they call their crap beer. By the way for those who dont know, in their commercials when Pete Coors is standing in front of a mountain range saying hes somewhere near Golden, Colorado he is lying!! He is in front of the San Juan range near Telluride, Colorado 8 hours away!! Dont believe anything Coors says. Coors sucks!
