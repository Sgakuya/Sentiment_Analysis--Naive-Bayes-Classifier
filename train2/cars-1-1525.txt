i have a 91 saturn sl2 - it's not that great of a car because its not reliable- well compared to the other domestic like neon and cavilier its more reliable but not enough- aways broke down on me. It is noisy like heck. i am just warning the people whos planning to buy it or bought a new one. It will go sour on u. Look at my friends sc1 its starting to show. I am not bashing saturns cause i dont like domestic. It just they dont make good cars compared to other ones. The interior of the 91 is messing up. the roof lining is falling apart. The only goo thing about it is that it has good paint jobs.
