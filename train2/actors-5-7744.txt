Martin Lawrence was funniest on his self-titled sitcom 'Martin' (1991-97) as Shenehneh Jenkins. His impression of an eccentric extension wearing female complete with fake nails and jewellery always had me laughing with tears. I wish Martin would reprise his role as Shenehneh in a future movie role or in a reunion episode of his old sitcom. That would be hilarious!
