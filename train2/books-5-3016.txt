i like how this book deals with the psychological rather than the physical. and it's so well written that you feel everything the main character does, you hurt when he does, you get scared when he does, etc., i found this book to be exhausting, mentally, because i was so caught up in the plot and the thoughts of the narrator. It's a short story, too, so anyone who feels intimidated by SK's huge novels can get a taste of some of his best work in a short amount of time. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a bit of thrill, without the weird, monsterous stuff that king usually writes about.
