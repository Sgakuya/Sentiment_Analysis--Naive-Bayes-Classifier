Highly underated and possibly the bravest woman on the planet Earth. Yes everyone comments on her dubious acting skills..and I'll be the first too agree I've seen Vivid productions with better actresses. But did you know this brave woman has allowed herself to be a human guinea pig for both Hiram Walker and Dow Corning?!?! By her selfless sacrifice it is now possible for small, easily laid, alcoholic women to put impossible oversized implants into their breasts with not ill effects but a certain plasticene appearance. God Bless you Tara Reid.
