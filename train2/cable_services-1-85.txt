I've had Charter's service here in Greenville, SC for the last month and a half or so... to say it sucks is an understatement. The first couple of days were great. Everything worked fine. From there it was all down hill. I do a lot of overnight web development between 12 am and 6 am as well as development of VOIP telephone systems. If the connection was up at all, most of the time it has been below dial-up speeds. If I was able to get to the speed test site, it showed anywhere from 5 kbps to 40 kbps, when I'm paying for the 3 mbps speeds. I can understand it not running the full 3 meg at all times, as that's a burstable speed. However, I expect at a very minimum of 500 kbps to 1 meg. I've called in 10 times or so now, each time saying that there are problems in my area. If I have time to hold, I'll wait and talk to someone just to have them remark my account in hopes of getting a credit. For all the time I've spent on the phone with them, as well as the unreliable service and non-working service, I was told they could give me 2 days of credit. I've asked for a sup several times, and only today got through to one. Then, I was told if I cancel, there is an early termination fee. Whoa, hold on, an ETF? Since when? So yes, this is going to executive levels, the BBB, FCC, and the FTC. They've wasted enough of my time, I'm fed up with it and getting a Verizon Wireless aircard that actually works. If you have a laptop and are in a broadband access area with Verizon, I suggest you do the same.
