unfortunately my contact with Citizens Bank was becuse of a merge. Citizens Bank merged with my bank Commonwealth Savings. It was a nightmare. Long waits in line at the bank. Tellers not knowing what they are doing! Asking for checks and not recieveing them! Last straw tried to charged for account open fee on an account that I closed!After giving me the run around for a whole month I threatend I would seek legal advice if they didn't get the matter straightend out,also I still didn't recieve my checks. I have my statements proving the account was closed. It's been a little ver a month now and haven't heard a word from them I assume they found their error. I got tired of calling and going to the bank!!! I sdo have a life!!! I got fed up with the rude people and the run around! I took all my money out of that bank and found a better one. By the way Citizens Bank checking account interest is lousy!!!!!
