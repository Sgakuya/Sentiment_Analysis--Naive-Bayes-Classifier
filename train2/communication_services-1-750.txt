When you sign up with sprint if they tell you that you have a credit limit run!!!! I had a $200 credit limit on my acct. If my bill reached a $100 i would get a call from Sprints RUDE Cust Service and they would ask if i wished to make a payment with them on the phone. I told them I would pay them when i get paid. SPrints Responce was if you dont make a payment with us during the conversation we cant gaurantee you that your service wont be interrupted. Needless to say when my contract ran out with Sprint and they called me about my acct I cancelled service with them the NEXT day.
