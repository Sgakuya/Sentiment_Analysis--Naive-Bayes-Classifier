I had not seen Cote in anything before her introduction to her appearance on NCIS. I am very impressed with the way they have introduced her character and how he fits into the cast. I think her character will help the show and the plots. I liked Kate’s character but tired of the way Kate and Dinozzo’s constantly bickered, no leader would put up with that in their team. I welcome the change.
