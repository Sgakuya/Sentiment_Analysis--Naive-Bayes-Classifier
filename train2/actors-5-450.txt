Oh how I loved Gene Kelly. He created art with his feet, and he was more appealing to watch to dance because it was smooth, high class or elegant like Fred Astaire many times. It was rough at times, like walking with a beat and being spontaneous with ones feet. He displayed a certain charm, confidence and wit in his films. He was great in Singing in the Rain, An American in Paris, On The Town, and Anchors Aweigh. But he was also fantastic in the drama Inherit The Wind.
