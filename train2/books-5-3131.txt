The beginning of a great Trilogy. This book introduces Lestat as the evil, controlling Vampire who belives he is all powerful and can take whatever he wants, from whomever he wishes. The tale is told by Louis, one of Lestat's fledglings who isn't all that happy that he was granted immortality. Very engrossing.
