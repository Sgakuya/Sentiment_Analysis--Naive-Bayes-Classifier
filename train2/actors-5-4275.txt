The hardest test to pass is the test of time. John Travolta was very very popular at a young age and everybody assumed that when his show on TV was over he would disapear like so many other young stars on television did. We knew he could make us laugh, but pretty soon he showed us he could sing. Then he showed us that he could really dance quite well. Over the years he has surprised us many times with his skills and depth. These things can only be accomplished by hard work and show how much of a professional this man is. As he has mutured as a person physically and emotionally, he has mutured as an actor. He plays roles that fit him at the place he is in at that particular time in his life. I think he can continue to entertain and thrill us for a long time.
