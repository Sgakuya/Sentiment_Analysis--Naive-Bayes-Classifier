Ryan is an interesting guy- sure, he's done the teeny bopper roles but he's also done some offbeat, edgy stuff. I think he just needs a good hit movie to put him on top. He is talented enough to go pretty far. He's also damn hot and sexy! What's sexy about him is that he is mature and secure enough to marry the woman he loves (that lucky Reese Witherspoon, who I also think is very talented) and become a loving father to a little girl (Ava, who was born the day before Ryan's 25th birthday). But I still liked it when he took his shirt off in 54 and he held his own opposite Angelina Jolie in an offbeat role in Playing by Heart, and his best role yet is the funny, loveable villain Sebastian in Cruel Intentions. Go Ryan!
