I hate this book, how could one call it a classic? Dragging on about this whole love affair, making something natural and healthy and good into a dievient act of gross proportions. It's all about culture, the culture feels it has a right to know-the characters (parts of the culture) feel they are obliged to tell the culture. The culture disgusts me.
