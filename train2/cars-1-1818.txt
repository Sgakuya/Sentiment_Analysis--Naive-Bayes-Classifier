I personally have not owned one of these cars, however, a very good friend of mine did have one for a few years. After several times of having the air conditioner repaired, the breaks worked on and the transmission, she finally had enough and sold it. The cost of having all the repairs done was unreal. I ve also heard of others having problems with these cars, so I would check the car over very well, ask for any service records if it isn t new and think long and hard before buying one.
