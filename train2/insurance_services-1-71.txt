Absolutly terrible insurance company. My husband was in an accident and he was in a parked car in a parking lot. This guy came around the corner too fast when it was raining, hit the brakes and slammed into the front of the car. Allstate told us that my husband was at fault because he was on the left. Left of what?? I don't know. How is someone who is in a parked car...legally I might add...he was parked in a corner parking space (backed in)..be at fault??? And on top of that the car was totalled because the frame was bent. I literally have had 10 claims people call my house each saying they are in charge of the claim. Yet when I call them to see what the claim status is no one has any idea. We are paying WAY too much for too long to be messing around with this BS. I had some Joe Shmoe insurance a couple years ago when someone hit my car in the parking lot where I lived and broke one of my tail lights and they fixed it right away with no problems. I think I will go back to them. Cheaper and more reliable.
