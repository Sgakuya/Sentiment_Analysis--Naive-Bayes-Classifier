Not much better then N. Dakota-A 'culturally out of touch' regional society, that exists mainly to maintain the status quo.... also a rather bland population- that seems detached from multi cultural life. ND seems to have no understanding of the diverse nation that exists at the east and west coasts. Isolated, as it has been for 100 years and totally lacking a global outlook- which is something needed in the 21st century. In a word flat, cold and socially backward.
