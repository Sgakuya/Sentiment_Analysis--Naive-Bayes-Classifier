Love Tom Hanks, but wish there were female versions of him in Hollywood, just the average looking guy, not superman looking, would be nice to see average looking women getting choice roles like Mr Hanks gets. He is good, he is believable (gee Hollywood types--maybe he is so believable in his roles because he LOOKS like us mere mortals) and has a good volumne of work behind him.
