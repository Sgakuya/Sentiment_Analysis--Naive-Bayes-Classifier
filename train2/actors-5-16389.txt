I think that Mr. Geary is one of the best actors around (including all of those so-called 'great' Movie Actors). Aside from that, I was wondering if I am the only who wonders if Mr. Geary will EVER get married? It's beginning to look doubtful, and I read a magazine article once (about ten years ago) that hinted towards the fact that Tony might actually be 'gay'. Now, I don't care one way or another - but I do not recall ever see him linked with a ladylove. It's his personal, private business - but I have to admit that I am a little curious.....
