I'm JAY from STATEN ISLAND,NY. I really dislike TV shows and the only one I will watch is sex the city! It's funny, realistic to a point, and the stories are interesting. Sarah is in a word,(AMAZING)! She's beautiful, talented, funny the best actress I have ever seen. She deserves all the credit she can get. I hope the show never dies.
