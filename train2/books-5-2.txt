No bullsh*t or ego. Just raw, honest writing.- which is always the best writing. I loved it. His book 'Dry' is even better in my opinion. He's gutsy. I don't know if I could reveal as much. Think about being at a party or something where everybody knows all that about you. Most writers will tell their own sick stories, but would never present it as non fiction, and the main character as theirselves. Great book. Great writer
