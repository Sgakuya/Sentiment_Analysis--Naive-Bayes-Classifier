This is not a sports car. Its a redesigned Galant made to look sporty. V-4's are anything but sporty. This one is better than the Tiburon but still terrible. Why would you buy a car from a company that got famous from making VCR's! Wake up, people. Dont buy something becuase of the looks. Buy it for what it is. Dont get this- get a Celica or RSX. If you have the money, get a Mustang, but be prepared to take in the dealer a lot.
