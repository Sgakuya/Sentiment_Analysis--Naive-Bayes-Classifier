I am an avid reader, especially of the classics. However, this wasn't always the case. As a young man in high school my motto was why read about it when you can do it. Scary, huh. I resented English/lit teachers telling me what to read and when; still I often ended-up liking what had been forced down my throat. This was not the case with Canterbury Tales. I deplore this work. Last week it came up in a convo about lit and the focus shifted to is there a role for it in modern society/is it still relevant. I actually spent time trying to justify reading -- or forcing someone to read -- this book. I could not come up with a reason. Did I mention it is evasive, poorly written and condescending.
