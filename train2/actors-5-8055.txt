If someone were to ask me who I thought was the greatest actress of all time, I would say Katharine Hepburn in a heart beat. I have many favorites and it is very hard to choose, but having watched more movies of Katharine's than anyone else I can say that she holds the true meaning of acting. She has been quoted several times with When I started out, I didn't have any desire to be an actress or to learn how to act. I just wanted to be famous. I don't believe she ever really understood what a major talent she was. To me she seemed modest, but that was the beauty of her talent. She created characters and roles that were acted out so amazingly no one would ever know that it was acting. It all seemed natural and it all seemed very natural to her. She caught many people's attention with her rough edged ways and toughness, but that was The Katharine Hepburn. She was that person that could dominate a movie set and speak her mind. I admire that in her because during those times women were not dominating anything. She lived a long life and gave Hollywood a foundation of inspiration. I will always remember her in On Golden Pond, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, and all those beloved Spencer Tracy films and smile. May her talent be an inspiration to all actresses to come.
