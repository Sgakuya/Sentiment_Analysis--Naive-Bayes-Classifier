I really dont like Julia Roberts very much... I cant see what everybody raves on about in her acting skills - cmon now - NOTTING HILL?? That was one of the worst movies I have ever seen... she was terrible in it... The only movie of hers that I enjoyed watching was Step Mom... She gets very annoying - and that big ass mouth! ugh
