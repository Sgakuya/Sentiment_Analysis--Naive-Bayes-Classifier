Three reasons why Drew is getting one star..1. I hate her baby voice 2. Her roles are very limited. Drew play the same cute girl in Home Fries, Never Been Kissed, the Wedding singer, etc. 3. She made Tom I love hump dead animals Green famous. That guy is so obnoxious. I am not going to spend $9.00 to see her flicks.
