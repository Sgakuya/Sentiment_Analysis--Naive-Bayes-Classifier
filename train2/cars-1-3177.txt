Toyota, Japan, Toyota, Japan, Toyota - bored yet? Here's another boring Japanese product. Honda, Toyota, Datsun opps I mean Nissen. Even the names are boring, but they keep the Japanese stocked with a good supply of American Money. Gee maybe they will take over our country and run it better too! Give me a good old American vehicle anyday - I mean something with an American Name. Perish the thought of GM, Ford and Chrysler going out of business and then we'd be stuck with all the boring Jap Crap!
