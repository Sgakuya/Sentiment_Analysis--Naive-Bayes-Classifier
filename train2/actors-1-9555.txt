She's a shallow person with minimal talent. Get her off the screen, please! She is quick to judge other women and put them down. Take a look at her in the early 90's and take a look at her now. She doesn't look like the same person. Her famous words are Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. Well, guess what Catherine, you weren't born beautiful, you had to pay for it! You were actually not so attractive before your surgeries, so stop putting down other women! You can't act, and the best thing that could happen is that you divorce your tiny little rich husband and move back to Whales! Of course there is another way to get rid of you....Put a mirror at the bottom of a pool! You suck!
