I read this book many many years ago, yet it still stands out in my mind like a recent read. I adore Owen Meany, and this is one of my all time favorite contemporary novels. I wished it were longer, and I think I'll read it again pretty soon, probably will again wish it could go on longer.The characters are so wonderful, the writing is so classically Irving (that means great), and as usual with his writing, the emotional tour de force is so well executed that I didnt mind laughing through my tears. And this book made me laugh harder than about anything Ive ever read. I LOVE this book!
