At&t has the worst customer service, they leave you on hold so long. My best friend and I called and we were holding for a hour and then when they finally got on the phone it took a hour for them to help us. I can't use my cell phone in my own house or in my job at all, their reception sucks so bad. I wouldn't recommend anybody to switch to At&t. THEY SUCK!!!!!
