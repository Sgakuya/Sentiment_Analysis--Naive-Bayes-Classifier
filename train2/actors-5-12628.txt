Some of the bitchy comments from female posters here a a tad strong methinks!!! Envy and sour grapes for sure. She's a very accomplished and versatile actress for starters. I've seen her in a number of interviews and she comes across as well grounded, not up her own fundament and can also take a joke. As for her appearance..scuse me while I stop drooling. She's female beauty perfected and as for those gorgeous legs!!!!
