Cingular plain stinks. The customer service i received was beyond awful:I had attitude, disinterest, and one rep even was screaming at me not to cancel my account. I did though, and I am glad to be rid of this horrible company. The cancel fees i had to pay are preferable to dealing with this poor, overpriced, hidden fee Garbage.
