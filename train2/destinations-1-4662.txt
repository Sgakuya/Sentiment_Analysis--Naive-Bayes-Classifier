The place blows big time. The people are fat, speak with god awful accents, are brain dead, and consider St.Louis to be a big city.A big city it is not. Summer is hellaciously hot and all their is to do is go to Cardinal games. Downtown is a ghost town, even with people buying up lofts downtown it is on life support. No grocery store, no cleaners, awful transit, and an ever persistent crime element that always seems to follow you around when in anypart of the city. Tourists watch out, the african americans downtown will approach you for money and if you don't ahve it, you will beaten or shot trust me!!! I left St.Louis 7 years ago for Chicago and love the windy city, it is the very best!!!!
