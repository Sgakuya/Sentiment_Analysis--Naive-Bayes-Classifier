I used to work for this company in Reno, NV. Judging from the comments here, things haven't changed a bit. Without a doubt, the WORST job I've ever had. Sexist management, junior-high politics, unfair commission structure, and moronic tech support. I was the only sales rep in the state, and the training consisted of a lunch meeting and a pamphlet/coverage map. I'm not kidding. Still, I set sales records month after month, only to be harrassed by management in offices who couldn't compete. It was a nightmare, and I finally walked away. Horrible company, run by horrible people.
