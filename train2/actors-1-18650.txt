After the extremely successful and enjoyable Get Smart, Mel Brooks moved on to make some of the worst comedy movies of all time. Spaceballs is an extremely weak parody of Star Wars and merchandising. History of the World, Part I is extremely offensive, boring, and in poor taste. Blazing Saddles is equally unfunny--bogged down in some of the worst profanity phrases ever as well as some of film's most tastless gags. Even worse, Brooks is an awful actor--but makes his way into all of his films.
