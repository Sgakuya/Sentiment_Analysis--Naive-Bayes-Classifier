This rating isn't about FU, its about banks in general. I agree with liberty. I'm from the UK and have worked for 3 major banks. With one of them I was on a training scheme for CS, snd what they do is appalling. You can set up an overdraft, you don't have to pay for it if you don't use it, they'll charge you quite a high interest rate if you do, and then they'll increase your limit without asking for your permission. All they are interested in is making sure you use as many products as possible so they can make more money. Banks are businesses and all they are interested in overall is their profit margins.
