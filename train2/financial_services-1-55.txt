I contacted USB to ask to have a payment due date changed from the 1st to the 15th. They said that they would be glad to do it for a $50 fee. Three other banks and Toyota Financial were also glad to do it for me without a fee. It's not hard to figure out where USB priorities are. Their corporate moto should be show me the money'.
