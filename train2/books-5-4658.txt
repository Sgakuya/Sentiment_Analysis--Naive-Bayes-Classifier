I had to read three books as a junior in high school: this, The Grapes of Wrath, Slaughter-House Five. This was my favorite. Jurgis actually did some interesting things (worked in a manure factory, went to jail, became homeless, beat up his wife's boss). He was a man of character. Oh yeah, I knew meat was vile before I read the book. One more thing: The last 50 pages where ol' Upton tries to convert me into a Socialist... Just STOP!
