hurley is one of the most appallingly talentless actresses i've ever had to wince through. she stars, along with demi moore, tori spelling, melanie griffith, keanu reeves, kevin kostner and lauren holly in my worst film of all time nightmare (directed by ken russell, music by michael bolton, screenplay by whoever wrote terms of endearment ). hurley is possibly the only person on the planet who could call attention to just how bad she is merely by saying Austin! she is also quite obviously enamoured of herself, leading me to believe that her child is the product of parthenogenesis.
