I disagree with the other users who have rated this book, I loved 'We Were the Mulvaneys.' True, it was a bit depressing and heartbreaking, but so is life at times. In the beginning, I was immediately drawn into the family, oh how I wish I was a Mulvaney..then, tragedy strikes, but the reader can't escape, Oates has drawn you in so completely and let you enjoy the happiness and rewards of being a part of this family, now you have to deal with the consequences of the tragedy, how people react and the heartbreak that follows. This is truly one of those books that you can't put down, and it is does not disappoint. You will cry, laugh, become frustrated ..all of the incredible emotions that an amazing book evokes. Seeing the events through the youngest (Judd) child's eyes doesn't give us a clear picture of the oldest child, Mike Jr. which is realistic..and satisfying, in many ways Mike Jr. is simply a reflection of his father..all of the other siblings and the parents are beautifully described..Marianne's life is most compelling, however, you can't overlook Patrick's change in lifestyle after executing justice. A wonderful book that left me satisfied, unlike Bookworm, I appreciated and was satisfied with the ending, this isn't a fairy tale, this is life and Oates demonstrates it very well.
