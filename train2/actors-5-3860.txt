From Boo Radley ( To Kill a Mockingbird ) to Tom Hagen ( The Godfather ) to Gus McCrae ( Lonesome Dove ) this man has never put in a less than brilliant performance. He is one of the most versatile, gifted actors ever. Actors with that kind of range are completely fascinating to watch and you never have to wonder why they re doing what they do for a living.
