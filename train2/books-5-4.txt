i have just read charred souls and i was devastating. I do think the editors could have dealt with the grammer better but overall the book had no faults apart from the odd repition which became annoying. I really think trena cole is an amazing person and i would love her mother and father to find out about this book so that they can truly understand what trena went through, along with her brothers and sisters. Well done trena i hope everthing works out for you your amazing.xx
