There's nothing like a Stephen King book to put one's own problems in perspective. THE STAND is the best what if book I've ever read, (and I read constantly), you just can't be too concerned with a leaky faucet, car trouble, or anonymous phone calls with a 'super flu' to keep you occupied. But seriously folks...this book will make you think about your priorities and count your blessings. I've read it more than once, separated by years and vastly altered circumstances, and it is astounding how, with changing times, age, and experience, different parts of the story affected me. For instance, before children, during a pregnancy, or after a child has started school you may react to various story lines differently than you did before, like I did. Therefore, if it's been a while, I recommend you read it again and again. If nothing else, it will present your troubles in a new light.
