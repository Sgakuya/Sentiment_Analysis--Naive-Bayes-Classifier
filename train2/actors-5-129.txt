I've seen Humphrey in Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn and I just recently caught him in Casablanca with Ingrid Bergman. Humphrey possesses a swave, dimure, coolness about him on screen. He barely makes any effort with his facial expressions and his body language is not something that I would say speaks volumes and yet still he seems so effective and you can't seem to take your eyes off him, you feel your going to miss something if you do as he draws his viewers in. Hes definitely got the magic x-factor without a doubt as I don't know any actor today that can even be compared to Humphrey Bogart not even in their style of acting.
