I was in GA and am now in South FL. New top LG phone. It drops calls every 5 min. They are unable to correct. They told me to call 611 each time it does this. It does not matter where I am - no one can hear me, I hear every other word (distorted)...I had cingular for many years never had a dropped call. I wish I could sue. I purchased two phones and a huge two year contract. Absoutley unacceptable.
