I am giving her this high rating because of her work on the Dick Van Dyke Show. She was one of the most gifted comediennes ever. She was good in all areas, but her voice was her best asset - people marvel at her ability to cry funny but she inspired laughter with that voice in all other situations as well. It also didn't hurt that she was the most attractive girl on television in those days.
