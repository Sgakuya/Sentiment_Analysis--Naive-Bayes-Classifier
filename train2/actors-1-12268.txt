HALLE BERRY IS PRETTY WAY OVERATED BY LOOKS AND ACTING SKILLS. TO ME SHE IS NOT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD SHE CAN BE CONSIDERE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN THE WORLD ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER WOMEN. IT'S SO SAD THAT PEOPLE WORSHIP ANOTHER HUMAN BEING SO MUCH BUT WHEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND DOES NOT FEEL THE SAME THE ONLY THING THEY CAN SAY IS YOUR'RE HATING OR JEALOUS BECAUSE YOUR OPINION IS DIFFERENT. THE LAST TIME I CHECKED EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN OPINIONS AND WE DO NOT ALL HAVE THE SAME IDEAL OF WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL. LOVE PEACE AND SOUL!
