While I'm not a CTU student, I work with four people who are. In one case, a coworker is about to graduate with a software engineering degree. Not only can he not write a single line of code but, yesterday he asked me what a "text editor" was. I have no formal computer related education nor do I consider myself particularly computer literate however, I can answer all of his computer related questions correctly. Yet another coworker completed a CTU software engineering masters and has almost no understanding of computers beyond that of a typical computer user. How can this school be accredited? Even though I work with CTU students, my employer is a federal technical contractor and explicitly does not hire employees with CTU degrees.
