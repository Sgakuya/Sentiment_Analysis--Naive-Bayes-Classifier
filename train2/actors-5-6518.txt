With the exception of a few embarrasing flops (i.e. The Tuxedo ), Jackie Chan has had a great reputation for action flicks. I respect that he does all his own stunts (except for in the above mentioned movie, but hey, everyone makes mistakes), and how well choreographed the kung fu sequences are. It's a shame that he can't really pursue a true acting career at the moment, due to his reputation as a comedic stunt guy who does kung fu. A very amiable guy who seems as much as a nice guy in real life as the characters he plays in his movies.
