Ok. I don't know where all this he always does the same type of movies thing is comming from. Have you actually watched all of Gibson's movies? What genre hasn't he done?!?!?!! He's done, action (we all know that), he's done drama, he's done comedy, and he's done romance. What am I missing? Oh, yeah Sci-Fi. Big friggin' WOOP!!!! HE's a terrific actor. Everytime I see a movie of his I just realize he gets better by the minute. Acting comes so easily to him. Some of the actors out today just wish they would have half of his talent!
