This is my favourite book. Dean Koontz plays with your emotions at the end by making you feel sorry for the monster. This is Dean Koontz best book by miles. A genetically engineered dog, hunted by some jealous monster. Its completely original but like all his other books - is all about conspiracy. This is a must-read... over and over again. It never loses anything even if you know the book line-by-line.
