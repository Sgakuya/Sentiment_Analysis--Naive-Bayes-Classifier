One of the most hilarious comic strips to come around in recent years. This stirp takes the dull, boring business world, exposes it's stupidity (maybe too much), and makes it entertaining and hilarious. The TV show was great too (while it lasted). It should have been on a different network other than UPN. That's a show they should bring back. Overall, I always have a good laugh every sunday morning thanks to Dilbert.
