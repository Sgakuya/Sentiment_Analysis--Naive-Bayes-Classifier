I can't believe that people don't rate Cary Grant higher than this. He is probably the best and most diverse of Classic Actor ever. I mean I could watch Philadelphia Story, Notorius (sp?) and North By Northwest forever and never get tired of them and always find something new to appreciate about Cary Grant's acting and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
