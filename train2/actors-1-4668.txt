I am a hugh fan of Jim Carrey...have loved all his movies...until this one...Me, myself and Irene. This is the first time in my life that I fell asleep in a movie theater and I was not even tired. The whole thing was stupid....triplets by a black midget...oh pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee!! I love sexual humor but even I (and u have to get up pretty early in the mornin to offend me) was offended!! Why in the world he did this movie was beyond me...reminds me of when Robin Williams did Popeye , never understood that one either. I just dont get it and I wish I could get my 7 bucks back. The popcorn was better then the movie and it even sucked!
