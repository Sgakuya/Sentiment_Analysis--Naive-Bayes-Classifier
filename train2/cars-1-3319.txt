Terrible. While the front is reasonably roomy, the rear bench is low to the floor and can sit two at most. Very bad problems, especially with the horrible engine and the electricity. Prices go for about an entry level Expedition, being way over priced. Cargo room small, but no useless. Get an Explorer- there not small, can hold 7 people, and dosen't have as nearly close to being as unreliable.
