I've been impressed with his work. He definitely is deserving of his role as the standard setter among all other directors throughout the world. Yes, it is true that he uses alot of special effects in some of his movies, but there's still a quality story and quality directing on his part to go along with it. Talk about zillions of dollars huh??? How about 2.7 Billion dollars to be more specific in terms of his worth.
