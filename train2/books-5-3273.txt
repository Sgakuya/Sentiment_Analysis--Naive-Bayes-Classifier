A lot of u will think this bk was long and dragged on, with too much detail and all that - but the plot, style and ability to capture the reader on a deeper yet disturbed level iz enough to counteract it. It's quite a colorful story with many different depths and twists and turns. It's not something to easily forget not just because of the story line itself, but the characters were really well developed.
