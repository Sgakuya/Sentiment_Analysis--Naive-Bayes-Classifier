Well... what is there to say about Jason Isaacs... except, Wonderful, great, marvelous. All of his acting roles are great... I hope to see all of his movies one day, and meet him. He is my favorite actor, and he is witty and charming from his online chats. You'll be impressed with all of his acting roles, I guarantee it. ^_'
