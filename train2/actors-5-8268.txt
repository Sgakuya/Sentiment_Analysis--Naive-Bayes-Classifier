Lucille Ball was the best in everthing she did. I She is the one of the greatest women of all time. Lucy could act, she could could make people laugh, cry, and just touch everyones heart. This is my favorite actress/commedian I have ever seen. Not just on screen but in Lucy's life she was a very strong and brave woman and for that I look up to her in many ways. Lucille Ball deserves a 5 star rating.
