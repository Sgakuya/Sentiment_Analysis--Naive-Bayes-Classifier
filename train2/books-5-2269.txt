Ziggy is one of the best. Poor guy, all he wants is to be love. Nothing ever gets him down. I have one of his cartoons adorning the IGNACIO LIBRIS MUSICA. He is talking to his dog, saying that most of his money is invested in CD's. A little country, some classical, mostly classic rock! Great cartoon that my life could be patterned after!
