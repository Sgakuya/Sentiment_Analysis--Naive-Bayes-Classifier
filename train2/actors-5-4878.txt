What amazes me the most about this talented actor is the diversity in roles that he chooses to perform. Just because Christian's not mainstream doesn't mean he's any less talented than some of the bigshots out there. No one, in my opinion, could pull off Patrick Bateman's character in American Pyscho as he did. In all honesty, I wasn't convinced of that until I read the book. It's uncanny the way he brought Pat Bateman to life. His other work is exceedingly brilliant as well. Christian Bale shines!!!!
