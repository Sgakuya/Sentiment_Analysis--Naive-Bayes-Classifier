I don'tcare what anybody says, Alicia Leigh Willis is one of the best young actresses in the industry. she has the ability to make you feel in every scene she's in. Her annoying tics like rubbing her foreheads or rolling her eyes may be bad acting choices for her, but overall, she is definitely capable of selling any story on her own. She just needs the right material. Her potential is huge and to me, she already is a winner!
