I think that Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor, and I'm right with Kim 11, he is sexy. Yes he does play pretty much the same character, but who cares. I don't hear anyone bitching about it. His characters are people who have you sitting in your seat going right on yeah that dude's cool. You can't help but love them.
