I LOVE this guy. I'm in full agreement that he needs more in depth roles. Every movie I've seen him in he's added an extra sprinkle of spice to. I don't know if it's his on screen charisma or just the way he is. Everytime I see his name in the opening credits I know beyond all doubt the movie will be good.
