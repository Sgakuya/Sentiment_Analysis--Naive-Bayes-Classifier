A truly great actor can say it all with his face, and Anthony Hopkins is truly adept at this. And not just at capturing a look of pure evil as his Hannibal character, but the poignance of sadness in his eyes in Meet Joe Black, or the faded glee in Zorro. And then his voice is beautiful and perfect too; the timing of his lines, precise. And the combination of believability and star quality is another aspect of his brilliance. His understanding of humanity is his triumph.
