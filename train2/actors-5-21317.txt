I remembered the 1st time i saw her on TV was on Lizzie Mcguire..during that time,i so dislike her..but till the movie A Cinderella Story,it totally changed my thoughts of her..after watching that movie,i totally 'fall in love' with her..n i cant stop listening to her latest musics n rewatching her movieS again n again..well,she proved me wrong from the beginning..she's excellent!
