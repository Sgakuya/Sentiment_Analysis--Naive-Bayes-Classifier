I have read this book over a dozen times, and I feel that I am indeed a smarter person for having read it. It's lessons do not serve merely as a caution against communist totalitarianism, as some have said, but against all attacks on freedom from all forms of government. I mean, when the Bush administration declared the United Nations to be irrelevant when it refused to rubber-stamp their murderous policies, it was a prime example of Doublespeak, since by simply allowing the US to run roughshod over international law the UN would indeed have been rendered irrelevant. Also, the proposals of John Ashcroft are extremely Orwellian. This should be required reading for every single American living, whether they are literate or not.
