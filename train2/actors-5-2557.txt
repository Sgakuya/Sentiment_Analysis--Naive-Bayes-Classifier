I'm gonna be different (as I am very different) and bring up with Death To Smoochy, the highly entertaining rip on kiddie tv, as his funny side that you almost never get to see. Fight Club was also cool and I love the kicking his own ass thing. American History X will continue to be what people talk about, as it was a fantastic performance in some very controversial subject matter.
