This school says they are for working adults. But only if you are a working adult with out a problem in the world. I had to drop a class due to very harsh happenings in my life, and they had NO empathy toward my situation. As a result of the things that happened, I had to take custody of a whole other child, and they could not see to roll my tuition for one night of a dropped class. Absolutely could not work with them at all. They were willing to loose me as a student rather than allow me to move my $200 fee for dropping a class toward the class when I took it again. I may have been a more willing to just pay it if I felt like I'd even learned anything from the class at all. As it is however, a total waste of time and money. UOP sucks staff are not human, they have no emotion. The only driving force behind them at all is money!!! So school for working adults? Just make sure LIFE dosent happen to you while you are there, you'll be charged for it!!!
