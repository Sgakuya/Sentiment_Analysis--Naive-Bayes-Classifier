Not really for me as most of the games are very kid oriented. Mario, Zelda (Zelda wasn't a kids game until the new Windwaker came out), Megaman, Pokemon, absence of violent games like Grand Theft Auto... I don't really need to say much more. I can only think of a few games aimed at adults for the Gamecube so it doesn't really appeal to me. Also the controller is really small (*cough* kids controller), I can barely grasp it with my hands. So unless your 12 or younger this won't really appeal unless your a die hard Nintendo fan.
