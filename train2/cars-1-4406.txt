Since I purchase the vehicle 05/94 it has been nothing but problems: transmission - replaced, front end/suspension - replaced, air-conditioning - repaired ?, electrical system (for outage and electrical shock) repaired, check engine light-on w/fuel emissions problems repaired several time. After original head gaskets blew and repaired, engine has completelly ceased and by law must have vehicle insured and registered to keep it parked in the lot. Was offered $200.00 as the best sale price. Ford you continue to break America's Heart and Trust
