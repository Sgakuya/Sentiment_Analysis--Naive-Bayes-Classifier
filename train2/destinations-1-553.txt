Overpriced, dirty and basically like going to Anytown USA. Having travelled extensively in Latin America, I can't think of any reason why I would go back. You want an experience of Latin America? Go to Mexico, Venezuela. PR is little more than a mass of strip malls. Culture? Try Chile, Brazil or Argentina. Just want to go and fry on the beach? Fine, I like that too, but your money will be better spent elsewhere.
