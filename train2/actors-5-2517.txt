I have been quite impressed with his work as an actor. I loved him in Rainman where he did a great job as an autistic man with savant skills. I liked him in Tootsie as the out of work actor who poses as a woman to get a role. he was also good in Kramer vs,Kramer, and Midnight Cowboy. I like that he has played a variety of roles very well. A versatile actor.
