I've lived all over the east and midwest and St Louis was the worst palce I have ever lived. Unfriendly, rude snobby and many other things come to mind. The first thing they ask is where you went to high school so they can judge your social status and income. The people are superficial and won;t hesitate to make comments about anyone who doesn't meet their "standards" - to the persons face or loud enough for them to hear. I lived there for 4 years and will never recommend it to anyone.
