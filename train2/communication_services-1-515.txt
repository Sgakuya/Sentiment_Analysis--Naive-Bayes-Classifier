Alltel is the worst wireless phone service that I have ever used or heard of. Everyone that I talked to hates them and has terrible service. When talking to there customer service department, good luck because they do not want to here what you have to say about anything. I lost my phone and I have insurance but when I called the number I was on holr for one hour and never got through, just on hold waiting and waiting!!
