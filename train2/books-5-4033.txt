I think that it is one of Shakespeare's greatest work. He showed falial ingratitude b/w Lear and 2 of his daughters(Goneril&Regan) and Gloucester and his illegimate son Edgar , so well and believable for that time. And the respect that Cordelia and Kent have for Lear is really well shown by the way Kent disguised himself to help Lear even after he banished him. And for Cordelia, she had the French army to go and rescue her father even after he disowned her. Lear was a tragic hero b/c he brought his downfall on himself by dividing his kingdom in 2. And as for Edmund, Cornwall, Albany, Regan and Goneril, they all deserve what they got b/c of the way they went about.
