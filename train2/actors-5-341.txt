 The Great Stone Face is one of the greatest comic geniuses of all time. His total deadpan aspect in the face of anarchy and peril is a total hoot. Keaton was perhaps the greatest physical comic ever, and in this, was a major influence on two other greats of the form: Jacques Tati and Rowan Atkinson. The General is a most entertaining film, and the short Cops is Keaton at his acrobatic and hell-raising best. Unlike Chaplin, whose works seem dusty and antique, most of Keaton's films are still riveting, charming and disarming to this very day.
