Someone or something about that someone has to hit me like a ton of bricks before l become interested (or in this case, become a fan), enough to invest my time and money, etc...I just saw Traffic and I've been hit by that ton of bricks...I both loved the movie and Benicio, for his performance was both passionate and natural...In describing him, l would have to use a quote l read, that does this perfectly- He draws the camera like a magnet, because he keeps coming up with things that are dark, brooding, dangerous and SEXY !!! As well, he has another side to his acting that comes off as being funny, engaging, endearing and BEAUTIFUL!!! Carolyn.
