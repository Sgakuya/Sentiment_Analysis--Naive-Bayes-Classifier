i cannot stand janeane garofalo. she reminds me of this kid in high school that thought he knew everything about everyone but he was always way off. i just saw her on msnbc spouting about something she knows nothing about-- religion-- and she had so much hatred to spew she just couldn't get it all out. she was shaking she was so mad that other people STILL believe in creationism, crazy isn't it? only about 1 billion people are christians in the world, but she couldn't believe it was still something that is discussed. she SUCKS!!
