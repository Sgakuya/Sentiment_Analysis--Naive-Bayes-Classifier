Alan Rickman is one of the most versatile actors today. He inspires his audience, and when he plays a romantic character he is great, but when he plays a villan he is fantastic. In Dogma he was charismatic, in Trully Madly Deeply he was sensual and in An Afully Big adventure he exulded so much sex appeal, it was hard to watch some scenes. In Die hard he was sophisticated, and without the doubt he made way for a new kind of villan, the kind that you can respect, even admire. In Robin hood, he was the only bright spot in the movie. Mr. Rickman you are my favorit actor, please indulge us, and make more movies.
