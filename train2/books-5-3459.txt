A delightful narrative of Bill Bryson's trek north on the Appalachian Trail. He let's the reader in on the secrets of outfitting; including reading up on bear attacks in the woods, his search for a hiking companion; and, finally, the trip itself. Bryson is a bit of a tree hugger, but much of his poking fun at the government is right on the money. He also includes cogent descriptions of what happened to the forest and why over the last 250 years. I found myself laughing out loud several times during the book's reading
