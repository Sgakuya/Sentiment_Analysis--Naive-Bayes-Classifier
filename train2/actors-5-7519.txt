Fredddie is definetly one of the best actors. He has the looks and probally a very good personality. If I had the chance to me him I would love it. He has been in so many movies like my personal favorite Shes all that. He plays many different roles in all of his movies. Plus, I think he's worth more than 5 stars! I'd give him 6 gold stars!
