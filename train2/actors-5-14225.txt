Hello where are all the comments for Miss Jada. Is she not one of the most beautiful and talented actresses out there? Don't be blinded by these anorexic no talent white girls because it is really sad. Set it Off was an excellent movie expressing the pains and struggles of being a woman and being a POOR woman at that. It is my favorite movie that she has played in along with Jason's Lyric .
