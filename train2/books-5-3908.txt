The perfect introduction to Shakespeare,and if there's one play to suit a dark,wild,stormy, windswept night,this must be it:the 3 witches (and their bubbling cauldron), scheming skulduggery,murder most foul,ghosts and castles,a villainous sleepwalker,a moving forest..and of course so many memorable lines.One of the immortal bard's great tragedies, terrifically atmospheric and a thoroughly entertaining read.
