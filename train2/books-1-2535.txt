This woman's got WAYYYY too many issues! She can't control her spending, her dieting, her laziness, ANYTHING. Indecisive is too mild a word for her; She goes shopping for a swimsuit, starts looking at the stuff, then totally freaks because there's just too mnay to choose from. FLIP A COIN ALREADY! No wonder men think we're all crazy.
