Tasters Choice instant coffee tastes like instant and no, that isn't a compliment. First of all, the crystals are unnaturally big, round, and beige -resembling rabbit 'droppings.' The taste isn't much better. Very cereal-like and freeze dried and there are a motley combination of flavors. There's a very weak caffeine 'high,' also. Steer clear of this crap and opt (as far as instant goes) for Folgers or Nescafe, both of which are decent.
