Katherine is a great actress! Her portrayal of Jake on Young Americans showed real talent and hard work. Playing a male and female role together seems challenging but she made both parts believable and intriguing. She seems like a person you could be friends with and I know she will go far in her career. I will definitely be watching for her in the movies and TV. Go Kate! You rock girl! j/h4ever
