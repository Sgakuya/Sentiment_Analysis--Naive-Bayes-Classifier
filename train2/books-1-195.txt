*Sob*! It is sooooo touching to read about old people participating in incest! Doesn't it just make you shake with excitement? Don't you just tremble with sexual anticipation when you hear about Franklin's wrinkly privates flopping about with Eleanor's big sags? Or how about when they cry out during sex, Cousin! My kissin' cousin! And about those wonderful kids they bred.....You know, the tubby ones with the extra-chromosomes. The ones named Mongo, Downie, and Corky.
