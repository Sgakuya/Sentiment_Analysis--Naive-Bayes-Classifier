Indians only care about becoming a doctor, making money and having a luxurious life. Least of all their priorities is managing anything properly. Seriously. I'm half East Indian and boy, I'm telling you, these people will destroy anything they run. It's just their culture. Of course, it can be unlearned, but still. It's a very backwards mentality. I've visited one Indian run country in the Caribbean and my dad is from Guyana, another Indian run nation. Both of them are hellholes. I wouldn't recommend visiting, if it's worse than what I already expect. I believe they could do better over there, given the high value placed on education and the amount of money they make over there. It's just that slovenly mentality that contributes to the ugliness of the nation.
