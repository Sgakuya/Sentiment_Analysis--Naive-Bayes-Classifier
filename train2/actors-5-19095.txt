Probably one of the best actors from the other side of the Atlantic I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot. He was excellent on CBS's The Agency as Agent A.B. Stiles. His chemistry with Paige Turco (Agent Terri Lowell) was what got me hooked on the show. I never missed an episode. It was terrible of CBS to cancel Agency , especially with that cliffhanger. Hopefully we will see O'mara in something soon (I am really hoping something with Paige Turco, they've got great chemsitry). Whatever he is on, I'll watch. Maybe we'll see him in a movie soon, eh?
