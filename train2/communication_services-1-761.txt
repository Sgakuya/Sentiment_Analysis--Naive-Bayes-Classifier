Bad Marriage. Oh boy! If you have Sprint PCS service, cancel. It is worth the cancellation fee. If you are considering purchasing one of their plans, run! Do not get involved with Sprint PCS. They are thieves and will rob you, regardless of how well you manage your minutes. I am a college student and I believe this company purposely thrives on our need and vulnerability. I paid $300 + phone bills with Sprint for 6 months; I finally became exhausted with their abuse. I tried getting into contact with them regularly, and was rarely successful. At one time, I was put on hold for an 1-hour and half!!! They hung up on me, while on hold, and refused to credit my account when they made billing errors. The Samsung phone was attractive, but wasn't worth the pain, and humiliation I felt after receiving my invoices. I should also add, Sprint stopped sending me a bill in August. For three months, I had to look up my invoice charges on their website and waste time on my phone checking my account balance. Being involved with Sprint was like being in a terrible Marriage. It was abusive, legally binding, and the honeymoon was over after a week!
