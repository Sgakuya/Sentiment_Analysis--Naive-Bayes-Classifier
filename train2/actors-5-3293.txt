If you think TLJ only plays U.S. Marshall type roles, then you must go out and rent Broken Vows . It is a far cry from Gerard, and he is mesmerizing in it! Another good one to rent is Blue Sky , which Jessica Lang won a best supporting actress award for. And then there is Cobb . None of these are for the kids, mind you, but if you are old enough to see these - do yourself a favor!
