Wow is the first thing I thought when I saw Ewan McGregor on the big screen. He is just a gem. Whoever found this guy has a real talent for seeing a star when they see one...:) Ewan can make a bad movie into something magical without trying. He is so cute, and I am guessing a wonderful person in real life too.
