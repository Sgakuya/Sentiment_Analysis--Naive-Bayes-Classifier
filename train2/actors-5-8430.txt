Is there any woman who doesn't wish she could be Marilyn? Her legacy has withstood alot of criticism, and she'll only get popular with time. And it's no wonder - as long as today's movie theatres are filled with lackluster actresses with less sex appeal than an apple peel - as long as Hollywood pushes women to be unattractively and unhealthfully thin - as long as people can still appreciate real comedy, classic stars like Marilyn Monroe will never be forgotten or outdated.
