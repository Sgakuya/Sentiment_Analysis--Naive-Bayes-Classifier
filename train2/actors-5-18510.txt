Without Charlie Chaplin, the other directors in this chart may not have existed. He turned the movies into an art form through his comedy and pathos. I used to think that silent movies were boring, but how wrong was I!! I only had to watch five minutes of The Gold Rush and was hooked. That is the legacy of a good director, that someone like me can come along 80 years later and laugh just as much as those who saw it first time round.
