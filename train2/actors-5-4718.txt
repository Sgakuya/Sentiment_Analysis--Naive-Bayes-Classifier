Actor Matt Dillon in the movie OUTSIDER was the first time I saw him. He was one of those new rising stars along with Ralph Macchio, Tom Cruise, and others. He's extremely versatile in movies. He's funny, suave, serious, other...I think if he had more movies to play in, he probably would have been considered among the great actors today. Fantastically Talented Actor in my opinnion. Alvin
