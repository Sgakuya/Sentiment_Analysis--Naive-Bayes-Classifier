Briefly, this tells the story of the Gospel according to Biff, Jesus' childhood pal. A fictionalized interpretation of Jesus' life from childhood to age 30. He goes off to find the 3 wise men and enlightenment. There are martial arts (Jew-do), sorcerers, demons, buddist monks, and human sacrifice. One of the most entertaining books I have read this year. Very similar in style to Vonnegut.
