I ADORE this woman. I hate that her public persona and appearance are garnering more attention than her talent but she certainly knows how to play the media and you gotta love her blunt nature and wicked sense of humor. Five years ago people would say Lara who? or Oh yeah, I saw her in that one movie. Now it seems people really love or really loathe her. I prefer everyone love her, but she gets people talking... I just wish they were more informed. NO, she did not just begin acting after dating Jack. She has been working since age 15. But I must say, Lara, darling?... What the hell is up with your lips? You are a naturally stunning woman, PLEASE don't start on this botox/collagen/plastic surgery kick. She is a phenomenal talent who seems to be getting lost in tabloid fodder. Come on Lara Flynn, we know you are sexy, we now you are tough... Now howzabout showing those who don't know that you've got the talent to back it all up. *whew* and I'm spent.
