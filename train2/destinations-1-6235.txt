I don't need to worry about going to hell when I die, because I live in Georgia. Picture it: An August morning, 5:30 am, already 80 degrees, and the first thing that greets you at the front door is the stench of paper mill mixed with swamp rot. This state is the most disgusting place on earth, and i've been to India. The people are nothing but ignorant blobs, the scenery is nothing but flat pine lands, and the tax rate is 7 percent! Grits blow ass, and you can't swing a dead cat without hitting some whacko church. Ugly, stupid, and stinky. Those are the words that come to mind when i look out the window. P.S. Zell Miller is a retarded monkey.
