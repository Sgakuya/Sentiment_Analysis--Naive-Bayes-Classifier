A complete piece of JUNK! We traded our 2003 Sonata. More has gone wrong with both of our Hyundai's than I can list. Folks, you get exactly what you pay for. I should have been smart enough to really see that prior to purchase. They lure you in with a fantastic warranty but constantly getting repairs gets time consuming, inconvenient and old. It takes FOREVER for the dealers to get the parts that so often break. Please steer clear!!!! BUY AMERICAN!!!!! Update: Traded for a brand new silver Chrysler PT Cruiser.
