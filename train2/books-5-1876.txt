Love Is a part of alot of people's life. There are so many things that happen in our life that happen on the same day the LOVE IS posted. And they mean alot to share them with my wife again. She has kept everyone that I have givin her, and I can go back 11 years and tell you what they all had to do with in my life. My dad has collected everyone that has had to do with him and my mother since they started being put in the Omaha World Herald. He has a great collection and I hate to see it stop now. PLEASE PUT IT BACK ON. It helps heal the heart.
