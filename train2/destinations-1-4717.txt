I was there once, albeit in 1992. I went to the Motor City with a friend of mine to see Tiger Stadium. We stayed across from the Renaissance Center, which was by far the nicest part of Detroit. It was Labor Day 1992 - it was like being in Missoula, Montana. It was a GHOST TOWN. Tiger Stadium was akin to Eden compared to this pit. They made a huge mistake tying their fortunes to the automotive industry.
