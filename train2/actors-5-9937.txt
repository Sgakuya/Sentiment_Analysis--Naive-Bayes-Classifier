Bette Milder has had one excellent acting and singing carrer. She was a great singer, and had a few major hits in the 70's, and then she started acting in the 80's with films like Ruthless People and Outrageous Fourtune with Shelley Long. She starred in Big Business with Lily Tomlin, and right now has her own show on CBS, which to some is a total failure, but is extremly winning in her role playing herself.
