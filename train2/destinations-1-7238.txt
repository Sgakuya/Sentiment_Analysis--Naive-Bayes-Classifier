Theres something just not right about this city, visited and left feeling cheated, it looks nice but its all superficial, underneath there is a lack of amenities and things to do, sure the castle is great but after that there isnt a lot else left to fill the days......locals are extremely rude and appear to have no time for visitors to the city, great country to visit, shame about its capital.
