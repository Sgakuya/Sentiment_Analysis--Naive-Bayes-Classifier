one of the geatest actors on stage or on screen. his performance in London in Orphans was breathtaking. he gave a wonderful turn as Scrooge -- watching him melt from stunted, blinkered loner into a very human man suddenyl full of joy at his ability to matter to others -- is both hilarious and moving (and i never thought anyone could have dared play Scrooge after the great Alistair Sim).
