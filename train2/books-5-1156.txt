this is the most artistically meritorious comic ever. now i will admit significant gaps in my own repetoire (Krazy Kat and Pogo specifically), but i feel more than confident that C&H proves that cartooning is an art form. reading back through old strips, it's impressive the range and maturity of topics tackled by C&H - and even though it's depth far outpaces any other strip it never presumes to be anything more than a simple newspaper comic strip: it doesn't try to be a political stump, and it never contains anything that wouldn't appeal to readers of any age. Meanwhile, Bill Watterson refused to let his syndicate turn his strip into a commercial enterprise. Though he easily could have made millions through the merchandising of his strip, no C&H products but the books have ever been sold. in fact, he so valued the artistic integrity of his creation that he took further economic setbacks midway through his career by refusing to draw Sunday strips in the panel format. get out your books and compare the first few years with the last. The restrictive rectangular format suddenly gives way to sprawling, painted strips in which Watterson used space as he wished, ignoring frames and panels. flip through some of his later Sunday strips and you'll see that C&H was not just entertainment by any means, and deserves to be regarded as an art form.
