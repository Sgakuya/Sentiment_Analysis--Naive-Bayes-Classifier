He is the next big actor, and is absolutely brilliant. Se7en , L.A. Confidential , The Usual Suspects , American Beauty , Swimming With Sharks , all these and more show his incredible acting skill. (By the way, see all these movies I've just mentioned). Absolutely talented. He can show emotions so incredibly well, he certainly has the face for the business, and could be somebody like the next DeNiro. I wouldn't be surprised to see him pick up a 3rd Oscar in the near future. My favorite movie of his is American Beauty. Summary: THE NEXT BIG ACTOR. GREAT!
