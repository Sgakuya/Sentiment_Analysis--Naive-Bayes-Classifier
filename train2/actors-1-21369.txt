Hilary Duff is annoying, plain and simple. At the MTV movies awards she presented an award with Amanda Bynes who was sooo much better than she was. Hilary seems embarrased and akward in front of the camera and could never branch outside of the tween audience, as adults and teens would find her annoying.
