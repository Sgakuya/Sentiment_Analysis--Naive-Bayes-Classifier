Very good actor. I must admit it took me a while to get to like him. He sort of gave me the creeps in the begining, maybe it was the roles he played, I don't know. BUT, The City of Angels changed all that. Loved him in that. He broke my heart, made me cry and got me! Good work all the time, ever since.
