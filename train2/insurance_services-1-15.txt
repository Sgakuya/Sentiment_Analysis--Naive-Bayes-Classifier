We recently received notice that our car insurance was canceled towards the end of October, the letter was dated December 2, 2004. When we called to ask why the insurance had been canceled when we can prove through bank statements that all payments were current and paid before the due date we were told that the payments were going to another persons account. After trying to rectify the problem for 2 days we went to GEICO offices here in Maryland and we were told that we needed to pay over $1000 to get reinstated and that they could not rectify the problem without consent from the customer that money went to. After calling 411 almost all day we managed to call the person who was getting a free ride from our payments to GEICO. And she refused to allow GEICO to give us back the money. Please note that this payments we have been making with our account number were all given to her by one of the GEICO agents. Apparently when my husband added me to the account the agent gave us a new account number and issued our old account/policy number to someone else and told us that we would receive notice soon on what our new policy/account number was and we should continue paying on our old account number and to remember to put our social security numbers on our checks. Which we did diligently until we received this rude notice. Please note that we have reported all to the Maryland Insurance Administration and we plan to take this matter all the way. We are now working with Progressive and they even lowered our insurance rate for both cars! Shame on GEICO for punishing us because they assigned our payments to someone out there. BEWARE GEICO ARE THIEVES!
