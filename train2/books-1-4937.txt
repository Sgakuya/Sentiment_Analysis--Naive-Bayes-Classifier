Emily Bronte's style of writing is dull and tedious. Her novel was repatative and the plot was boring. I was pissed off that Bronte wrote about 2 houses that were completely different and the readers had to figure out the metaphors of the houses. The novel was slow and it was very difficult to pay attention to her annoying style of writing.
