I very much enjoyed reading this sequel to Interview With the Vampire . Anne Rice has a splendid literary voice and each passage in The Vampire Lestat has a sensual, dreamlike quality that more than makes up for a lack of realism in this novel. I appreciate how Rice attempts to write a complete history of Vampires with Lestat as the catalyist here. This novel is ambitious and Rice succeeds in creating her Vampire world while making it deep enough to revisit again and again. This is not your average vampire on the loose, let's put a stake in his heart story as everyone is familiar with; it is an examination of what might happen if immortals walked the earth and lived their conflicted lives as nearly-omnipotent beings in a world where they must remain hidden or face desruction. These Vampires are mostly egomaniacal, yet are forced by their very nature to cower and hide before the masses of inferior humans; an interesting paradox and Rice handles the concept well without becoming trite. I would reccomend this novel to anyone looking for the elusive creature that is fantasy-horror .
