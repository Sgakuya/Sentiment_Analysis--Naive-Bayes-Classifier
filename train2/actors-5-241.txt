A big mistake would be to compare the work of James Cagney to today's films and acting styles. There s no denying that those things have really changed since his day. But, if you can put him in the proper perspective you may see that he was a very versatile performer. Not only a good actor and dancer but he also did some directing and producing. His energy level was incredible, his mannerisms unique and he was just a fascinating performer to watch. He no doubt drew the inspiration for his work from a rough and difficult New York childhood. I have also always been impressed with the fact that once he gained success in show business he apparently didn t let his ego rule him. He had sense enough to live away from the Hollywood scene choosing instead to make a life with his family on a horse farm in Connecticut. He was a class act in every way!
