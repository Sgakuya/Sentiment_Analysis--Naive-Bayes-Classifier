I have owned 4 Grand Cherokees since they first came out in 92(2 in 92 because Chrysler finally took back the first one and gave me a new one after legal threats,all the mileage was to and from the dealer for repair). I have no clue why I keep buying them other than the way they looked. I lost track of the recall notices.... this year I bought a Ford Explorer Limited V8. WOW What a difference....NEVER a Jeep again.
