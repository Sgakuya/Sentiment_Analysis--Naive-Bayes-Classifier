John Travolta stinks as an actor, singer, entertainer. When he acts he makes me cringe. His only good role was playing Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever because he was playing a stupid, confused Brooklyn kid . It's pretty close to what he really is. He was alright in Grease but they should have chosen someone else to play Danny Zucco and it would have been better. Presently, he is as fat as a cow. The Late, Great Bob Hope used to call him John Ravolta . If there were a way to give him a negative rating he deserves it. This guy is another one of Hollywoods mistakes. Anyone who gave him a 5 Star rating must be on drugs and if they are not then they need to be on drugs. Or at least have their heads examined.
