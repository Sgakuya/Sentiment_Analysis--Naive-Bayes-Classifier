Alright, I don't know a single person who gets it . Is it a series or something, did I miss something to make any of it at all amusing? If anyone has ANY clue what this comic is supposed to be about (or what the humorous aspect is about it), PLEASE post and explain it! It seems like the absolute worst comic about some guy that wears a big ugly polka-dotted mumu that has conversations with people that I guess is supposed to be a commentary or bizarre humor. Help!
