Duh....I have no idea what 1 2 are trying to say, but they clearly have not seen Mr. Harris at work. Good grief people, he's gorgeous, his characters are smart, tough, (and sometimes gentle) men I think would be fascinating to know. With the exception of Places in the Heart, he tends to portray a devoted husband and a man full of honor and integrity, though he sometimes does the wrong thing for the right reason. These are not one-dimensional characters. They are real (particularly in The Right Stuff and Apollo 13; those characters were actually real people) and he plays protagonist and antagonist with equal talent and charm. Sometimes I'll watch a movie just because he's in it, and I haven't been disappointed yet.
