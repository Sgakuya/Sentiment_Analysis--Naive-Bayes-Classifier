I can't belive I actually have to write a review for something so transperently cheap and awful. Smirnoff hs dressed it up, added flavors but still can't hide the taste. Cheap, smooth as a cheesegrater and what a horrid hangover. If you can't spend enough to buy something better (Chopin, Vox) then at least jump over to stoli.
