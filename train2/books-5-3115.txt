Just when I think King can't possibly write any better, he comes up with something like this. Horrifyingly scary? Yes, undoubtedly. But also, incredibly insightful observations on the human condition...this time dealing with how people deal with grief. An incredible read--written by an author who is VERY in touch with his subject matter...
