I try to see every movie that Samuel L. Jackson is in. I am never disappointed in his performance. He cannot get along on his looks alone, so he is very convincing in the roles he plays. He is very hardworking and professional. He choses his roles well and is only in top quality pictures. I hope he is around for a long time.
