This is my favorite actor. Forget about the goodlooks, he is a talented actor. Tigerland is an amazing overlooked movie. I would have never guessed he was Irish after watching this film. While I thought Phonebooth was kind of boring, I was amazed at Colin's ability to portray so many different believable emotions, in such a short period of time. This guy is going to be huge and it doesn't hurt that he is truly amazing looking.
