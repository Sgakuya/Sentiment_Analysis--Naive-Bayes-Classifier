Apparently, I am in the minority. I hat Pringles. I don't like the texture, shape, smell, taste. Ugh. To me, it seems like someone already chewed them up and then re-molded them into that odd shape..they are all bumpy and the smell..ugh, it is awful.they have a strange taste and an even stranger aftertaste. That odd face on the package even disturbes me. What is up with potato chips in a tube? That bothers me. I have issues with Pringles.
