Demi is still best. what i love about her is, if you look very closely, you will find [underneath all the hype / beauty / brashness] a vulnerability she tried hard to keep under wraps. How can any woman [in 'Ghost] have such short hair and still be unbelievable so FEMININE!? I have to admit that I go weak at the knees whenever I see her. Those who say she can't act have not seen all her films but have made this statement [usually] after looking at all the stuff surrounding ' striptease. This film got a panning, I wonder by whom? you see true Demi fans must just LOVE this film which shows her off to the fullest [great body, beautifull face, terrific hair] methinks that a lot of women out there find it so sifficult to understand why ONE woman has so much!!!!!
