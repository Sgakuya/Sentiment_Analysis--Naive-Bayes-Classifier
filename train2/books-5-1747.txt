An all time favorite. The characters have so much depth, and not only that, you see them develop as the years go by. Storyline is pretty eclectic, but that's what makes it so unique and absorbing. Ozy and Millie is easy to relate to, has clean and masterful artwork, and holds enjoyable humor for all ages.
