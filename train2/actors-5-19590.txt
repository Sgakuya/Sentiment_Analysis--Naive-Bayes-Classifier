Not only is Dean Cain a really good looking man, but he can act with the best of them. Unfortunately he has never been given any good roles to show his underlying true talent. I think taking the role as Clark Kent on television's LOIS AND CLARK probably hurt his career a little bit, but I am sure he will come out on top if he does it quick enough.
