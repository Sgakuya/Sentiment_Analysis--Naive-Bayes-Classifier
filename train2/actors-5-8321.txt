My God, what a beautiful woman and wonderful actress. She was so good in Gone with the Wind that I can't imagine anyone else being Scarlett. Her performance, along with Gables, bring those two characters to life in my mind to the point of there seeming like there really was a Scarlett and Rhett. I hope one day Hollywood can get two equal performances out of two actors in the same movie, but I doubt it. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are what Hollywood is all about, or should be, performance wise. They are legends.
