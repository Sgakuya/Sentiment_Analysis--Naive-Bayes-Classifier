Koontz is in top form with this story about a kidnapping. Never before has a kidnapping story captivated me as much as this novel did. The villan is truly frightening and the heroine is someone worth cheering for. As usual, Koontz delivers a book that you can blaze through a hundred pages at a time without blinking. This is clearly one of his best works and I recommend it to anyone who likes a thrill ride.
