Martin Scorsese is at the heart of motion pictures. I've never known of anybody who loves films as much as he does. And it shows in his work. RAGING BULL, TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS CASINO are all very personal films and show this man's true talent. Not many people can say they understand the asthetics of motion pictures as well as Scorsese. Without question, one of the five best directors of all time.
