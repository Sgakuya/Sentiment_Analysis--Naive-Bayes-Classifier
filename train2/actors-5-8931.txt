I love Sandra Bullock as an actress. She is my favorite in hollywood. She always seems to pick roles that suit her personality. I believe in person she is very down to earth , kind and giving. Non Hollywood type, if you get my drift. She doesn't act like she is a Prima_donna. Thank you Sandra for all of your great talent! Loretta Keesee
