I must admit I never really knew Spader or his work until he joined the cast of The Practice. Since then I have found that he is truly a talented man. He portrays his character with such complexity that you wonder if he's just playing himself. He gives wonderful depth and conflicts and has shaken up The Practice-well filling the hole left by the departure of previous mainstays.
