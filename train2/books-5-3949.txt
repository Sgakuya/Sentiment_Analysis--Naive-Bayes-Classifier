I don't know any other book that makes me as plainly happy as P&P. Elizabeth is fiesty and sharp and uncompromising in such an infectious way that you root for her and hardly think her fallible. But as the story evolves you come to realzie that all Miss Elizabeth Bennett lacks is the temperance and humbling that can only be given by a man as correct and worthy as Mr. Darcy. A wonderful literary couple-in them all that is necessary and good to a love relation is embodied. Ying and yang but both highly worthy in their own right.
