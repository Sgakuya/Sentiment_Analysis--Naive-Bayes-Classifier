The coffee is up there the best,but the price is way too high.The coffeemaker(12 cup CM500)is a product you must keep away from!12 cups of water produces 6 cups of non drinkable weed killer,the other 6 cups go up in steam! Keep the children away from this piece of garbage!Replacement promisses go into deaf ears!Maybe they will listen to the Product Safety Commission!
