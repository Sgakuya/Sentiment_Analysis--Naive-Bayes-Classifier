Sorry, confessing to being a 12 year old cocaine whore in Hollywood does not a good actress make. I am glad you turned your life around, but exploiting your hardships for publicity is questionable in my book. I wonder if any of the events of her youth were embelleshed in order to generate even more publicity... I find it interesting that she hit every talk show and told her sad story; you'd think she would want to get such a difficult childhood behind her instead of telling it over and over. Hmmm.
