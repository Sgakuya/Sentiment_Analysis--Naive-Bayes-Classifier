Ralph Fiennes was nominated for an Oscar twice; best support for Schindler's List and best actor for The English Patient. He lost both. But he is a great actor that can go from playing a brutal character in Schindler's list, to a college kid in Oscar Lucinda. To me he can do it all, if only he and Hollywood would stop typecasting him. I simply think he's the best actor around and since he came out and signed autographs at BAM, I think he is one of the nicest.
