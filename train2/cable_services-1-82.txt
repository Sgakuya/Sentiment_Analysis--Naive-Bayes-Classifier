Charter Cable is worthless in St Louis. I have tried several times to talk to supervisor on questions such as why my cable was cut to hook up my neighbor and the service tech told my neighbor that I was stealing cable which in fact I have been paying for it since I moved in. Why ever time I ask to speak to a supervisor do the retards at customer service tell me they won't be able to help with situation anyway and WILL NOT transfer me to one? Why when I call I get a different answer about a problem with my service EVER SINGLE time? Why their customer service reps no nothing of Charter Cable policies? This cable company is the worst ever, I pay for a 5mb pipe and download at 350kb. Infantryman you need to get with your BOSS program and have them push it up the chain of command, if they see it as a big problem the will switch companies.
