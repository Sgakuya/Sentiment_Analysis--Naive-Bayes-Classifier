Julia Stiles is by far my favorite young, current actress. She has a great stage presence and confidence that I admire. She has the potential to become of VERY famous actress and I hope she sticks around long enough to see that happen for herself. I believe that she will always be seen as a great actress even if she doesn't become as famous as other female actresses of the day.(ex. Sandra Bullock, Julianne Moore, or Goldie Hawn)
