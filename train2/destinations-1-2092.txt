Pretty decent place if you restrict yourself to the 5 percent of the country that is safe enough to travel in. Avoid Cali, Buenaventura, Medellin, Bogota, or any other city except maybe Cartagena or Baranquilla. They have been at civil war for decades, and most of the country is in the hands of either rebels or drug cartels, or both. Why anyone would go there is a mystery to me.
