If celebrity culture wasn't so extreme and the entertainment industry was judged purely on talent, this woman would have no job. She's not only a bad actress (who should NEVER attemp an English accent EVER AGAIN!), she's also a complete idiot. To some people, her ignorance comes off as cute, but to me, it comes across just plain stupid and embarrassing.
