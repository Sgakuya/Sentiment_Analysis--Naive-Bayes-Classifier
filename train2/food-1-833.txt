 And what would you like for breakfast? Oh, I will take a bowl of stones from the driveway, thanks! They are SO hard. OK, they are good for you and they keep you regular. Whatever, they could make them a little more appealing. And each piece or particle or each individual grape nut is so freakin' small. My jaw literally aches after attempting half of a bowl (which usually takes about 3 1/2 hours by the way.)
