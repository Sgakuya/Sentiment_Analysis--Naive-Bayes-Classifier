I just love him to death. My sister in law thinks it is so hilarious because I just go nuts everytime I see him or hear his name. I would absolutely die if I ever met him. It is also goofy that I am Twenty years old and just can't get enough of him!!!!! I also have to say that he looks his very best on A Time to Kill. Mmmmmm:)
