I'd like to give my 2004 Jeep Liberty a 5star rating, but during my first 2800 miles of driving I've had it quit on me 3 times and had to have it towed in to be repaired. they put a band aid on it and sent it back to me saying they really don't know what is wrong with it, but hope it is fixed. It's in the shop again now. same problem. It just conks out. Great for a 68 year old handicapped driver.
