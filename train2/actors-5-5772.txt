Vincent D'Onofrio is the best actor on TV. I haven't seen many of his movies, my first exposure of him was from Criminal Intent. Vinny D makes that show worthwhile and possibly the best on TV. His quirky mannerisms are at times comical, but that's what Vincent D'Onofrio is all about. I can never turn away when he is on screen, he is that good.
