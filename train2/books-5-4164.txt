I first heard of this novel from the Greenday song Who wrote Holden Caulfield?, it sounded interesting so I purchased it this year. I am still in the process of reading it, but am almost done. This novel is hilarious. Kudos to Jd Salinger, he is one gifted writer. When this novel was written, some of the profanity, and lewd innuendos would have been considered just that, lewd. Jd Salinger did not care what the public thought, he wrote what he wanted to and had the courage to do so. Holden Caulfield is one hilarious character, even though he is fictional, he reminds me so much of myself.
