I like him as Ross, I agree his movies have not been big hits, but I think he hasn't landed the right roll yet, not that he can't act. If Ross and Rachel don't finally see that they are perfect for each other and quit playing games get married for real, I am going to stop watching FRIENDS! Don't let them turn the best sit come EVER into something I hate to turn on the tv for!
