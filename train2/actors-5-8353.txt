Judy Garland is my most favorite actress of all time. She is the reason I am so invloved in acting. Since I was a little girl I wanted to be just like her in The Wizard of Oz (my fav movie). I will love her forever because of her talent and grace. She inspires me to reach my goals and be the actress that I so want to be. I loved her in ALL her films. Judy is the definition of an actress, despite her troubles behind the scenes. She is special; she was Entertainment!
