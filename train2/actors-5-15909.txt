It is sad to see Stephen Nichols and the character of Stefan leave GH. Stephen can play good or evil, be unpredictable, and he's very sexy doing it. His character had more depth and room for growth than most others. I love Stephen Nichols, and wherever he goes I'll be watching. Too bad GH, it's your loss!!!
