Stephen King - in his early years - was an excellent author, able to pack power into ten or fifteen pages. However, he lost it with It. This books tells a story in such a drawn-out way that you're actually sick of the characters by the time you put it down. I mean, is it necessary for us to know the colors of each and every flower in Derry before the story continues? Must every rock be described? Whatever magic King had with his Night Shift years is definately over. This could have been an effect, completely entertaining 250 page story.
