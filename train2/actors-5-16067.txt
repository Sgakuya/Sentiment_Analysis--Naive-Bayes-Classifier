To Maurice: I have been a fan of GH for a long time. You have brought a character to life, that is as interesting as Robert Scorpio. Please do not let your character become mundane! Your acting has only gotten better over the years at GH, I realize this protrayl is easy for you, because you draw on your own experiences to give Sonny his own personality. Don't forget people change and mature, Sonny needs to keep doing this to keep the audince attention. Reese, was a good counterpart to Sonny, I hope they keep the character. For all your work to bring Manic Depression to the forefront and the help you have given to so many, my congratulations, not everyone would be so forthcoming especially, in your position! Oh, about that green shirt, I presume they thought Ric was going to lose Sonny in the flood, otherwise, there would of been no reason to have woren it! It fit great though! BEST TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY A LOVING FAN, J.C PS. I can't resist saying something about those dimples, yaeh ,yeah, I know you've been these kind of things since your probably three, but , here's another one; your smile not only brightens the day, but, should be registered with the Nationl Defence as a lethal weapon, cause it is the most disarming thing I've ever seen! Okay I'm done now, enjoy! love J.
