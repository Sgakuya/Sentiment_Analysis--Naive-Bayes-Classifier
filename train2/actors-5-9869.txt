Sissy may not be beautiful to everyone, but I think she is. And not only is she gorgeous, but the woman can act like no other. She has had so many good roles, and she is really someone to look up to. I look forward to seeing her in many more movies in the future. Highly recommend Coal Miner's Daughter, and Carrie.
