I own a XD DV75, so called junk box worth nothing other than waste of money . It doesnt play even good cd's forget about even slight scratch on cd .It never played a VCD from start to end . I changed 2 lenses in 2 years and its shameful on this company's part ,and the lense kit costs as much as 2 small good branded DVD players !! Act smart do think twice before going for KENWOOD.
