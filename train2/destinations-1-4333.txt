LA is simply a horrible city. You have rude people, and there seems to trash everywhere on the streets! Traffic is a problem and so is the smog. In fact there's medical studies now that claim that smog has dire effects on your lung capacity and reproduction. Gang bangers at every locale and many apts in town are expensive.
