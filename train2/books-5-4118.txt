A simply written, quick read, that carries resounding moral implications. Vonnegut is able to highlight the idiocies and atrocities of war in such a way, that it makes the reader question how the worlds' governments could be so shortsighted, amoral, and stupid to continue to let war happen. Beneath the ridiculous characters and bizarre plot, Vonnegut tells the story one of the worst massacres in modern history - the bombing of civilian Dresden by the US army in World War II. Because there is no possible, logical explanation to support the destruction of Dresden, Vonnegut creates the alien world of Trafalmador, in which everything is pre-destined and time is irrelevant. In such a world, atrocities such as Dresden are not as bad, as you will always be able to choose to exist in your happy moments, and ignore the bad ones. As disturbing as it is hysterically funny, I could not recommend Slaughterhouse Five more strongly.
