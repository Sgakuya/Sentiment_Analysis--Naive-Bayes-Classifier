Kudos to Matthew Perry and his ability to keep his head up and be honest about his personal life. My brother suffers from a similar problem and he has been less than honest with our family. He still is. I, too, understand as I have been unwittingly been under the care of a doctor for back pain and when I read Matthew Perry's struggles, it made me stop, think and eventually change doctors. The weaning process was not easy and I had to find other means to deal with my pain, my embarassment, and my initial cravings. Keep at it Matthew! You are doing a great job professionally and personally. Despite what the stupid rag mags and other publications say -- This too shall pass! Remember, you have a gift and don't lose sight of that or let anything else get you down!
