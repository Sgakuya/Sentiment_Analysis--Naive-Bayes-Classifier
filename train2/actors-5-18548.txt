Even with my limited knowledge of film history, I recognize the genius of Orson Welles. If, before watching Citizen Kane, you watch a cross-section of movies made earlier, it becomes very clear that Welles introduced some remarkable cinematic innovations - different lighting techniques, ground-breaking editing, new types of shots. Welles may have been a stubborn, egotistical blowhard, but he had vision, and he wasn't going to let anyone mess it up.
