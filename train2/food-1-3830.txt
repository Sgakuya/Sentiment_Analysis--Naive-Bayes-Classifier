People that think Prego is good Italian sauce probably also think Pizza Hut is good pizza, Subway makes good sandwiches and According to Jim is sheer comic genius. We were invited over to dinner last night. The hostess makes noodles with Prego sauce. At first bite, the pungent and distasteful flavor and aroma of green peppers offends my olfaction. Even as I scraped every trace pf Prego off the pasta and doped it up with half a shaker of salt, that gross green pepper taste could not be overwhelmed. Fehhhh!!! That meal wasn't the worst part of the night. Having their 4-year-old son spit at me was the crowning moment of the night. For all you people that eat crappy Prego and Ragu sauce, all you need to do is take a few cans of Contadina Puree, mix in some olive oil, chopped garlic, salt, parmesan (or romano) cheese and oregano, and you'll be enjoying pasta like one of the Goodfellas.
