Gary Oldman is the BEST actor in Hollywood today. Period. He has never, ever given a bad performance. He is the master of dialect- he has changed his accent in practically ever movie that he has played in. He does not have that big a resume, but that is a testament to just how carefully he selects and prepares for his roles. Although he did not look much like Lee Harvey Oswald, his performance as Oswald in JFK was nonetheless breathtaking. The Scarlet Letter was an excellent movie as well. He shocked me in Air Force One by actually producing a great performance as a Russian terrorist who takes over the Presidential aircraft. Then, to top that off, he starred as a vindictive Congressman in The Contender . The places that this very talented actor can go are unlimited. I'd like to see him do more comedy- he was pretty good in The Fifth Element - and that southern accent he slapped on in there must've taken months to perfect. If only there were more actors like Gary Oldman around.
