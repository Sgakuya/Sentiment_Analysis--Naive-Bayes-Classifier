Great artists seek to reach for the stars and not just stand on the pavement. In so doing they often fail. Such is the case with Kubrick. He is responsible for some terrible stuff (most of which he acknowledges) but he is equally responsible for some of the finest films ever made. A lot like Welles, erratic at times, but a genius.
