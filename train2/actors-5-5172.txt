I watched his film Two Hands because I wanted to see him act in his Australian element. I was very impressed. In his interviews, he radiates a kind of light and he seems to be in touch with what is really important in life. That kind of attitude will carry him happily through life and career. I am excited to see what roles he chooses next.
