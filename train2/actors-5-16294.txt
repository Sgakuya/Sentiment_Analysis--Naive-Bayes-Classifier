I would not still be watching the show if it were not for Sonny . Maurice is mt FAVORITE character and I hope that he stays on GH for a long time. My mom and I look forward to seeing his character EVERY DAY! I would also like to have the # to the manic depressive help-line. I am currently in school to become a pharmasict, but I would love to continue to help people in the community as well!
