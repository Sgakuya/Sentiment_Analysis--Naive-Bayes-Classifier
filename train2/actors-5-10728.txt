The first time I saw Scarlett was in The Horse Whisperer and back then I could see her potential and I always said she would go far. The next time I saw her was in The Man who wasn't There she had progressed as an actress and it doesn't surprise me that shes been nominated for both a Golden Globe for Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring. Shes an amazing actress with a certain grace on screen and inner strength and I have no doubt in my mind she will win a major award some day.
