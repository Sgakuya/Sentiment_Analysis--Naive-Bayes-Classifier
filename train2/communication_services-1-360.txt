Cellular one is the worst service around. The employees could careless about their customers, the person you always have to talk to to get things changes just happens to always be out of the office and they are rude, rude, rude! I went in to get my phone fixed and the cell one employee said well i can sell you a new phone but you have to sign a contract. HA! All they care about is selling. They could careless about their customers. I don't reccomend this company unless you want to have heck with them every time you receieve your bill!
