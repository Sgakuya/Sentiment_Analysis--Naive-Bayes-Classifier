awful writing. Thw worst book I have read in years. She writes as though she had to rush the book to press. I took a red pen, marked up every time she uses the words or phrases long, got, a lot, it seemed to..., there was something, just, really , and the book looked like it had been in a war....all bloodied over with ink spots. TERRIBLE book.
