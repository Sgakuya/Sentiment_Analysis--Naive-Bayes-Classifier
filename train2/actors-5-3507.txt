Nicolas Cage is a very talented actor whos career I have followed with great satisfaction. As an actor, I admire him and his accomplishments, and as a man, I have very much respect for his devotion to his beautiful wife and his unbridled passionate love for his son. His talent and drive is was truely evident in not only the creation of a black orchid to win a womans heart, but also in all of the roles I have joyfully watched him portray. He is indeed an amazing man and deserves the highest of ratings
