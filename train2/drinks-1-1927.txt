Natty Light is nasty! The only reason anyone should ever drink this stuff is if they are already three sheets to the wind and therefore have already lost their sense of taste...or if you are on an extremely tight budget and need to get trashed. I drank this stuff in college when I was poor. But now that I graduated, there is no reason for me to ever touch Natty Light again.
