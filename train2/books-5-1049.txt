These books win awards for good reason. My daughter and I recently met Mr. Peck. If you ever get a chance, go to his book signings!! What a wonderful, hilarious man. He truly relates to these older children; giving them just what they want to read. His books have humor, surprise, adventure, and plenty to talk about. Buy them ALL! These books will be just as entertaining to my grandchildren- timeless:)
