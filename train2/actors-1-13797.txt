she is a one trick pony. All she can do is flash that shark tooth grin of hers. This woman has no talent and is ugly as sin. How she beat out Ellen burstyn for a oscar in that made for sunday night movie Erin brockovich is beyond me. Ellen preformance in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM outstanding. Ellen is the best living actor today.
