Wachovia is definitely the WORST!! They are nothing more then Federally approved LOAN SHARKS, the only thing they don't do is come out and break your legs if you owe them fees. They not only will charge you $30.00 for an overdraft they will also tact on additional $30.00 for insufficient funds if it is a debit/credit card purchase. With NSF fee totally $60.00 for one item, even if you were short $0.90. I was with them wayyyy tooo long. I stopped all of my automatic deposits into their account and opened up a new account elsewhere. Yes their NSF fees are very predatory! The check cashing places will give you a better rate then they will. They just sucks all the way around. They are the absolutely worst of the worst, the lowest of the low. I rather take my chances with my money in my back pocket then to deal with them. They have no loyalty to you whatsoever, they do not care how long you have had an account with them. The customer service person will tell you quicker than you can blink your eye that any NSF fees are processed by a computer and they have nothing to do with it. Leave these vultures alone, they will steal and rob from hard working people through their NSF policy.
