I can't stand her character Ally McBeal. Or the show for that matter. If she could keep her hands off her face or her fingers out of her mouth for five mintues it would be an improvement.Some vitamins may help that head of hair, or lack there of. Oh well, doesn't matter, I'll never watch the stupid show anyway.
