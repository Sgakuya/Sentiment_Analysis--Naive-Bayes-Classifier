I love this man!!!!! He can act and is very handsome! He is incredibly talented in all of his movies (and I have seen them all!). I would give anything to meet a man this talented. The way that he can go from a nerdy guy (People vs Larry Flint) to a kick ass skin head (American History X) is incredible. And how he can play to people at once and keep you wondering is so amazing. Like I said once, I love this man!!!!!
