Jeez, that voice. Almost as irritating as Goldie Hawn. Her only saving grace is that she hasn't made as many films. What she has done generally suck. No where near attractive enough to deserve 'love interest' or top billing. Major minus for the philosophically execrable 'Working Girl' the worst of the 1980s craze for 'me me me' films.
