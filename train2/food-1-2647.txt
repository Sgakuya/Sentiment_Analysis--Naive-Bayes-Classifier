Hershey's chocolate is the most disgusting, cheap, waxy excuse of a candy bar I have ever tasted. The texture is waxy and grainy. The taste is flat and unpleasing. Give me European chocolate any day over this sad excuse for chocolate. The only thing that Hershey bars are actually any good in are Smores. Other than that...no thanks.
