I moved here from ct. 5 months ago, can't find work in my field all the mexicans have them and will work for peanuts.property is going through the roof,gas is as expensive as anywhere.roads are terrible,people are very unfriendly,summers are too hot.my wife had to drive an hour to work 12 hrs. and get home at 8:00p.m. 6 days aweek. they work you like a slave here!I don't see how people can afford a house making $8.00 to 10.00 bucks an hour. this place is an outrage, as much as I hate snow, theres no place like home and the new england patriots!
