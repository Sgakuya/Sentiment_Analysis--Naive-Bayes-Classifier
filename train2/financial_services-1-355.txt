Bank One is THE worst! I had a check to cash and they wanted to charge me 3 bucks because I didn't have an account there-- my local bank does not do this to people who don't have an account with them. Plus, my local bank is courteous, competent, convenient, open late, and offers free checking. Bank one tellers are always trying to sell me on something...NOT interested!!!
