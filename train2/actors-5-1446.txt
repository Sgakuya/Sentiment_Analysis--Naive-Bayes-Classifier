Jack Nicholson is the best actor ever to grace the silver screen. He has never been type-cast, because he has never been afraid to take chances and make films that may not appeal to the masses. He makes no appologies for his acting career or personal life. What you see is what you get. The world would be a place if more people were true to themselves like Jack. Thank you Mr. Nicholson for being true to your craft as an actor, and director.
