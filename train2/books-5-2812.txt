Five years ago, I wouldn't have read a history book if you paid me. Now - for whatever reason - I get more excited about a book that describes the building of the transcontinental railroad than I do about a good novel. I've read a lot of Ambrose books, and one thing that characterizes his work is a contagious enthusiasm for his subject. This book is no different. Ambrose really makes you understand how exciting it was for the country to conceive of and build a railroad that connected the two coasts and helped bind the union from the east to the west (right after the Civil War ensured that the union would be bound from the north to the south). Nothing Like It in the World really gives you a sense of the magnitude of the accomplishment and the impact it had on the United States. So many descriptions in this book stand out in my mind - the Hell on Wheels towns that sprung up at the head of the Union Pacific line, the Chinese workers using black powder and nitroglycerine to blast through the Sierras (while sometimes living for months under the snow) on the Central Pacific line, the financial maneuvering of the two railroad companies as they manipulated the government and public opinion to get their way... Recently I drove from San Francisco to Lake Tahoe and saw first-hand the Central Pacific weaving its way though the Sierras. Thanks to Ambrose I could imagine what it was like to survey the route for the line, blast tunnels inches at a time, grade the track, and lay down the rail across those mountains.
