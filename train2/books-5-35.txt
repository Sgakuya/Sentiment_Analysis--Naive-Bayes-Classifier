this book was very sad it was very intriguing to read how dave had come from being a very badly abused child to becoming very successfull in everything he done. and for this he has gone to show just because you were abused as a child doesnt mean you hae to go on in life thinking you are always going to be abused because if you have the strength and determination you can get out of it just like dave did id recommend this book to everyone so they can see how david suffered in the hands of his own mother which is disgusting i wish you all luck!!!
