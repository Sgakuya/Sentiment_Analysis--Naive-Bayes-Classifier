Crappy! the city is dirty and you get ripped off at every turn! the people are unfriendly and none know any english. i met 1 girl who spoke english! ONE! what do they learn in school? the sites are far and few between. it took a days walking to to get to 4 sites. most real cities have sites all around but here its a trek to the next one. i'd say go if its on the way to the next stop, BUT dont bother making a special trip like i did. I even got ripped off at the train station ticket counter! just plain crappy
