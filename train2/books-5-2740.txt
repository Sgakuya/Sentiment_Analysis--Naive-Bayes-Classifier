This book changed my life! Robbins' compassionate writing explains why the Vegan diet is not only good for your body, but good for the planet and the welfare of all life. Society conditions us to a certain attitude and in most parts of the world our meat eating habits are drastically increasing risk of diet related disease, heart attacks, osteoporosis, obesity, etc. This book not only educates one to the horrid and inhumane treatment of animals raised for food (you'll be shocked) but also shows how to change your diet to a natural and cruelty free diet and add years to your life. Even if you have no intention of being vegetarian this book could inform you and let you see where vegetarians are coming from. Do yourself (not to mention the whole world) a favor and read this book.
