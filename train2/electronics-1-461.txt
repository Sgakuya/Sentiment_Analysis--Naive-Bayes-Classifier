I would like to state that Tivo's customer service SUCKS! I have never encountered a supervisor who was more rude. I have cancelled my service. I used to rave to people about Tivo and now I make sure that I tell everyone I know NOT to purchase Tivo. My husband said he had cancelled service because our box had broken. I discovered 2 months later that we were still being charged for service. When I called I was told that without a cancellation number I would not be refunded the two months worth of charges. I asked to speak to a supervisor who said the same thing. I asked why can't you check my account. You can see that I have not logged on in over two months. She said that Tivo does not have the TIME or the MONEY to check every single persons account! That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Not to mention her extremely rude and snotty attitude! She was talking and I started to respond to what she was saying and she yelled DON'T YOU INTERRUPT ME WHEN I AM SPEAKING! What kind of customer service is that? I was upset but I was not yelling or rude and even if I was anyone in customer service nows that you grin and bear it because its your job! I own Tivo and Replay. They both have features different from each other. If they could be combined you would have the perfect system. If you have to choose I would say Replay is the better way to go! Jeanne Coffey Naperville, IL
