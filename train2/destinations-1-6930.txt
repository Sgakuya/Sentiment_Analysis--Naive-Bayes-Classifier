Family responsibilities forced me to spend a week in Mississippi last October, and it was the worst week of my life - notwithstanding the generally fine weather and attractive scenery. Perhaps the colleagues, friends, acquaintances, and neighbors of my relatives are not typical of Mississipians - I certainly hope they aren't, because the local folk I met were the most judgmental, bigoted, mean-spirited, nasty, and generally hateful bunch of born-again Christians I've ever run into. I was never happier than when I was able to return home to Kansas where a more live- -let-live attitude prevails.
