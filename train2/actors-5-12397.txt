I really like her. She's a very underappreciated actress, who unfortunately does not get a lot of good parts. I think she was at her best in Fried Green Tomatoes , and her show, Kate Brasher at 9:00 pm saturdays on CBS (cough ADVERTISEMENT cough) is not that bad. Give it a chance, at least. She deserves that much
