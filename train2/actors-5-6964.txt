I love Ethan Hawke alot, I mean not just for his looks altought he is the hottest guy in the world. But because I feel I can relate to him in so many ways. And besides that he is a very good actor, I wish he would do about 10 more movies,because he makes all of his work so beliveable, and anyone who ever said that he is not a great actor is wrong, the only thing I don't get is him and Uma. Me and my friends think they will get divorced by nexted year. But I love Ethan, and I don't say that hardly to anyone, he is that special, I think about him all the time.
