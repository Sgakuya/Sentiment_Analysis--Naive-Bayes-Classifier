Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time. He has gone to sleep and awakened to find his story unrated and underappreciated. He has walked through a door in 2000 and come out another is 1944 to begin it all again. He is spastic in time and has seen his birth and death dozens of times. And so on... Fantastic book! I've read this one dozens of times. It's one of those books that because every part is so good and it leaps forwards and backwards so often that you can just pick it up and start on any page and just read. If you haven't read this you're missing out. Thanks operator, thanks just the same...
