Here is one actor who as always given me the willies. And his escapades outside of the acting arena has rather confirmed my intuition. I will never understand all this great actor stuff. Al Pacino has it all over this guy. When he played the psycho out to kill Jodie Foster, I can see why he could be typecast for such roles...just seems very seedy, skeevy, you know those words kind of cover it.
