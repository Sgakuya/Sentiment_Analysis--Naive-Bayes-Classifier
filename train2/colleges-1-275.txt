University of Hooked on Phonics, what a joke. I remember someone in the office asked this girl where she went to school and she said U o P. He said, University of the Pacific? Good school. No, she sheepishly interrupted, University of Phoenix. The person just said Oh, rolled their eyes and walked off. Don't go to school here if you can avoid it, it's a lame ripoff and totally laughable. Net value = 0.
