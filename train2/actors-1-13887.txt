Julia fancies herself a political pundit calling our president a moron and asserting that he isn't the rightful winner of the election. She should keep her ugly mouth shut and leave the political analysis to those who know what they are talking about. What a moron. Not a very good actress either. Not that I will be going to any of her movies in the future. My advice to you julia? Get out of America; we don't need you.
