I can't believe the people who immedialty mis-judge judge this strip's genius solely on the fact that it isn't the best drawn comic in he papers. News-Flash, Dilbert is not a well drawn strip! We all read it due to it's content and HOW WE CAN ALL RELATE TO IT! That is what makes Foxtrot so memoriable; it's relation with the reader. I suggest that any new or old comic reader go to www.foxtrot.com and read up on foxtrot. Do not diss this strip because it is one of the best strips out and that have ever graced our comics page. Jason, Paige, Peter, Andy, Roger and Quincy; how could I ever forget them?
