My second favorite actor, behind Cate Blanchett. She's even more remarkable when you consider her career arc. Former Victoria's Secret model (I can see the eye rolling now) she first gained notioriety playing a Bond girl, thus making her an even more unlikely candidate for stardom. Nevertheless, she persisted, honing her skills alternately in big budget shlock (Deep Rising, House on Haunted Hill) and indies (City of Industry, Love and Sex). Eventually, her persistance paid off when she was noticed by such lofty types as Robert Altman and Woody Allen.She gained a reputation as a sexy scenery chewer who stole any movie she was in, regardless of how big the role. Now, she triumphs as Jean Grey in the Magnificent X2. She has nowhere to go but up. As someone who has been a fan for nearly a decade, I must say this success couldn't have happened to a more deserving person.
