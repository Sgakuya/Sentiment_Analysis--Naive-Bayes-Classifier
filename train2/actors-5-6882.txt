Arnold is truly a GIANT of the industry. Starting as a body builder who did bit parts that he was cast in just because of his size, to filming some of the top box office takes ever! He makes action films. If you don't like action films then you should't watch them go watch Victor Victoria and put a cork in it. He is good at what he does and thats produce action! Remember his first language is not English so the accent isn't that bad really, How do you sound when speaking dutch?
