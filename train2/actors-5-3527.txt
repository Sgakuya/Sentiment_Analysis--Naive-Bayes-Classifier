Nicholas Cage is so totally awesome...I have watched him from his very first movie Valley Girl , through City of Angels and you can bet that I will be first in line to see his latest The Family Man ..He always plays his roles to the best of his abilities..which are completely incredible...gorgeous and stunning..
