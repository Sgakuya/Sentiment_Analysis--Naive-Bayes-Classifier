Robert, What you need is someone to stand behind you 100% to let you know that it's ok to do the things you are doing, just as long you understand the consequences! Man, no one deserves to go to jail for a chronic drug use. Obviously it's not the answer! You made some relatively poor choices in life, but that's no reason to condemn you! I stand behind you all the way, and if you need more people like myself to give you support, man just find the light! Drug abuse is something we all understand, and some of us more than others, but I tell you If there's anybody listening, Robert your story is the one that's making folks realize that it's real, and you are real along with the choices you make concerning your life and your career! Please everybody, before judgement is passed, make sure you understand the addiction! And if you think that it is just the drugs, then you are sadly mistaken! Read more, and study the foundation of the problems. And in closing, it really has me dumb-founded to imagine that not a single psychologist, or close friend hasn't pin pointed the root of the problem! If anybody wants the truth, take a deeper look into Robert's eyes, and come up with healthy things to say, rather than trying to kick a man while he's down! Because by gholly he will get up, and then what? Keep The Faith Robert!!! In Vitro, Vampire Eyes Vampire Eyes --- twingreenecho@earthlink.net The Blood Co., Inc.
