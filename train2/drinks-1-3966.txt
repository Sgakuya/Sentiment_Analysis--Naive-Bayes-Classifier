For shame that Procter and Gamble listed their juice as 5% pure juice! This doesn't come close to Donald Duck Orange Juice. Just too much technology and sugar put into it- nothing can replace the true taste of oranges. I drank one when it was stale, and it made me throw up. Totally not delightful under the sun!
