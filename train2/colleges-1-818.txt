I hired an employee who was "earning" a Masters degree from the University of Phoenix. This person was incapable of writing a coherent sentence or of displaying basic analytical skills. Yet I would hear this person gleefully talking about the latest A she earned in her Phoenix course work. If this is the academic rigor required by this for-profit school then they are producing a product from an apparent diploma mill. I will never again hire someone who claims to have a degree from the University of Phoenix.
