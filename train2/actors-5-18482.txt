One of the most talented and prolific movie directors of our time - who obviously has the Midas Touch to a degree most directors have only dreamed of having. It would be an understatement to say that the silver screen would have been much dimmer and duller over the past 25 years had it not been for the input and undeniable talents of Mr. Spielberg. ET, The Color Purple, Jurassic Park, Jaws, Schindler s List, Close Encounters, Poltergeist - the list goes on and on and reads like a two semester study in cinema classics. The fact that he was actually turned down both times he applied to film school should be an inspiration to anyone who has ever had an unrealized dream. His work to help Holocaust victims reunite with their families reveals the perceptive humanitarian behind this gifted filmmaker. The fact that he considers Warner Brothers One Froggy Evening (starring Michigan J. Frog) to be the best animated cartoon ever produced gives us a bit more insight into the youthful sense of humor, excellent taste, and ability to spot a true classic that has no doubt influenced his own selection of films. I have been one of his most avid fans since the 70 s and I don t have to use much of my own imagination to believe that I will continue to be gleefully entertained by his movies for many years to come.
