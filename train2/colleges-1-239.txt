Totally overrated. Graduates come out as Management Science robots. In the early 1990's Rice MBAs had to take several of their courses at the University of Houston. I don't know if this has changed or if there has been improvement, but if you are going to spend this kind of money I'd go to a real Ivy League. Besides Houston looks as though it was hit with an ugly stick!
