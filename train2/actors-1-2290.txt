Don't hate me, but I think that Mel Gibson is a terrible actor. Not convincing at all. I remember watching the Patriot and he was trying to be all sad and cried.....I felt nothing. And that is how I feel about him in pretty much every movie. He does not convince me at all. And now I am already avoiding movies with him, cause I know I wouldn't like it.
