T-Mobile customer service does suck. after being with T-Mobile for over four years. I had my phone stolen. They told me they would credit the account. part was credited. when I called back and asked why only part of the bill was credited. Customer service told me I was lucky that any part of the bill was credited. And I must pay the rest. All they care is about the bottom line. I can't wait for my contract to expire.
