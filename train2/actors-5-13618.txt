Thought she was another cute face without talent. Boy was I surprized. I watch Friends because I love Lisa Kudrows character. Jennifer showed me she can act with the best of them and has risen high on my must see list for movies and television shows. I was blessed to play a small part in the movie Office Space with Jennifer Aniston where I also found out that she has a great work ethic, a very down to earth manner and doesn't waste time purposefully messing up to create out takes and bloopers. Not my favorite actress but she is in the top 20.
