She is so underrated. She's a classic, and not some one hit wonder that Hollywood seems to be throwing out in our faces, like Angelina Jolie, or some other untalented slob. She's just very cool and very mysterious. I would love to see her in more films. Not to mention the fact that she's just so sexy, and so unique.
