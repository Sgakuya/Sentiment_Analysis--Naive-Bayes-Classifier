i don't know what some of you are talking about but joe is a great actor. i mean yes he is great looking but there is more to him than that. i have seen at least ten of his movies within the last month and he has got so much talent it's unbelieveable. he can be funny and charming like in his shakespearean movies or even in martha.... but he can also be mysterious and a little out of it like in killing me softly. my point is he is an excenllent actor and should be noticed for it, not just for his looks. (by the way is he currently dating someone?)
