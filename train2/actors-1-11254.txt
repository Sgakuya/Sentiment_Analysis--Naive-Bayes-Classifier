Kirsten Dunst is just plain annoying. She is totally overrated. She looks more like a piglet than a starlet. She is not very pretty or very talented. Her smile is really put on and her movies are almost always stupid. Drop Gorgeous is a horribly stupid idiotic excuse for a film. How lame can movies get? She has also taken sexually implied pictures with a cat that I found totally offensive, not to mention how vain she is in interviews. I don't know how anybody in their right mind could even say that she is the best young actress in Hollywood. COME ON! It's sad that we don't have much of the kind of classy talent as Audrey Hepburn in Hollywood these days. Hopefully we will see less of Kirsten rather than more in the years to come.
