It triggers emotions of people who aren't American, too -- it's a great book. Steinbeck is a social critic and an artist at the same time, which is rare. He makes you feel for his characters and their plight without making noble savages of them -- they're real people, flawed, and that only makes their suffering more real. Grapes of Wrath is a hard book to read, but it'll thaw your soul.
