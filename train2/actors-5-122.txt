I have not seen too many of Humphrey Bogarts movies.He was great in The African Queen and won a much deserved oscar.I think that this was my favorite Bogart movie.He was also great in the The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.He is a very convincing actor. The only movie I have seen that I did not like to see him in was Sabrina. I got the feeling that he felt uncomfortable in this movie.
