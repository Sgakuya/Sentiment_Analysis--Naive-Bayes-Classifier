I loved what he had to say at the Oscars while all the other frightened wimps at the ceremony sat mute and scared. I had never seen any of his work but as a result of his ability to tell the truth at that ceremony I went to see Bowling for Columbine and loved it, even though I am a supporter of the NRA! I don't HAVE to agree with everything he has to say but since I am not afraid of a person not having my exact opinions I could enjoy it and look forward to his next documentary. I noticed lots of opinions about his appearance and excess weight. Frankly, I thought his physical appearance was no worse than that Hollywood crowd, aerobicized, plasticized, botoxed within an inch of their lives. Has the right wing forgotten how fat one of their holy men , namely Russ Limbaugh used to be. Incidentally, the people in Washington who screamed the loudest that we should support our troops just voted to cut medical benefits for our veterans.
