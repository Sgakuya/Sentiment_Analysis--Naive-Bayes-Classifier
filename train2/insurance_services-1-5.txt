I was a Amica policyholder for 10 years without a claim (Auto & Homeowners), and my auto rates were raised for late payments. The late payments occured over three years (one late payment each year) one was three days late, second was due to the Anthrax attack at my local PO (Trenton, NJ) and the third was 4 days late. I called and asked them to reconsider due to me being such a good customer. I was refused by a CSR, Manager and General Manager. I now have a new insurance company with better rates. Buyer beware!!!
