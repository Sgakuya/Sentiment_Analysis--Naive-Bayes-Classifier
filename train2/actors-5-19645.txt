Michael Richards is a comic genius. Just seeing him makes me start to laugh. His portrayal of Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld is one of the funniest I have ever seen on television. The bizarre way Richards uses his body, props, and the space around him makes his work memorable. Richards has a new sitcom coming out this fall ( The Michael Richards Show on NBC), and I have high hopes for it.
