I like her. Like Josh Hartnett, she's one of the up-and-coming twenty-something actresses who has done a lot of work geared towards her generation yet has shown she can play a variety of more mature roles. She also has star-qualities - pretty, but not too pretty yet still attractive, tall with a pleasant voice that allows for a range of acting talent. She has a look that can be used in a wide range of roles and in all different movie genres.
