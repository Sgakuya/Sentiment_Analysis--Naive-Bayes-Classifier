Big, fat, disgusting, unshaven, loud-mouthed, flatulent, diseased, communistic, ugly hat-wearing lump of detritus. And them be's his good points. The sad irony of it all is that the more we rant against Moore, the more people clamor to see Fahrenheit 911 [Two notes on the title: 1) Moore ripped the title from Ray Bradbury without even consulting him. Bradbury is outraged. 2) 911 is obvilusly Moore's weight in kilograms]. The controversy aspect never fails. The same thing happened with Passion of Christ (controversy = $370M and counting) and even an oldie but goodie from year's ago -- Deep Throat (was not grossing until the moral majority wanted it banned and it ended up being the most profitable movie in history). So I guess if we want to stop Michael Moore, we should all collectively keep our pie holes shut with regards to Moore.
