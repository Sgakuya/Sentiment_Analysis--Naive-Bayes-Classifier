Matthew my sweet Matthew, what a beautiful, intelligent, and thoughtful person he seems to be. I just saw him on Letterman tonight and he was so cool, and so laid back. He talked about a road trip with one of his buddies, and a crazy emu that attacked his brother on his ranch in Texas. I love this guy....and we all know he is friendly with Miss MaryJane, he's got to be :o) I could see myself kickin back and drinkin a couple beers with this guy, (in my dreams too) Oh and what a good little thesbian, i think a lot of actors can learn something from him. Okay...bedtime... Sarah
