I just had to post here. DeVry is all about the money, and could care less about it's students. The teachers? I think there are still a few left that actually care, but for the most part, the less you bother them, the better they like it. I wouldn't even know where to being. So, I'll just make a list. 1. Administration is suffering from major disconnect. I have had serious issues, and no one ever seems to know what is going on. So I have to re-explain the situation every time. The SA (student advisor) and FA (Financial Aid Advisor) made promises they couldn't keep, and left. I have been with DeVry for 1 year and 3 months, and I have had 3 different SA's so far and never even knew my FA quit until I got slapped with a 3K bill. (which they require 4 equal monthly payments of....does anyone have $750.00 to spare?) Also, the instructors? Less than half are knowledgable, the other half can't find teh sepll chek! What's up with that??? Oh, and the tuition....close to 500.00 per credit hour? For that? I think not. They're high. The administrative staff is a joke, the classes are way behind. I do online classes so I really have no idea what the Computer Lab is like. So,..no complaints there! I just want everyone to really research DeVry before signing anything. It's such a scam. You may as well buy your degree from a diploma mill. It's cheaper.
