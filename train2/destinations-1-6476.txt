This state is a nightmare and full of hatred and racism. The blacks hate the white. The white's hate the black's. The inner workings of New Orleans, what's left of it, is poverty stricken, which breeds more hatred from the wealthy who live in the outerlying areas. The Katrina tragedy only heightened the annimosity and brought out the worst in people instead of their best, and no amount of good crawfish can make up for the foul taste of this miserable brand of prejudice.
