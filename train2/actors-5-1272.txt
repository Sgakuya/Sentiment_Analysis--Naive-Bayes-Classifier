Possibly the greatest actor of his generation. Very convincing when a part demands a stretch and charming/capable when he assumes a more typical role. His performances in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Cape Fear were positively rivetting, and he displyed quite a gift for comedy in Analyze This, Meet the Parents, and Brazil. Usually a good judge of scripts but will take a role in a so-so film just to get his face out to the public or to reach an audience that otherwise wouldn't go out to see one of his typical films. I've met him and thought he was a genuinely nice guy who didn't put on airs, yet kept a safe, respectful distance.
