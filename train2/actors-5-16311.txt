Maurice Benard is my all time favorite actor favorite character on GH-just love him Sonny Corinthos.I've watched him when he first started GH over 8 years ago. He is truly the Best Daytime Actor that I have seen,absoluetly wonderful.Maurice has found the Best partner Leading Lady that he can ever asked for-and her name is Tamara Braun. They just click everytime,I seen them on my screen,these two just shine together and the chemistry is unbelieveable.It seems these two have been acting together for years,it's just truly amazing.
