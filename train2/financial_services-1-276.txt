I just parted ways with Wachovia and I couldnt be happier. Ive never seen a company more ethically challenged and morally bankrupt than the likes of this one. All I wanted was a checking account that allowed me access to money that was readily available. Not a penny more not a penny less. My past experience has been that a bank will not let you spend beyond what you have in your account. Now for those of you that havent had the misfortune of dealing with Wachovia, they let you go nine hundred dollars in the hole before you even see a glimpse of a red flag. They call it an emergency cushion. I call it criminal. If I wanted a nine hundred financial noose with which to hang myself I wouldve called a high interest credit card company. Whats in my wallet? lint. Thanks Wachovia.
