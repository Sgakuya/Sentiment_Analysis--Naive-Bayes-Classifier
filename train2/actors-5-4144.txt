One of the most talented and underrated actors in Hollywood. Long career spanning 3 decades. His acting debut was 1975 in Cornbread Earl and Me. My favorite rolls, Ike Turner in What's Love Got to Do With It and my all time favorite, his roll as Socrates Fortlow in Always Outnumbered. Definately one of the best of the current actors.
