I love classic literature. I read Great Expectations in my freshman AP English class and completely fell in love with it. It's one of the few classics I can recall that doesn't end happily. The relation the reader develops with Pip engrenders an affection that leads them to sympathize for Pip and hurt at the knowledge of how his trials end him up.
