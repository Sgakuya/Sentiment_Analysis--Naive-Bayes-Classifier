I am reporting them to the Securities Comm. Lost Over $2000. in 3 months. I am having a big run-arund trying to obtain a close out of my accounts. Sent proper forms etc. They will also be rported to the BBB. False promises and noted harrassment-prior to my error in judgement. They scamed me into thinking they had the rights to my account.
