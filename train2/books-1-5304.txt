This is a book filled with ridiculos feminist sentimnet and nonsensical rubbish. Even the title is unimaginative 'the lovely bones' absoloutely half assed titling. My god I wonder how it came to be a bestseller? I really wish people would stop reccomending me books because I am a teenager or because they are best sellers.This boobk is overly long and filled with sentimental trash its these books that have lead to the demise of the even half decent bookstore many of which are now being turnes into faux mediteraenean cafes to which female office workers can sit and read it after having bought it in their local supermarket. My god I wish I had not bought it what a load of rubbish FORGET IT i WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE IT NO STARS
