I've been studying everything I could find about Lucy since the first time I saw I Love Lucy (I was about 4 then. I am 16 now.) She is truly one of the greatest actresses ever on TV. Not only in I Love Lucy, but also in other shows and her many movies. Her personal story behind the TV's Lucy is also worth knowing. She was incredible...a great inspiration.
