Spanky was very adorable when he was the toddler tag-along. There was one short in which the Gang dupes four-year-old Spanky into baby-sitting their younger brothers and sisters. It was cool the way Spanky (a baby himself) handled everything... making sure the rambunctious tots stayed put by imprisoning them in individual cages! Spanky caught on quite quickly over the years, and started picking up a lot of Oliver Hardy's actions (with emphasis on the glare and the exasperated look), along with many other rules of old-time comedy, and mastered them quite well. They were really brought out in him by the time he became the Gang leader, with Alfalfa as his best friend/apprentice, and young Buckwheat and Porky along for the ride. I believe this is about the time that Spanky was at his peak -- when he was about 8 years old. Spanky is my favorite Rascal, and I consider him to be one of the best '30s/'40s child stars, not too far under Shirley Temple.
