Sally Field is a great actress. I grew up with her watching Gidget, The Flying Nun, Smoky and the Bandit, Sybil, my favorite role i think is, Eye for an Eye, It really makes you think about how far someone can push you, when it comes to hurting your children. She was fantastic!!! Thank you Sally !! for all the great movies. Loretta Keesee Piketon, Ohio
