Crowded, noisy 24 hours a day, unbelievable crime, dirty, few people have cars but the traffic is horrendous, the heat and humidity are unreal, a true 3rd world hellhole. Be lucky we have the sewage systems in America, because they are non-existent here. If you like rats, you'll like Lagos. Unfortunately a sign of the future for our overpopulated world.
