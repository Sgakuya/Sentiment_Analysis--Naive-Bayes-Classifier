Liev Schreiber is seriously underrated for all the roles he's able to play. He can play an average/intelligent joe (Sphere), he can play a creepy villain (Phantoms), a bad-guy that you feel sympathy for (Ransom), a disturbed man being controlled (Manchurian Candidate), and besides that, he can effectively play Shakespearan roles such as Hamlet, amongst many other characters. He deserves so many starring roles. I will keep my eye on him because I know talent when I see it. He literally pulls me into every movie I watch. An amazing actor.
