John Travolta is the best of best! He is an incredibly tallented actor, who, I might add, was indeed incredibly good lookin, especially in Grease. He still is good-looking. I've been his fan for a while now and I really can say that he is really amazing. He is also an amazing singer. PLUS he can play ANY role. He can be funny, sad, serious, romantic, stupid, intelligent, and this list could go on for a while! If I found out that I have a chance to meet him, I don't know what I would do...I'd prolly jump over the moon ;). Really, this is one person who I admire so much and really want to meet. Hes really definately the greatest!
