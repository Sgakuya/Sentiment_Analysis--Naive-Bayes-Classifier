I really hate you ignorant peices of crap fools that rated him a two or below. What the hell? He is the greatest actor ever! Alex P. Keaton, Marty McFly, Brantley Foster! He great. Nothing about him in anyway is below a five. For those that say he doesn't have that disease, I'd like to see you put fifty millions dollars towards research for a cure to a disease you don't have...oh wait a minute! You probably don't have a million dollars because you aren't worth it, like he IS. Too bad you don't realize that great acting aura he presents us all with.
