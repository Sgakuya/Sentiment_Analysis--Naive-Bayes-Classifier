I bought this book, mainly because a few years back I'd seen the movie and thought it would be fun to see how alike they were. The first challange happened when I started to read the first page, I hadn't expected it to be written in the Scottish accent. It took me around 2-3 chapters before I could understand all the spelling completely. But once I got that clear... wow. This book is brilliant, and one of the most enjoyable directions that the movie can't make is the deeper look into each of the characters. Another enjoyable part is all the sidestories that take place, some of which were quite chilly. This book is a perfect example of why you shouldn't get hooked on drugs, if it's true to real life or not it certainly has a deterrent effect on you.
