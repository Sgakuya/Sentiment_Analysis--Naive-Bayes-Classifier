 The Cat In the Hat was a classic, and its follow-up ( The Cat in the Hat Comes Back ) was fair. But Dr. Seuss should have stopped there. His books quickly became pitiful and each one seemed worse than the one that came out before it. [yes, I posted this some time ago, but the guy who gave it 13 not helpfuls has been lax in his duties lately, so I'm putting this up again to give him some more exercise - hop to it, Fido!]
