This whole series is fantastic! I liked each and every one of the five books and didn't want the story to end. The characters in each book are well written and mesh well from book to book. Since I commented originally, I have re-read the books and am even more impressed. Susan Cooper managed to weave elements of the Arthurian legend through the classic battle of Light and Darkness, with original plots and imaginative sequences, resulting in a 5-book tale that offers more depth than many children's books.
