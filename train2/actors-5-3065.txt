What is m'man Crowe doing all the way down here?Word is he's an ass****, but as an actor, he's got about five masks, which is exceptional in my book. The guy is probably the most versatile actor we have right now. So, I ask again, what's he doing down here? He's gotta be better than that worm Norton?
