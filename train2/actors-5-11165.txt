Before last year, I wouldn't have given Nicole Kidman a second thought. Didn't know what I was missing out on. Two amazing performances in equally amazing films later, (Moulin Rouge, The Others) I'm a rabid fan. It still astounds me that ol' Tommy would leave her for a talentless Spanish bird, though it sure looks like she's getting along just dandy without him. This classy lady deserves all the best. -Jez
