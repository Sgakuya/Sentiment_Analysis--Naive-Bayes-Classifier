Mel is a talented, moral man. I appreciate hearing his conservative views... such a change from the run of the mill liberal Hollywood views expressed every time I flip the TV on. He's a breath of fresh air, and I really enjoy watching his movies. Oh, one more thing... he's gorgeous... lol. Can't forget that.
