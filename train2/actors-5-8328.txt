Vivien Leigh was one of the most talented actresses. The role of Scarlett was hers alone, I have watched the screen tests of other actresses and clearly, Vivien was the best. Her Academy Awards for Gone With The Wind and Streetcar Named Desire were well deserved. Her scenes in Streetcar are heartbreaking.
