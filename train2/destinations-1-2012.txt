I used to admire Allende (see my comments on Allende), but upon realizing that socialism and hand-outs are not the way to develop self-reliance and a sense of self-worth, I really can't give this country higher than one star, based upon politics. Their support of NAFTA is OK, but since I really am suspect of unions in general I can't generate too much enthusiasm for a nation's namesake that reminds me of a spicy food.
