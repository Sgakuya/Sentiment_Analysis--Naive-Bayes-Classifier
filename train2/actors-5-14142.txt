Gorgeous actress of immense talent and a savvy nose for good roles. Discovered by director Larry Clark while sitting on the stoop of her Brooklyn apartment in 1996, she has become one of the most ubiquitous young actors of the recent decade. Her exotic multi-cultural looks help defy typecasting while her charisma keeps people interested. She occasionally serves little more than eye-candy, but her dramatic turns in Spike Lee's the 25th Hour and Ethan Hawke's Chelsea Walls prove her to be a talent to be reckoned with. Not to mention the fact that she has one of the best all-natural bodies in the business.
