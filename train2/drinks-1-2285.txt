Very often in the case of bottled water, it is argued that you can't tell the difference (regarding taste) between one brand from the other. But Aquafina proves this to be wrong. This brand lacks so much quality that its' taste is similar to that of cardboard. Their so-called purification process is most likely nothing more than taking sewage water and throwing in some chemcials. What's that called again? Oh yeah, reverse osmosis (lol).
