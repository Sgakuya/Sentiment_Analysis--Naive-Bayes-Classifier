I posted the comments below in quotes nearly 5 years ago. Seems that I was 100% correct. WHERE IS BALDWIN'S CAREER NOW? Alec's opinions are very interesting indeed! He refuses to eat goose liver pate because the geese are mistreated but at the same time favors partial birth abortion, a procedure that includes the crushing of the head of a near full term baby. Alec, I think your priorities are a little perverted. You should keep your promise and leave the country. Since your career has hit a low point I'll be glad to send a contribution toward a one-way ticket. The only question is where should you go? I would suggest the lower regions. Goodbye, Alec. You won't be missed.
