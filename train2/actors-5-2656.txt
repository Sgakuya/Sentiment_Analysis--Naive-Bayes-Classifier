i just saw keep the faith, which i expected to be a cheesy feel good movie that just left you feeling nothing. however, i believe it had edward norton in it, the best actor EVER. so despite the fact that it WAS a feel good, cheesy movie, it was really worth seeing because once again he did a brilliant job.
