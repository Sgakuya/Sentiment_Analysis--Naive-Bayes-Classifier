here is my letter I just sent these tricksters concerning misleading Promo checks Please reverse the $ 450. fee applied to my account as I was mislead by > the promotional offer which clearly states in BOLD print "there are no > transfer fees or check fees with this offer!" The sentence just above in > the offer states "use them like personal checks....depositing them in your > bank account, etc..."I presume this was treated as a cash advance although > I did not receive any cash and the offer does not clarify any applicable > FEES. Secondly, I was forced by Bank of America to use one of these checks > since the bank would not take a routine deposit without a FIVE day hold. I > have been a customer of this bank for more than 15 years. I will gladly > payoff this VISA balance immediately if necessary. Thank you for your > attention to this matter.
