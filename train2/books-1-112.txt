Alex Haley wrote an AUTObiography of Malcom X? Would somebody please call Mr. Haley and let him know that an AUTObiography is, by definition, WRITTEN SOLEY BY THE PERSON WHO'S LIFE IS BEING WRITTEN ABOUT. Writing about the life of another person is called a biography, not AUTObiography. This is something I learned when I was TEN YEARS OLD. No, I've never read this, but WHAT AN IDIOT.
