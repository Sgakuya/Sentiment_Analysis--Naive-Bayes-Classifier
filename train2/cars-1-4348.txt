Bought this vehicle new in spring of 2000 - I've babied it including only using synthetic oil, etc and 80% highway miles, yet,,, It has had about (15) warranty repairs of which some are: brake system (5) times - leaking wheel cylinders, abs system problems, rotors, proportioning valve replacement, drivers side power window motor replacement, heater fan relay blown, rear wiper motor replacement, transmission repair, replace stereo, front wheel bearing (twice), rear lift gate cylinder replacement. Wanna buy it?
