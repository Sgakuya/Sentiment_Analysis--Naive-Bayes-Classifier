Boy... the difference a little caffiene makes... I simply DO NOT LIKE this root beer! I know, root beer was original meant to be uncaffienated, but after tasting Barq's root beer, how could ANYONE want to go back to this, which in comparison, is pure gunk? I suppose for foam lovers, though, this root beer produces MUCH more foam than Barq's does... I'd hardly consider that a plus, though.
