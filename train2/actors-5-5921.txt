Sean Penn.....by far the best actor in Hollywood and he proved that in I am Sam. Sean Penn played that role like he really lived that life. I wonder everyday why he didn't win the Oscar for that movie. He has made his share of box office bombs but his good roles have always been nothing but EXCELLENT!!! I like the fact that he and his wife Robin Wright Penn keep to themself. I never see them on talk shows begging people to go and see there movies. Dead Man Walking, what a movie. Sean, Susan and Tim Robbins made a break thru when they made that movie, that movie will go down in history!!! Sean Penn I give you a 10 all around!!!!!
