While he was greatly respected as a stage actor, I have always felt this man should have received more recognition from the general public than he did in his all too brief lifetime. He certainly deserved to go out on a more melodious note than as Gomez in the sequel to the Addams Family movie, Addams Family Values . After all, the man was brilliant in Kiss of the Spider Woman (1985) . Actually, he was even brilliant as Gomez Addams. What a tragedy he had to leave so soon.
