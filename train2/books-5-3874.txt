Theo B. like many of the thick headed, literal minded critics of the novel you have completely missed the point of it, ever heard of a word called SATIRE? if you have then you would know that's what mark twain uses throughout the novel to depict how hypocritcal society is and to condemn slavery. Please don't make the mistake of confusing Huck's views and perceptions with those of Mark Twain's, who did not condone slavery, and who praised abolitionists.
