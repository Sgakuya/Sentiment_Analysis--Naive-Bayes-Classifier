This cookbook has been my bible for the past 10 years. I have learned more about technique and the philopshy of chinese cooking than from any other cookbook on the subject. It is a fun book to read and the recipes are outstanding. Granted you need to make many of her specialized pantry items first, but once that is done you will be using them not only for Barbara s recipes but to perk up your everyday foods as well. My children have grown up on these recipes and they are consistanly the most requested ones when ever I cook for friends or family.
