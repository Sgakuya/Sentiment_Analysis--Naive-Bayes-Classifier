I also own one of those 3.8L Mustangs that has gone through one engine in under 30,000 miles due to guess what? A HEAD GASKET THAT BLEW. Less than 16,000 miles later, new engine, it blew another gasket! Don't every think Customer Service that is job one (which is rumored to be subcontracted out to people who have no clue other than what their computer tells them about your car according to VIN #) will ever help help you beyond a warranty. They will help a select few that make a lot of noise, just to shut them up.
