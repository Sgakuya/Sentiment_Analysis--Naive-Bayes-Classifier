I remember an interview with Hurley during which she smoked openly in a non smoking restaurant and boasted to the interviewer that she could get away with it because she was a celebrity. My daughter has asthma, and I would have no qualms telling the celebrity to shove her cancer stick up her bony butt. But that kind of I'm better than the little people attitude is not only troublesome in a person we choose to celebrate, it's also stupid. Fans don't want to be told they are beneath contempt by the actress they love, and neither does the American woman (average size 12) whom Hurley said she'd rather die than share a size with. Hurley is certainly attractive. So was Marilyn. So's the waitress who served me breakfast. Why does Hurley get to insult one and give the other cancer? It sure doesn't make me want to buy any product she endorses or stars in.
