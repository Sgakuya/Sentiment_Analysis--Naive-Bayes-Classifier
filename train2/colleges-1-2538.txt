This school is HORRIBLE. I can't believe it even made this list. I had a visiting professor from their campus once. She had to be good (by their standards), because the school I go to is 100 times better. Anyway, she was 4'6, she tucked her jeans into her socks, her voice was loud and whiny, and to top it all off, she was a bitch. This school SUCKS. AAAH!
