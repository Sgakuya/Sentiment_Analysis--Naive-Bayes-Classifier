My husband and I went into a Powertel store in Dunwoody, GA to sign up. We were ignored while the 'cash' customers, people with the pay-first-for-minutes plan, were actually told to come in front of us in line. Also a man that was purchasing an accessory was told to jump line. Apparently if you are unable to get credit - for whatever reason - you are more welcome at Powertel than if you have a credit history. When we finally approached, the clerk didn't know much about their service area. Needless to say, we went elsewhere for our cell phone service.
