Loan officer did not follow through with commitments, would not return phone calls. His negligence in ordering an FMV on my home for an equity line of credit resulted in a denial. Branch manager contacted General manager who indicated that the denial would stand regardless of their negligence. I have been a customer of USBANK for over 28 years, recently opened an IRA and a business account. In my opinion, they do not value their customers.
