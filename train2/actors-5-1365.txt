I've always liked Robert De Niro, but I never knew much about him until I listened to his biography on tape. I was amazed to learn about the lengths to which he goes in order to assume a character. He does everything within his power to become the character he's playing- often taking extreme measures to do so. For example, he learned to play the saxophone for his role in New York, New York, and he gained 65 pounds in a very short time when he played Jake La Motta in Raging Bull. He goes to great lengths to master accents and mannerisms, and he tries to live the life of a character by doing that person's job, living where that person lived, etc., before actually playing a role. De Niro's obsession with perfection certainly shows in his consistently outstanding performances.
