I loved Lana, she was what a true star should be, always glamourous with the most sinuous walk that rivalled Marilyn. She also gave some very good performances in The Bad and The Beautiful and Madame X. I admired her for going on the stage late in her career, very brave considering she had learned to act only from making films.
