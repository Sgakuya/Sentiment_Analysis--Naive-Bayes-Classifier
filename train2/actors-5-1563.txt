I truly believe Morgan Freeman is THE greatest actor of our generation. I have never seen an actor whose portrayal of a character comes across so naturally. Every character he plays seems as, well real as he were the character himself in real life! He provides just the right touch, the right facial feature, gesture, voice tone in every performance no matter how dull or complex his character may be. He has a such a calm, relaxed, quite nature about himself; a soothing, calming southern accent, an aura of quiet confidence and deft charm. No one in Hollywood is as gifted and underrated as he. I only hope he finally wins an Academy Award that he so richly deserves. Morgan Freeman's acting is so superb that I almost feel embarrassed for his co-stars who were probably hired for eyecandy for the female audience (his high-profile and talentless co-stars in Seven and Chain Reaction) Whether its Pacino, DeNiro, Nicholson, Gibson, Cruise, Hanks, Ford (all of whom I admire a great deal), NO ONE comes close to Mr. Freeman in my mind. How he has never won an Oscar based on his outstanding body of work and is not rated higher on this list is beyond me.
