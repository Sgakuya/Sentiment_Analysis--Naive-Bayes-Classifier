My favorite book on this list. One of the finest books you'll find on Mexican history in general, too. BOP looks at the history of Mexico from independence to the president day. The 'Biography of Power' refers to the unusually powerful role of the president (and before that, various caudillos) in Mexican politics, which Krauze shows had a terrible effect on the country's development. Unlike many history books written for the general public though, Biography of Power is not dumbed down or simplistic; it makes very detailed and convincing arguments. Especially interesting is the last chapter on President Salinas ('The Man Who Would Be King'), for a short time hailed as 'Savior of Mexico.' It was later discovered that under the guise of introducing free-market economics, Salinas made himself (and a few cronies, including his drug kingpin brother!) immensely rich, fleeing the country when the economy collapsed in the early 90s. Translated from the original Spanish, BOP is very readable but also very long (500+ pages). -The writer below should clarify his/her review.-
