 Amistad is Spielberg's best film (it's a true masterpiece about a part of the American history the Americans have no right to be proud of), but The Colour Purple is also a vieweble movie (with both Operah Winfrey Whoopie Goldberg as actresses)! :-) The coolest though with Spielberg is that out of seven children, two of them are adopted Afro-Americans! Who can not like such a great legend?
