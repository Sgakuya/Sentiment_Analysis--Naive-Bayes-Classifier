Wow, I'm surprised this is rated so low. This is easily the best Koontz book I've read in recent years, even better than Intensity or Soul Survivor. In False Memory, Koontz deal with autophobia, which is the fear of oneself. Imagine if you thought you were out to kill yourself and thought you were going to lose control of yourself at any moment. Koontz is masterful in his descriptions of this fear and also supplies a healthy dose of hypnotism insight as well. Koontz seems to be one of those writers who is able to redefine himself over time. False Memory seems to be a harbriner for another phase in Koontz's career in the same way that Watchers heralded in an earlier era for him as a writer. False Memory is highly recommended and is in my top 5 Koontz novels.
