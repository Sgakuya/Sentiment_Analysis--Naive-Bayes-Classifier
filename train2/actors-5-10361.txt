Kate is a great actress who picks very interesting roles. She is one of the most beautiful women in the world. I love, love, love, her body! I am so sick of all the toothpicks out there and am so glad Kate has decided to stay the way she is. I felt the same about Drew Barrymore until she gave in and lost weight, she looked better before!! Anyway, Kate Winslet is THE best actress from the UK, NOT Keira Knightley ... JMO!
