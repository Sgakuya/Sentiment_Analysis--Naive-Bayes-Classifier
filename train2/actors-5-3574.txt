One of my faves. Good at playing good guys, great at playing bad guys. Hans Grueber and the Sherriff of Nottingham come to mind as some of his best villains. I think he was qutie good in Dogma as the underappreciated voice of the Almighty. "Anytime somebody says that God has spoken to them, they're speaking of me... or they're talking to themselves."
