To date, Julia Roberts has never played a serious adult role. Does she have the talent to play a charater such as W. Goldberg played in The Color Purple, or C. Tyson in The Autobiography of Jane Pitman? It's very doubtful. Thus far Julia has only acted in fairy tale type roles, and teen flicks. Face it little girl... Teeth, giggles, hair sray, nor Clairol are an actors best attribute. You are thirty something, so grow up and attempt to act in that capacity.
