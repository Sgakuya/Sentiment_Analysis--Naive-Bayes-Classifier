Did not used to like her, and still think her loser of a hubby reeks, but she is becoming a good actress. She is not doing Shakespeare, but heck, how many times do you want to see that anyway? She was excellent in Freeway, the Election, was perfect in Legally Blonde. I read her interview in Vanity Fair and she comes across as a very mature, caring, with it person.
