Wow! What were the boy's at GM smoking the day they approved this one. There's got to be a different way to look at it to make it look better. I'm sure if they reduced the price by let's say $10K someone would buy one. Guess it's time to sell the GM stock. I think they should rebadge it as an Oldsmobile and let it die with the rest of the Old's A's, B's and I's.
