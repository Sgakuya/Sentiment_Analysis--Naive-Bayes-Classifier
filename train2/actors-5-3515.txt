I think Nicholas Cage is the best actor ever. He is so talented in his ability to adabt to any role. I love all of his movies but I saw Family Man this weekend and think it is the best movie I have ever seen. The emotions that it makes you feel are incredible. Especialy if you have a family. I hope that he can just keep making great movies like this one.
