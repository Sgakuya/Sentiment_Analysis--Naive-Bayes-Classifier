A true literary genius, William S. Burroughs is caught in the depths of a downward spiral of addiction. Even though there is probably not a complete thought in the entire novel, his stream of consciousness writing style is an artform in and of itself. ATTN: Not for casual readers. It takes a serious commitment to finish this book.
