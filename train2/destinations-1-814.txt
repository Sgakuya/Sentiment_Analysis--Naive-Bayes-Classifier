A Canada it's a beautiful country with diverse people and cultures. But then you have DICK, the dirk is silent, who confuses his country with a Korean car and then proceeds to get upset with me when I call him on it. Every site, board or chat room there is has at least one of these Dicks. Let's face it DICK you live in a second rate country where a good part of the population wants to be french. Need I say more and top it of with the fact that it is one of the few countries in the world that is under populated well thats why it gets only 3 stars and DICK your name fits to a T.
