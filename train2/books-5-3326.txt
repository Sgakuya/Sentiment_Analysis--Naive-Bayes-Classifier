I have been a Stephen King fan for quite a while. While he is a horror writer, he has always woven in bits of Sci-Fi/Fantasy, and Spiritual influences. You won't be disappointed with Plant. Check it out, and don't forget to pay your buck (you can even mail in a dollar bill via snail mail). King is constantly pushing the envelope whether it be in his writing or his methods, I think this is an excellent idea and a great way to let his fans know that they are the most important.
