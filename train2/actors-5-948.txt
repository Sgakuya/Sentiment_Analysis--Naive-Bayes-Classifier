Pacino was absolutely brilliant in Scent Of A Woman. He was flawless as a junkie in A Panic In Needle Park. Good gangster stuff in the Godfather movies(with the exception of that third bomb) Scarface. Good cop in Serpico. Two of his best roles(the first two mentioned here) came twenty apart...he didn't get too stale. Oh yeah, there was also that Dog Day Afternoon thing.
