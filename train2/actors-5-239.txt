He could sing, he could dance, but the thing he was best at was making you believe what he was saying. In some movies he would convince you that he was a saint. In the next picture you saw him in, he would make you believe he was a cold blooded killer. I still get chills when I watch him in WHITE HEAT. And I have a hard time hearing him beg for mercy at the end of DEAD END. These are classic moments in motion pictures and Jimmy Cagney brought us many of them.
