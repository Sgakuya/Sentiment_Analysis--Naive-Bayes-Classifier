In 1926, Lang directed Metropolis, one of the greatest science fiction films ever, a clear infueunce to such films as Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. M (1931) is actually a much better film than Metropolis, Lang's first sound film, a truly great suspense thriller that could not have been made in America at the time.
