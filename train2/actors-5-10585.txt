I am a huge fan of Drew's! Being the same age as her I feel like I've grown up with her! It's kind of ironic, but people sometimes call me Drew because I look so much like her. I think she has a natural talent for acting and lights up the screen with her positive energy and enthusiasm. I have recently read her book Little Girl Lost (which by the way was a wonderfully written and very inspirational book!) and was amazed by the eloquence of her words and the maturity in her perception of things which was well beyond her years. I admire her courage for writing about some of the struggles she has been through growing up. I could relate to so much of what she went through. It takes a lot of guts to put yourself out there but she took the chance and has been an inspiration to many people. I think that is part of what makes her so loveable; She's not afraid to show her more personal, human side - to be real. The film industry can be so superficial but she doesn't seem to be so wrapped up in it all that she forgets what's really important to her. I am very happy for her that she has finally got some stability in her life and that she has found a great guy who is also very talented. I know that with her talent, strength, sincereity and that natural sparkle she will go far!!! I would love to meet her one day to thank her for being such an inspiration!
