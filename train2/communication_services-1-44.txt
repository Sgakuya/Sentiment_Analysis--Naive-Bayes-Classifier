For Long Distance, they are AWFUL...High Rates, poor customer service, confusing billing..Overall, they are the worst. They succeed in ONE area, their annoyng marketing campaigns. The commercials definitely stick in your head (no matter how hard you try to rid yourself of them). I do NOT recommend using Sprint for Long Distance.
