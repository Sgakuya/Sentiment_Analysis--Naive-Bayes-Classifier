There's only two actresses of Jodie's generation that i like and they are JODIE and michelle pfeiffer. They both get five stars from me. Jodie is incredible; a great role model who does not let the spotlight get in the way of her craft. What a telented actress. Same goes for Michelle, however, michelle's extraordinary beauty sometimes overshadows her immense talent. Nevertheles, these two women are incredible. Sure as hell beats the crap out of has-beens like Demi 'ugly skank' moore and sharon 'bush' stone. Bashing those two seems to be a trend.
