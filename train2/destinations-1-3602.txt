Recently we were in Santa Fe for three days. Quite frankly I got very, very tired of all the kitchy Indian jewelry and upscale tourist traps. The so-called art galleries all had some variation of the mystical-indian-medicine-woman/mother-earth-figure conjuring up the four winds or whatever. It astounds me that the new agers pay thousands of dollars for this crap. Santa Fe must have been a wonderful place to visit before the East Coast/West Coast crowd screwed it up.
