For a program that serves a lot of military personnel, I didn't find degree programs that supported my military career. Telephone calls and e-mail to Maryland personnel were not responded to. That telephone just rang and rang and rang. Other universities offered better choices in terms of majors, and transfer credit for military personnel. So, eventually I went with another program. I think one can only suck it up and drive on for so long before getting fed up and moving on. Sorry UMUC, you don't provide quality services for the money you expect.
