This is the best comic strip going now. I sometimes think she is taking my life and putting it in front of me. I love it and look at it first in the newspaper before anything else. It puts a smile on my face or tear in my eye before having to read the real drama's we face in the news. Thank you for the opportunity to rate this GREAT comic and writer, Lynn Johnston.
