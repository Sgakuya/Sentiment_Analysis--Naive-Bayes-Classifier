I wish there was a rating between one and two stars. One star seems too harsh because I like Austin and some of the northwest rural sections. But I have to give this state low marks because of the political corruption that is stemming from this place....right up to the President of the United States. I recently heard that hybrid cars like Honda Hybrids are being charged a special TAX to use the roads in Texas because they are relatively independent of oil because of their technology. This line of thinking is completely backwards but does seem to answer the basic question of why we are at war in Iraq. But we'll leave that for another topic on this website.
