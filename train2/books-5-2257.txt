Superior-! This modest little strip is rooted in civility and tradition. Note the polite conversation (among the good guys) and good manners. I'm addicted and rabidly faithful. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Elrod a couple of years ago--he's a genuine Southern gentleman. In my opinion, Jack wants to freeze time, and keep his Lost Forest fantasy safe for kids, who can read the strip with their folks. I only wish the color Sunday feature was available in my city.
