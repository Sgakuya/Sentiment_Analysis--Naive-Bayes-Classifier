He was the definition of suave, sophisticated and debonair. But I think his great appeal lay in his ability to be all that and still be able to do fall on your face humor. That kind of thing is always a killer combination and the reason I liked him as much in movies like Father Goose as anything else he ever did. Humor had a way of bringing this untouchably handsome man to a level of reality that actually made him seem accessible. He was a genius at that kind of thing I think because, for all his looks, success, fortune and fame, Cary never forgot that young cockney chap Archibald Leach.
