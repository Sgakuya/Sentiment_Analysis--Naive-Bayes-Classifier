I cant not believe she is being nominated for Erin Brockovich. Hello. Its just like the rest of her movies. Shes cute, corky, and you will have no choice but to fall in love with her. Acting like a fowl mouthed, sleezy dressing, SECRETARY, is not Oscar material. She was able to get into character so easily, because she has done already!! Call your self an actress when you do something different. Pretty Woman part 15 is getting old.
