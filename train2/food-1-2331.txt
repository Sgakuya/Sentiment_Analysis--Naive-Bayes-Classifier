just terrible. the 100 grand bar is way to hard to eat. the outside chocolate part is okay but, as soon as you bite into it the caramel comes out and goes everywhere, then the chocolate starts melting making and makes an even bigger mess. also, its so thick that its hard to take a bite. its sticky and messy, and it doesnt even taste that good.
