I think Angela Cartwright was a very good, perhaps even underrated child actress. She's a slight bit older than I am, but I can remember when she was on the Danny Thomas show. That was followed by her role in The Sound of Music and later as Penny on Lost in Space. BTW: I found a better picture just for you SolenoidDH since you are the top Angela Cartwright fan around here! Hope you approve.
