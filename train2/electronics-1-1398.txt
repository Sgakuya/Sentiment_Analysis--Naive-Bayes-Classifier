Do not purchase this device. It's a great size, yes, and wonderful to listen to while excercising...but the software is a complete nightmare. When I upgraded my PC to Windows XP, the original software and drivers would not install properly. Even after downloading a software upgrade from the Sony Web site, it could not find the device. Now I'm stuck with a $200+ MP3 player whose software will never let me get rid of the original 16 songs I uploaded to it! Will I have to listen to Rage Against the Machine forever?!!! Trust me, don't buy it!
