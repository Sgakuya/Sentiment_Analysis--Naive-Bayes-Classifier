South Carolina is one of the most beautiful states in the United States. Apparently Musicfan is as delusional as Strom Thurmond's stinky incontinent ghost. It's the most boring place i've ever visited (and that includes Mongolia). 5% of Charleston is nice, and the rest is worse than Camden, NJ. If you want to have fun go to Savannah. The best part of my visit was the ride to the airport. I hope you all rot in Hell, you possum-eating scum!
