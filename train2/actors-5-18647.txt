The guy is insane. I mean that in the nicest way possible. He is crazy, hilarious and entertaining. See the name Mel Brooks attached to anything and you know you will be gaurenteed a good time and a few laughs. Brilliant actor, director, and producer. Who can ever forget THE 2000 YEAR OLD MAN he did along with Carl Reiner, another underapreciated comic genius.
