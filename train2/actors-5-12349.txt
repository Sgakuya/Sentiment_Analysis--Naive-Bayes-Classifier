I cried along with Halle when she won her academy award. She is truly an inspiration and she seems to be so down to earth, which is refreshing. I have been waiting for a movie like Monster's Ball my entire life because few movies show the reality of mixed relationships. I am multiracial and I am also in an interracial marriage. Movies that depict people like us don't come out that often and I am happy to see when we're depicted without sterotypes and limitations. Most of Hollywood fears depicting affectionate, sensual, loving relationships between African-American women (or even part African American women) and someone of another race. I'm glad that Halle opened the door . Way to go, Halle!
