I had the unfortuante experience of having a phone break and wihout a service plan for the phone, I kept coming up against so many obstacles, that I finally gave up. So when I relented to their suggestion that I could go out and buy a phone anywhere, the store where I was buying it ( at a cost of $129.99 plus $150 in service fees, called Cingular to activae the phone, they refused unless I would agre on extending the contract by to years. For What!!!! I told that the only contract I would sign is with another provider; they did care. Kathleen Downing is supposed to be in charge of customer service, does anyone know her phone number or address ( land or e-mail) their web site provides neither. Thanks
