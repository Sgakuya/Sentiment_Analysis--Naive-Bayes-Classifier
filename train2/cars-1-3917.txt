Words cannot express how much I despise these vehicles and anyone vain enough to buy them. Say what you will about the guy who buys sports cars - this god damn thing is a veritable penis on wheels, the ultimate egomobile, if you will. It just reminds me of that SUV from the Simpsons, the Canyonero, or the Maibatsu Monstrosity ( Mine's Bigger ) from Grand Theft Auto 3. There are basically two kinds of people who drive Cadillac Escalades. The first type are wealthy, 5'3 , 110-lb., suburban soccer moms who absolutely, positively NEED six thousand pounds of overpriced steel to fetch groceries and pick up their children from their state-funded indoctrination facilities. The other, and perhaps more vomitous type is the bling-bling sh!t rap crowd who throw 22 gold Daytons on there and say, Uh, yeeeaahh. I be suphistimucated. Holla! Westport, the big weekend party spot here in Kansas City is just crawling with totally overdone Escalades with ridiculously huge rims and bass systems you can hear for miles (usually taking it upon themselves to assume that everyone within ten blocks really DOES want to hear In da Club - again). And each one of these hideous mechanical beasts that rolls by is packed with a bunch of thugs who for some reason think they have status because their ride is tackier. The Asscalade is second only to the Hummer H2 on my Most Hated Vehicle of All Time list. But with things the way they are, with the luxury cars becoming larger and more expensive, it's only a matter of time before these thugs start going to trucking companies and tricking out big rigs. Mark my words, it'll happen. You'll be channel surfing one day and you'll see 50 Cent sitting atop a Mack CH Series hauler (haula?), no doubt taking the time to let you know how bad he is (yaaawwwnnn...). And that's when you'll know it really has gone totally out of control.
