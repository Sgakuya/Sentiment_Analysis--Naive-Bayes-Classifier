Election, Pleasantville, Freeway, Opposite of Sex... Reese is a fabulous actress and a beautiful woman, she also strikes me a-- not that I know her -- as an interesting, down to earth, intelligent person. At any rate, she has never said anything in an interview that gives her away as being mindless or shallow. So I'm a fan! Yay Reese! Keep making interesting films and doing a beauitful job.
