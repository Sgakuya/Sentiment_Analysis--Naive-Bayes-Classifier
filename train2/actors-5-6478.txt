Billy Bob Thornton is one of those rare individuals who can not only turn in dynamite performances as a co-star (Tombstone) and as a star (Slingblade), but can also show considerable talent behind the camera. For those who may have missed his outstanding recent film, All the Pretty Horses, I encourage all of you to see it on video.Don't miss the soundtrack either -- it's some of the finest contemporary Western music done in years! Mr. Thornton said recently that he prefers acting to directing because he's afraid of letting alot of people down if the films he directs don't do well at the box office. While I empathize with his sentiments, I don't support him avoiding the director's chair. Mr. Thornton should keep using his talents and holding firm to his cinematic vision. If he does so both his audiences and his industry colleagues will greatly benefit, especially from films like All the Pretty Horses.
