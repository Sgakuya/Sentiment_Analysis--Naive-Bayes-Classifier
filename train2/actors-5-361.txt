I liked a lot of the movies Henry Fonda was in. He was good in the Grapes of Wrath. I liked him in Mr.Roberts. and perfect as Norman the elderly man in ON Golden Pond.I was glad to see him finally win an oscar for the latter role.He played similar roles to James Stewart, and Jack Lemmon, the everyman who others can relate to.
