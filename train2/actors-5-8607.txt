I loved Marlene, she was the epitome of what a great star was all about. You could never take your eyes off her when she was on screen. She was great in Stage Fright, Foreign Affair and especially Witness for the Procecution. She was also mesmerising when seen in live in concert. I have some very happy memories of her.
