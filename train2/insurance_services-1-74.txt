This insurance agency is a frickin joke. I have been with them through my parents till I was out on my own. I had a minor accident with my truck and a hidden pole in a dark parking lot that put a scrap in my door. I have full coverage and have been a great customer. They inspected it and said I can get a used door from a junk yard and reuse the dented molding. All This on a new truck? I told them they were high and if they didn't foot the bill I would seek my attorney on them. I then got my check in the mail. I've heard that they hate to pay up on claims and dissmissed them till now.
