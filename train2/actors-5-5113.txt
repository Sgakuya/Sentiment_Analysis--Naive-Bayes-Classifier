i always try to support all my fellow canadians on this site and kiefer is one of the best. growing up in the 80's i guess i will always strongly remember him for the lost boys and stand by me(two really cool bad guys) somthing that kiefer always seems to bring to his roles not to mention alot of talent.would to see him and his dad act together in a big screen film.
