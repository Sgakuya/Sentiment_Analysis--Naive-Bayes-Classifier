I love everything about Viggo Mortensen. I have over 50 toys,books,cd's and posters from LOTR! I think he did a very good job in Lord of the Rings and Hidalgo. Indeed he is still the king. He blends in with the movie so well as Aragorn. I have a chess game and a trivia game. I know almost everything about LOTR! I put him before any one except for Billy Boyd and Elijah Wood.
