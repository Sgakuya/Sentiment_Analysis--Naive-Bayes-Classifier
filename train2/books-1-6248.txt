As I said before, I would never read a book titled such as this. I don't care if the book itself is really awesome, but if this author cannot come up with a title that is a little less racist, then I am not gonna buy it. IF this same author had titled the book STUPID BLACK MEN, or STUPID HISPANIC MEN, you can bet all kinds of drama would have occured already, and he would be banned everywhere. Until this man changes the overly racist title, I do not recommend this garbage to anyone..... '''Kolby
