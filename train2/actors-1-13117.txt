Granted, she is a pretty good actress, Thelma and Louise was tolerable. I just have a problem with someone chastising someone else because their political or social views are different from their own. I think freedom of speech is still legal in America ? right? I remember her campaigning a few years ago to get Dr. Laura's show taken off the air because she disagreed with Dr. Laura's conservative views. Now granted I am no fan of Dr.Laura, but this kind of strikes me as bullcrap, fascist. What will she do next?, try to get the Mormon religion banned in Utah because it's too conservative for her?
