Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte is my all time favorite book. Plain orphan, abandoned by a cruel aunt becomes a governess, meets the love of her life and receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. After being locked in a room, finding out her true love was already married and losing her only real friend. I first read it when I was ten and the martyred melodrama is always fun.
