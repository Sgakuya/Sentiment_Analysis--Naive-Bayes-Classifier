Probably the most talented actress of our times. Her work with Louis Malle is a very important contribution to the art of cinema. Very couragous of her to speak her mind in a society that can't stand looking at the dark side of the world we live in.This will maybe destroy her professionally at some point, but the fact that she knows and still keeps on with her good work inside and outside the cinema industry, makes her really special.
