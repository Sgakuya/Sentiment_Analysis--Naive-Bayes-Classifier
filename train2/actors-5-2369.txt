I absolutely love Mel Gibson. He is one of the few actors out there that actually can become his role. I mean, actor's like Tom Hanks and Robert Dinero (spelling?) are always Tom and Robert similar to Julia Roberts. Also, Mel as an overall GOOD person. He's had one wife and 7 children, which is pretty unusual in hollywood. Everything about him is exactly what i'm look for in a celeberty. Overall he is and outstanding actor and person!!!!
