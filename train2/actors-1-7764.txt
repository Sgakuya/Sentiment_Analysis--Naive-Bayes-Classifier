I can't stand this guy. He was so spectacularly annoying in Terminator 2 that he single-handedly tainted the entire movie for me. And that one performance formed such a negative impression in my mind that I will continue to avoid Furlong for the rest of his - hopefully short - acting career. I rented American History X without knowing he was in it, and I admit that he wasn't nearly as annoying in that movie, but every time I saw him on the screen I involuntarily heard him in my head saying Hasta la vista, baby in that scratchy, grating, nails-on-a-chalkboard voice. Please make him go away.
