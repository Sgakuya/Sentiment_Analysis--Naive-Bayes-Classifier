i don't know how he does it, but bill watterson gets into the mind of a six year old so easily and didn't sell out or make it too cutesy. it's everything a comic strip should be. funny, clever, written with wisdom... like foxtrot, it is also written from true observation and has unique charachters with real personalities. calvin is that obnoxious little part in all of us we try to supress but is part of our human natue, and hobbes is that occasional wisdom that comes to our minds. whenever people say comic strips lack in creativity i show them this one.
