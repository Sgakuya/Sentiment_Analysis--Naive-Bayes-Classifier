What's wrong with this ratings list? Why is this book at #71 of 96, when it SHOULD be close to 60 places higher? I did not expect this from the author of the entertaining-but-silly Wayside School series, and I was astounded. The boys at Green Lake, despite being juvenile delinquents, are very easy to relate to. Sachar portrays them as human, and not as junior thug hoodlums, and that's a fairly unique perspective (not only in books, but in the rest of the world). An incredible read for elementary students, and I still pick it up to read it again on occasion.
