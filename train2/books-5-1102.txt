As far as I'm concerned, Go Dog Go is one of the top two children's books ever written (along with What Do People Do All Day? Sure I like Dr. Suess, Curious George, Clifford, Babar, and the other classics, but Go Dog Go really captured my imagination. Who wouldn't want to go to that huge dog party in the tree? Even though I haven't read the book in years and years, I distinctly remember lots of the illustrations and scenes - like when all the dogs go to sleep on that big bed, how one dog keeps asking another dog if he likes her hat (once as they pass each other at the top of a mountain), how they race around in cars... Man, any book that stays with you that long must be something special.
