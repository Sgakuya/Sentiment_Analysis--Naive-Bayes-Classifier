A very funny and entertaining book. It starts off slowly and builds. The hero of our tale is Ignatius Reilly, a strange young fellow who believes that the world reached it's intellectual and cultural peak in the Middle Ages. He despises work, popular culture, and most anything he comes across, and loudly proclaims the inadequacies of all and sundry about him. Worth a read, especially if you enjoy wild characters and unexpected situations.
