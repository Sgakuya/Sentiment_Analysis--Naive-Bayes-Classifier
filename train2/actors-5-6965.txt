Ethan Hawke has great talent, and despite what most people say, I feel that his mysterious lifestyle is what makes him a normal human being. He doesn't over express himself and he knows how to keep his personal life away from the media. Besides that, his work is excellent. When I saw him in Reality Bites , I just wanted to him, but at the same time I wanted to love him. He was brilliant in Snow Falling on Cedars . His acting as well as his fellow actors in the film were great. Ethan Hawke moves me, and when someone's acting moves me, I know immediately that that person has wonderful talent. Keep on with the films Ethan, I'm dying to see your talent on the screen again.
