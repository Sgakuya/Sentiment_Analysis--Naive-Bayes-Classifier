The first time I, or probably, anyone noticed Natalie Portman was in The Professional . She played the role with woman-like strength and 'little girl lost' vunerability. She was entrancing as Mathilda. Seeing her recently in Where The Heart Is , it struck me how beautiful and talented this girl really is. She carries herself with all the poise and grace of a young Audrey Hepburn. I hope we see sooo much more of her!
