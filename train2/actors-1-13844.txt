I have made only one serious stipulation in my marriage and that stipulation is that I will never, ever, pay for, or sit through a Julia Slob-erts movie. Suffice to say that I would rather be dragged over broken glass, and then doused with salt and alcohol, and then set afire rather than endure this wretched actress s thespian efforts on the silver screen or in any other media format.
