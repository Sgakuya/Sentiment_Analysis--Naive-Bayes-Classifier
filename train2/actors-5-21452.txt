She was FANTASTIC as Ally McBeal. I miss the first 2 years of that show. After that it went downhill as most shows do. But she was so good in that role: perky, neurotic, sort of smart but yet kinda of dumb. She should land on her feet someone where soon. I believe she kissed three, count em, THREE, different women on that show, on the lips. America, land of the free!!!
