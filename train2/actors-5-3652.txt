I think he is a fabulous actor, and has staying power. He delivers a strong performance in both the first and second LOTR. He plays the part of Legolas wonderfully and is by far the most intriguing and exciting character. I also really enjoyed him in Pirates of the Caribbean. I can't wait to see him in more movies to come.
