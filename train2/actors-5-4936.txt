Oh for crying out loud. What does his personal life have to do with his acting ability? Put down the National Enquirer and go see 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, Seven or Kalifornia. He may be a pretty boy, but the man can act. Unfortunately he gets judged unfairly due to his great looks. Looks and relationships have nothing to do with his acting. I hope to see him take more roles that allow him to stretch his talent. Given the right role, and the opportunity to be left alone by the press for 5 seconds, I firmly believe he's capable of winning an Academy Award someday.
