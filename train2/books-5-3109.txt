Disturbing story that never let me leave Ludlow in my mind... and in my nightmares. Zelda's twisting spine with hands that seemed to be claws, kept cutting her why into my thoughts late at night, mid-way and after the book. The horror never ended, leaving you making your own happy little ending. One of my personal favorites.
