Pez has got to be the most annoying candies to me. The only highlight I get is the various colorful dispensers they come in. Other than that, Pez candies have no unique flavor. It's just something to snack on if there's nothing else to eat. There really is no distinct flavor that makes it stand out from other candies. This is a very boring candy!
