Maurice Benard is the Denzel Washington of Daytime. He is the Muhammad Ali of Soaps. He is the Elvis Presley of method actors. I have never witnessed such grace and goodness in an actor. He has a medical problem that would kill the common man, but he has risen above that challenge and created the most memorable Soap Opera character in the History of Daytime. He is a perfect 10!
