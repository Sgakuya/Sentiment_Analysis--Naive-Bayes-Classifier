What a bore. I went to Nfld. on a school trip during my high school days and was bored to tears. It's basically nothing but a big rock situated off the eastern Canadian coast. The 'downtown' district in St.John's was a joke. Newfoundlanders sure have a way of making visitors unwelcome, especially if you look like you don't 'fit in'. Basically, there's nothing to see.....unless you like the ocean and lots of fog!
