I really regret ever getting in bed with Sprint PCS. First they lied and said that in northern Michigan I would have no prob getting signals. WRONG! there are no towers around with them. So anyway I tried to get in touch with them and was given the runaround by rude unfriendly operators who basically said they don't care about my reception problems. Right now I'm just waiting for my contract to end on a phone I can't use. Also they phone has stopped working and had to be replaced. They really suck. BEWARE!
