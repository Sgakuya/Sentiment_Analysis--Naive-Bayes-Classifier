Canada doesn't even deserve the one star. This place sucks. There isn't anything to do there and the people are boring. Add on the fact that they are obsessed with the US and dedicate their lives to copying and competing with the US and it adds up to the most boring, pathetic country on the planet. And for the record, the reason why people aren't attacking Canada is because Canada is insignificant and unimportant. People in the middle east probably don't even know that this shitty country exists!!!!
