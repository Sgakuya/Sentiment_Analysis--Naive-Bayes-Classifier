I moved from AZ to TX in Oct 2000. I tried for 4 months to get my area code changed, but nobody in customer service could help. I held for 2-4 hours waiting for a supervisor to help, but they were as frustrated and uninformed as their reps.( I have 3 phones in my office so I was able to test this while working one day- besides their hold music receives a better rating than their service. Yes I am admitting that I am 45). This company lost me business because I couldn't receive voice mail at my new location. Finally, I spoke to a Rep. who offered a solution-buy a new phone. I took them up on it and purchased a phone with AT T coverage and couldn't be happier. VERIZON IS THE WORST. I think the good ratings came from concerned stockholders and employees!
