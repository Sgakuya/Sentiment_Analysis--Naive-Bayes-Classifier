Clever, witty, intelligent, beautiful... These are only a few adjectives that come to mind when I think of Janeane Garofalo. She is one of those awesome girls you meet in college who always has an intelligent, sarcastic remark about anything remotely stupid your professor says. It only makes me wonder what the hell is she doing in films like The Truth About Cats and Dogs and The Matchmaker even though it was she who breathed life into them. She has an awesome talent and even when she plays the bitch , you still can't help but have an affection for her!
