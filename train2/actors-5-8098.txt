Probably one of the greatest actresses, ever. Loved her in Now, Voyager, and All About Eve and was truly terrified of her in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? She was rumored to be a very difficult actress on the set, but she was actually fighting for her artistic integrity. Warner Brothers put her in some movies that were very mediocre, and because of the terms of her contract, she could not get out of doing some of these stinkers. I don't blame her for being mad. Give 'em hell, Bette!
