USC has too much beauracracy...go here..go there just to register for a course. I have also had some a-hole instructors who played favoritism. There are also a-hole students who make your school life miserable at SC. SC is also fraternity-oriented,..meaning there are parties and if you're not part of the frat group, don't expect them to talk to you. All in all, I got treated like crap at SC. I hated it.
