I think as a teenager Sarah Jessica Parker is a talented beautiful actress. I have looked up to her and she has inspired me to do many things i would not have done if it were not for her. Her show is a typical realistic setting for 4 middle aged single woman. I love her wardrobe and dressed as her for halloween, and our school's favorite actor day for SPIRIT WEEK. I hope someday i will be half as cool as she is
