Massachusetts government is the worst bunch of post witch murdering, corrupt, money hungry fascists I've ever been witness to. People can say nice things about the history and it is nice. Im assuming most of these people arent residents. I moved here in 8th grade and have lived here since. About 15 years and I noticed to snobbish attitude on day one and it hasnt changed. The system is set up in such a way that if you get down on your luck, they make sure you stay down. The registry of motorvehicals is strictly a vehicle for them to generate revenue off John Q and they fully admit it. Last year they made the minimum cost of speeding tickets $100. $25 goes to the state, $25. to some head trauma fund??? And the other $50. to a general fund. Yeah. what the hell is that? Anyway, I can see why people want to go postal in this state.
