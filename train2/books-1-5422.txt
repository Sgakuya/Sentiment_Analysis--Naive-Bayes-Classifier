Terribly overrated. I don't see how the character, Landon, can be a role model. He dejects, hurts, and makes fun of a girl named Sally because she was born with only one eye! Is that her fault? And Landon goes for Jamie after he sees how beautiful she looks in a white gown at a play. Realistic love, huh? Jamie isn't that good of a character. She's just one of those prudish-good-girl-My-name-is-Sandy bible quote reciting kids. And just like in Grease, The bad boy changes her. Makes her beautiful to everyone else instead of showing her natural good points.
