They delay crediting your account purposely to charge late and overlimit fees. We use a bill pay service and have seen where capital one has actually deposited the check from the service before the due date and took 29 days from date of payment to credit it. They couldn't explain why. Thanks to bill pay for fighting it and getting charges removed(bill pay automatically deducts from your account and then issues a check from their acct. to the creditor-this is the check that is deposited by Capital one) They raise int. rates for no reason and to unreasonable rates.
