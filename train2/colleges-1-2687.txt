What a dismal place. A stop off I-35 with a football field, nothing else. No reason to get excited about a degree here unless it's Medical, because the Hospital (located downtown OKC, NOT Norman) is a nice teaching hospital. Look elsewhere for an education. If a quality education is not important to you and you are a football fan (football only, they have a Top 5 basketball teams and can't sell any tickets) then you might have fun, if that is all that is important to you. One should add, however, there are no clubs in Norman. If you want to go out you must drive to OKC.
