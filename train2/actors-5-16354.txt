Maurice is amazing! He has the ability to project his character's (Sonny Corinthos) feelings by his gestures and facial expressions as well as his dialog. When Sonny speaks, Maurice paints a picture with his voice of Sonny's emotions no matter how deeply he wants to keep them buried. Maurice's every scene is memorable and I feel privileged to be his fan. Cathy
