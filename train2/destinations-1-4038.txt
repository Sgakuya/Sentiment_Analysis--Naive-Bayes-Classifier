Here is a list (and just a preliminary one) of why Cincinnati is the most screwed up ridiculous place and why I thank the lord every night that I only have ONE WEEK LEFT! -Hyde Park and everything it represents -Chili(has chocolate and death in it) -Obsession with zip codes -Obsession with where people went to High School -East Side/West Side rivalry - WHO CARES! -Lack of diverse thought -Lack of personality -Saying please? instead of what? or excuse me? -Bad 80's hair -Bad 80's fashion -80% gray gloomy weather -Hyde Park again -Close minded natives -Homophobes everywhere -Racists everywhere -People can't figure out four way stop intersections -People pass in the right lane on the highway -People drive under the speed limit in the left lane -Waiters/Waitresses can't figure out to bring the check once people have finished eating -Downtown is dead -People are scared of downtown -No sense of humor -Attitude in Mt. Adams (see Hyde Park references) -General unhappiness of its residents -Very scary place for non-natives to live, socialize and work I could go on, but I have wasted more time in and on CIncinnati than I care to admit
