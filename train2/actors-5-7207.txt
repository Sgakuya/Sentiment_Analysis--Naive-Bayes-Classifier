Any person who says life is beautiful is not a master-piece can go to hell. It is undoubtedly one of the most moving movies after citizen kane and schindler's list and it haunted me for days to come. Life is beautiful frankly sets all it's american rival films into dust. A heart warming classic that I could watch every day of the year. And Yeah, Benigni might not be par with some one like Al Pacino or Tom Hanks but he is a Goddamn genious all the same. Just a fabulous movie!!
