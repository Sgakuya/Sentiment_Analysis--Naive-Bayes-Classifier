We were set to get a Home Improvement/Refinance loan and had everything setup with the contractor and were ready to go. I even had an email from the loan officer stating what our locked-in interest rate was. The day before closing, I called them for something and the Loan Officer says, By the way, your interest rate is going up by 1% with 2 points. This ruined everything and therefore we could not go through with the loan. This was a Bait and Switch tactic they used and I would NOT recommend Wells Fargo to my worst enemy. It sickens me that they get away with such predatory lending daily.
