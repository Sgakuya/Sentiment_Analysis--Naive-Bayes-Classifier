Her acting carried a lot of skill and she was very good at her roles. She was definetly a looker, but a crappy mother. A very crappy mother, but I am rating her as an actress. She was always more realistic in her roles than Katherine Hepburn or Rita Hayworth. I also think Joan was mentally ill. Highly. I don't think she should have had kids. But since I am rating her as a classic actress, She truly is one.
