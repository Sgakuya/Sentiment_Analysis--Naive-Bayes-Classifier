My mind still boggles as to why so many dark, sad-ending, dullfests of novels are considered classics when great Star Trek and Star Wars novels are considered formulaic and mindless. Well, I don't know why that is, but I know that THIS book is just dead. It's boring, with no excitement anywhere. The dialgoue is impossibly stitled and not humorous in the slightest. It also has an extremely cynical and depressing ending, which does no one any good. And, people actually LIKE this book?
