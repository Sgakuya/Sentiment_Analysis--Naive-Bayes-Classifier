I think that Freddie is one of the greatest actors around, he's very talented and I think that he's got a lot of guts exposing that wonderful face of his all over the world, he's one of the most wonderful guys that I think is in the acting business ... And that girlfriend of his, well I think he could do better, more like me ... But hey once I turn the legal age I'm sure he'll be free then:) I love Freddie, and hope to meet him soeday. He's great, and that girlfriend of his Michelle, sure is one lucky girl.
