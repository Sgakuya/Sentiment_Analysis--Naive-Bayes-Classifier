hi everyone! i just want to say how much of spectacular actress Meg Ryan is. I love all her movies. My favorite is between When Harry Met Sally and You've Got Mail. i really dislike when they critize her on her dramatic performances. i think she does a great job on any kind of performance. i had to rate her a five because that was the highest but she is beyond 5. she's the best actress in world.((sorry im just a really big fan)) i know that we will all see her in other films to come. MEG RYAN IS THE GREATEST!!!
