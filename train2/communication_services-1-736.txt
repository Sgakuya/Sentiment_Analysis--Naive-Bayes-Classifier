What a foolish company! The reception i have is horendous! I live in Staten Island, NY one of the boroughs of NYC. In my house, i'm roaming! I cant make a phone call without the call dropping. I now attend Columbia University which is right in the city... I cannot walk across campus w/o the call dropping, and let's not even get into the 30+ dead zones. In my dorm, and in MANY, MANY buildings no reception. i have to literally stick my head out the window to pick up service, and there's really no pt. in the this b/c the call would drop or not even pick up. Why am i paying the stupid company month after month for HORRIBLE SERVICE!? I called them and explain my problem... Well maam, there must be a building blocked our towers. then why would be put it up there. Of they said try buying a new phone... but this is just another way they can get more of your money... my friends have brand new sprint phone... NO SERVICE! I will be switching as soon as this # portablity is available. For anyone out there that is thinking of a cell phone company... NOT SPRINT... Verizon on the other hand, well thats a different story
