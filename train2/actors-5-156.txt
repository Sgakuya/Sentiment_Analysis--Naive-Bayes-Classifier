Humphrey Bogart was truly an american original. Nobody looked like him, he wasn't a great looking man but he could still play a convincing romantic lead. Nobody sounded like him, just try and say Play it again Sam without using Bogart's voice. It just doesn't have the same meaning. Nobody could smoke a cigarette and make it seem so cool, even though we know it killed him. I have tried to watch all of his movies. There have been many great ones that he made better, and there are some that were not so great, but his performance was always superb.
