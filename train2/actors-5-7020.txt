I agree with Teaseress this guy does have a huge amount of potential yet he s another one who really makes you wonder what he s thinking with some of his film choices. Even so, he s one of those enigmatic personalities that have the ability to draw me in regardless of the subject matter or weakness of story or plot. In a word, Slater s persona is simply curious. Oh, I realize it s completely calculated - though I always thought he was doing James Dean rather than Nicholson which makes more sense. Still, he fascinates me. From the hilarious black comedy Heathers (Winona Ryder was excellent in this too BTW) to Adam in the poignant love story Untamed Heart he has used this magnetic quality to flesh out some very memorable if not pretty far off the wall characters. I feel he could be one of the better-remembered actors of his era if he had a few high budget mainstream hits to his credit. Somehow though I don t think mainstream is what he s shooting for.
