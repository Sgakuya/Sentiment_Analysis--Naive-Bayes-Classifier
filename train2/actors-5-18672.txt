The vision of this man is nothing more than genius. He is a man of perfection, ambience and detail. You can watch his films time and time again and see or hear something different. Blade Runner being the best with Alien coming a close second, then Gladiator - one hell of a masterpiece and the all time chick flick Thelma and Louise.
