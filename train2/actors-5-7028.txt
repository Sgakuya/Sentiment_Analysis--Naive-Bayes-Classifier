Christian Slater is a great actor. I saw him the play Sideman in New York and he was amazing. He was also very sweet to all the fans that waited to meet him. He seems a like a very genuine person. I can't wait to see The Contender and the other projects he is working on. Best of all I am hoping he will do another play!!!
