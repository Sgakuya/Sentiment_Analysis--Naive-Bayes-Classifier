I'll say this, we left after one night of our honeymoon. Our bed was infested with Bugs. The food is served by ringing a dinner bell and served buffet style, reminiscent of summer camp. The food was terrible. The All-Inclusive served beer in 8oz cups and only draft. The luxury room consisted of a cement shower stall? And it was all incredibly expensive. It was in a beautiful location. Perhaps they could level it and build a Half Moon Negril!
