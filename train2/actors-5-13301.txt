Megan has a great singing voice, with respect to her 'Big as a Berry' CD. I hear that she has great stage presence in her singing gigs, although I have not had the good fortune of personally seeing her. I hope to if she ever comes to the Midwest. I also hope she records more albums (CDs) in the future.
