Ethan Hawke is my favorite actor. I still remember the first time I saw him in WHITE FANG as a young girl. He was so amazing. That became my favorite movie for quite some time. GREAT EXPECTATIONS was also a great movie for him. I love that story. He is absolutely beautiful. Uma is truly a lucky woman.
