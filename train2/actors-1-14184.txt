She was a cute kid and was OK in Clarissa and early Sabrinas but as she got older and Sabrina became old, I thought she just sucked. I hated it when she thought she was too cool and started talking about her partying and sex life. Did anybody really have to know that Sabrina was a party girl? She is just not an interesting enough actress who is only just decent eye candy now.
