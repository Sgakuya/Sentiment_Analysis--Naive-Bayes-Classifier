Aww, I had the biggest crush on Elliot when I was little, and I never connected him with the Henry Thomas who I see today in Gangs of New York and I'm With Lucy. He's such a fabulous actor, not to mention terribly cute. I love his auburn hair and soft eyes -- so sexy, it's amazing he doesn't get more notice.
