Whether you agree with his ideas on politics and the world in general, Garry Trudeau has a very subtle and witty humour that really pulls this strip through....It's one of my personal favourites. The characters actually have personalities that make them identifiable, which is more than I can say for alot of the strips out there. It's the kind of comic that incites debate between you, your parents, friends, spouses, relatives....And debate helps you understand people better. 5 stars for a great, involved strip! 'Tara'
