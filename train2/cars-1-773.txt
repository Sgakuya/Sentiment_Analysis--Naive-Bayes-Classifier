Incredibely poor quality. Seems underdimensioned to me, like if it was simply not meant to be used as an everyday means of transportation. I am also unsatisfied with the balance of the bike. Have had the following troubles in 3.5 years (rides maybe 15-25 km:s a day): - replaced the rear gear casette and chain twice - flywheels seems to last 1-1.5 years - one of the gear shift handles broken and replaced - one brake caliper broken - mountings for brake calipers deformed, both front and rear, meaning I can not get the brake pads straightly adjusted at the rims. Compared to my previous bikes, a 10-geared Crescent and a 12-geared Motobecane, this is junk.
