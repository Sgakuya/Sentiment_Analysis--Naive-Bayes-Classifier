Inspired and laugh-out-loud funny. When I was in junior high school, I met Gary Larson at a book-signing, and he drew a cow in my copy of the original Far Side compilation. I remember thinking how cool it was that he took the time to include something extra with his signature. I mean, after signing 10,000 of those, would you really be in the mood to prolong the experience? Anyway, when the Far Side came along, it was unique and usually hilarious in a skewed, off-center kind of way. I still remember classics like The real reason dinosaurs became extinct, and What we say to dogs - what dogs hear.
