Val Kilmer is one of the best and he is still honing his craft. I saw Val Kilmer for the first time in Tombstone as Doc Holiday. I got a copy of the video when it was released and have tried to see everything else he has done since then. While he is one of the all time great actors, the character he portrayed in The Saint was very good but not the best work he has done or is capable of doing. Some of the voices seemed very familiar for all those disguises he used them with. He will be another of a small group of actors that have staying power as his career spans the next 20 to 30 years.
