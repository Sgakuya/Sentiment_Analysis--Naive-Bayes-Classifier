Ugh, this is the sweetest, nastiest cereal EVER. I really can't stand the fake berry taste, the hard marshmallows even the smell repulses me. The only cool thing about this cereal is the ghost on the package..other than that..NOTHING. And I like my sugary cereal from time to time, but Boo Berry goes way overboard for me.
