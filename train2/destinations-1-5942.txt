Sure it has unspoiled scenic beauty (until the rightwing greedheads start drilling for oil up there, or otherwise exploiting the abundant natural resources), but little else. Frost bound half of the year. Second-rate educational system and absolutely no culture. You can make a good living there because very few people would want to live in this low-rent icebox, so wages are high. But so is the cost of living, so it's a push. High degree of alcoholism in Alaska, and no wonder: it's got to be one of the most boring and depressing places to live in North America. Finally, the people are kinda iffy: seems like the state isn't a place to run to, rather, it's a place to hide out because you running away from something else somewhere else. What is particularly amusing is this insistance on the myth that Alaskans are the last of the free-spirit, independent, self-reliant pioneering Americans: since most of these people vote Republican, you have to wonder how free-spirited they truly are, and considering that Alaska benefits to a tremendous extent on Federal largess, these self-deluding slackers and moochers are actually dependent on taxpayers in the lower 48 to shore up their underperformance. It makes me laugh, a state so solidly in the Republican ethos of personal responsibility and small government, yet constantly have their hands out, gimme gimme, just as long as they don't have to pay for it. What a joke.
