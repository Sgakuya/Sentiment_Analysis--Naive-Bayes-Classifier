Please let me know what kind of drugs Mel Gibson was on when he made The Million Dollar Hotel so I will never take that drug This movie may cause me to never see one of Mel Gibson movie again in fear of it being as bad as this one He needs to be very picky from now one and come up with a good movie to prove he can still act.
