This book is the transition between children's book and not-so-children's book. The darkest of the books to this point. This is also the point where reading the book AND watching the movie is crucial. While the first two movies fairly accurately cover the important details of the first two books, the PoA is a longer book, thus more difficult to cover in a movie of a tolerable length. The book includes many a detail that is basically just glossed over in the movie, such as quiddich being a huge part of the book (Oliver Wood's rampage to win the tournament before he leaves is very entertaining) among other things.
