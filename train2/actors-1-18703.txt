Peter Jackson, director of Bad Taste (1987) and Meet the Feebles (1989). I know that the only reason he's on this list is because he is the director of three films that haven't been released yet, and that isn't fair to the other directors. Sorry guys. I highly doubt that The Lord of the Rings will be the best movie ever.
