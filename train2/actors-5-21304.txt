My fave movie by her at the moment is A Cinderella Story but I'm not dissing her or anything but i dont think it wud of got as far without Chad in it. ;-). Neway i'm sick of all the people calling her!! Yer if you don't like her voice, her songs, her concerts, her looks, her clothes, her kovies, her programme, her family HER FAME!! YOu may not be jealous but none of you can surely say sometime in ur life that u wish u had something that she or any other person like her has. Yer she doesnt have a WOW voice or an eye catching voice but i respect what shes doing. She may need 2 sing some more songs for her age (17 is it?) but younger girls probably love her as shes making RESPECTABLE pop music without being half naked. (Dont get me rong im still a fan of britney and ppl!!) But i think your taking it 2 far wen u call her fat!! Like she is so the size of pl like Rik Waller or hueva hes called. Shes not a super skinny model and doesnt want 2 be which is good and she is always positive. Think how many pl u no u cud go thru wat shes been called. Jus lukin on this site proves my point!! U DONT EVEN NO HER! Whihc cud say the same 4 me. She maybe a b*tch but u have no rite 2 call her 1 coz she luks it or sounds it wen she sings!! You shudnt go off otha ppls opinions eg Linsay Lohan. Just becoz they have a feud doenst mean u shud hold grudges on sum1 u dont no! So i hope Hilary keeps goin on with wat shes doing and still stays as a role model to younger girls. X
