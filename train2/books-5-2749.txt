I highly recommend Organizing From the Inside Out. It's different from most books on organization because it encourages you to thoroughly analyze your situation and develop a plan of action before you actually start organizing. By doing this, the author explains that you will be able to maintain the system over time. This makes sense to me. In general, the book is organized by area (e.g. kitchen, home-based business, etc.), making it very easy to use. I utilized the plan to organize one room in my house, and I'm very pleased with the results. I plan to go through my entire house using this system. I have read several other books on organization (most of which were compilations of organization tips), and Organizing From the Inside Out is the first one that has actually helped me to produce results. If you read one book on organization, this should be it.
