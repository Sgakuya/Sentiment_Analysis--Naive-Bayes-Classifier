I think that Sarah Michelle Gellar is the best actress in the world. A lot of people say that they do not like her because of people saying stuff like she's a bitch. In my opinion you would have to be crazy to believe those stupid rumors. People who believe those are just jelous and thinking of reasons to hate her. Well I have to go, but my point is I think she rocks! And every thing she has been in rocks! She is pretty, talented and extremly intelligent. She rocks, and I hope she makes many more movies!!! Anyone who says something mean about her, you suck and you are just jelous of something...
