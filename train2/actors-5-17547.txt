I love Kim Zimmer very much. I have met her two times and each time she treated with kindness and love. I correspond with her frequently. She is tremendously talented in her performances. IMO there is no better actress in the entertainment field. She is talented in her acting, singing, and dancing. She is very kind to her costars and fans. She is real and what you see is what she is. She puts her husband and children first so she has her priorities straight. Kim is the greatest!!!! Rosie Casey
