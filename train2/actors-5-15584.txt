Todd did great in Diff'rent Strokes as the straight man with Gary Coleman possessing most of the funny lines. He'd gotten into drugs later in life (probably stemming from the pressures of being a child celebrity), but now, it seems he's cleaned himself up. He doesn't seem to be acting anymore, as he now has a wife and child -- more than likely devoting his time to his family.
