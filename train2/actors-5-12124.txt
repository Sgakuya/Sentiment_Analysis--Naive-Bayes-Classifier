Katie is my all time favourite. I think she has extreme talent, and her work shows consistency and quality. She's moved away from the popular "Joey" image, and has gotten into much more mature roles. This thing with Tom Cruise has probably dampened her popularity a bit for people who can't seem to look past her personal life, but for those who can focus more on her career, she's amazing.
