A spookily conformist nation where there is no individuality. They also practice a rampant form of consumerism that makes the US look positively 'green' and puritan. Also have little regard for animals, the environment nor other people. Look at their sadistic 'game' shows that pass for 'entertainment'. Also a weird mix of the sexually inhibited that makes the British look like Brazilians and a disturbing perversity re: schoolgirls' underwear.
