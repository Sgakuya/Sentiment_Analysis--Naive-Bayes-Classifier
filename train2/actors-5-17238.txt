Alicia makes a wonderful Kendall. She plays her part so well, that not even Sarah Michelle whats-her-name could do better. She IS Kendall Hart. They did All My Children a huge favor by bringing in Alicia. I also find it pathetic that some people don't like her just because she's skinny. You aren't even basing your rating on her acting ability.....how shallow.
