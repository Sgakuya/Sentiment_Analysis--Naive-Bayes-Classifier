People only hate Susan Sarandon because of her outspoken views about George Bush. Yet people complain about actors not living in the real world and living in their own ecocism!!!??!! Thank goodness there are people like Susan Sarandon who can see beyond their borders in an industry where people think that throwing money at a needy cause is going to solve problems and not wanting to get physically invovled to damage their Jimmy Choo shoes or rip their gucci dress....GIVE ME A BREAK... donating money to a forest makes you humane and down to earth...SPARE ME!!! She's a true humanitarian. Yes fair enough shes not a politican, but at least shes speaking her mind and not wrapped up in her own success thinking of herself and it's not as if her work doesn't speak for itself either Dead Man Walking, Thelma and Louise, The Client the classic Rocky Horror Picture Show and shes one of the few actresses thats growing old gracefully and not injecting every chemical known to man into her face to look deformed (Joan Rivers anyone???)....enough said
