This review is for the credit card, not the bank. (I'm a member of the bank and like the bank.) I pay off my balance every month and have done this for years without a problem. I get the wachovia card and the problems begin. First of all you only have 25 days to pay. Discover and capital one give you an entire month. Those 6 extra days do become important. Last month they send me the bill which arrives over a week after the statement date. I go away. I come back home pay the bill and now I'm late by one day. $25 charge. I've never had a late fee before. I cancelled the card and will never have one with them again. they didn't even seem interested in keeping me as a customer!
