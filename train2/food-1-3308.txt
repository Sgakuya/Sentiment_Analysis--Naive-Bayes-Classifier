It stinks my mom bought it for me and i saw fried fat chunks in the chicken the macaroni was to scary to talk about let alone eat. the corn must of supplied the drinking part because it was 2 centimeters deep in corn juice (no it wasn't butter)The people who said it was good and eat it will probably live to the age of 31 and have a heart-attack and die. The browny was the only good thing in there except for the fact it was as dry as the Sahara Desert. The chicken nuggets, man when i took them out they were soaking wet. The only thing i was able to eat was the frosting. The problem with your ratings is the people who rate them haven't eaten them they jugde by their kids who might be lying or their taste buds have not developed fully so here is a kid who has a thoughtful opinion about these frozen dinners. Oh and please put negative numbers on the rating scale or at least for Kid Cuisine.
