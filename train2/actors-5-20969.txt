KIrstie I love you!!!! You are a talented, determined feisty actress with a brain who is so much fun to watch! I wish you were back in movies though because I don't really watch sitcoms at all. I loved all your movies except Sibling Rivalry. All the Look Who's Talking films are great. Even though Im not a sitcom fan, I have to say that you and Ted Danson were hot together in Cheers!!!
