Serius' customer service was outrageous. I purchased a radio for my husband for Christmas and everything was fine the first day. After the first day he was not getting any reception for over half his stations. We called serius and asked them to help us or maybe send us a new antennae. No one wanted to help us, or even point us in the right direction! We were put on hold over ten times ...sometimes for twenty minutes at a time! After spending over an hour and a half on the phone trying to get some answers they gave us another number to call! We called that number over twenty times and all we got was a busy signal. The next day I called and after specifically telling them the number was only giving me a busy signal he put me on hold for another twenty minutes and then transfered me straight to the busy signal again! That day I went out with my husband and returned the radio and bought him XM. WONDERFUL! It was up and running in no time and they were great. Ohh and of course I had to wait another ten minutes on hold the next day when I called to cancel my serius service. WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD.
