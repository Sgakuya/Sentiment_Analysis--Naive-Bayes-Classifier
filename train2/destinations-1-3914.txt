Please. Spare the BS people. Pittsburgh is one of the most racist and bigoted cities you will ever see. THe people live in the 1950s and try to keep things the same and resist any possibility of change. Subway systems goes South of the city and that is it. It is definitely NOT extensive. It is the laughing stock of all people who have ever used a subway. The economy is depressed and the city is filthy and nasty and utterly boring. Everyone my age is looking to get out of Pittsburgh as fast as posible. Most Livable City is a joke. It is livable because it is cheap and it is cheap because there are no jobs and the economy is beyond depressed. The people here are still waiting for Steel to make a comeback. Best advice you will ever hear: Get out of PIttsburgh as quick as you can or yuo will be stuck here forever to live a miserable and boring life.
