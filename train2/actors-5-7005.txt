I have watch him for years. His talent is beyond that of many of today's young actors. The passion he exploded into his role in American Beauty is only amplified when you are graced with the chance to see him do live theather. I am very proud of him and all his friends and family feel the same, if your a fan today of Wes' you will be for a long time to come. Deb (dvoss@lycos.com)
