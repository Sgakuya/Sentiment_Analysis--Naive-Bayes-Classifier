It says a lot when an actor goes to the WCW and is practically given the wrestling heavyweight title for doing nothing, and vice versa. Either way, David Arquette is the equivalent of the infamous 'Typhoid' Mary in how anything he comes across is literally infected and ruined, thereafter. Though he might be a nice guy (he seems to be), he cannot act whatsoever. Arquette ought to just stick to doing commercials since he can be funny at times.
