A delightful person and actress. I loved her most in the remake of Out Of Towners with Steve Martin. She seems like a really kind and nice person. She is a beloved Mom. So some folks are dissin her because she is aging? Like who is not? She is still really a cute person. So let me see - Women have to look 25 forever and Men can age? What cr!p.
