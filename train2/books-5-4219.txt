This is a compulsory read when studying literature. I find it to be one of the best character analyses of a teenager of all time. Many teenage novels tend to sugarcoat or overdramatize their lives. This book makes a very realistic approach to a depressed teenage boy. This book applies to all people because Holden isn't abnormal at all. I think every adult person can relate to him and his feelings at some level.
