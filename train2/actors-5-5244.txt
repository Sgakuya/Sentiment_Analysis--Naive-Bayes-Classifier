Much to Bob's credit, he wouldn't give a damn about this simple little poll.....I just can't bear to see him ranked below the likes of Mike Myers, Ralph Fiennes, Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson! It's just a matter of preference, I know. But RR's been under-rated, and for far too long. Call it a personal vendetta.
