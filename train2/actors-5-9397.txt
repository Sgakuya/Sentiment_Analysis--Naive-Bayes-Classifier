She always has been a good actress. She was very good as a child actress always convincing and never once going for cutesy she was wonderful as a child prostitute in Taxi Driver. and into her adult years she has done some very good roles. Silence of the Lambs, the Accused etc. A good director as well. I liked the movie Little Man Tate. that she directed.
