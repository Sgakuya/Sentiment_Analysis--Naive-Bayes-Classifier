Lauren Bacall is a wonderfull actress and I hope Hollywood won't be foolish and stop giving her great parts. She is a fine whine that only gets better with age! I loved her in The Mirror Has Two Faces. That film would only have been half as good without her in it. I hope to see her in a great role in a feature film soon. What about an older Erin Brockovich type of role? Or, if a comedy, a wealthy, snobbish society matron, who discovers she is penniless after her husband dies, and is forced to live among the common people in a modest senior's apartment complex?
