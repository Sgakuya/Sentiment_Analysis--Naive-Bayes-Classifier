Bill Mumy was one of the best and most natural child actors of the 1960's. I wasn't alive back then so I've seen him in episodes shown in syndication. The first thing I saw him in was a very creepy episode of The Twilight Zone in which the town's people had to make Bill Mumy happy. He was so creepy in that episode. The scene where he turned a man into a jack in the box was memorable. I also loved him in a couple episodes of Bewitched especially the one where he mimics Dick York. It is hysterical. He was a true talent of a child actor.
