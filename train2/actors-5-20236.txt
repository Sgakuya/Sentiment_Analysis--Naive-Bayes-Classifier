I was debating between giving a 4 or a 5 but I guess I'll go with 5 cause I like her more than a few of the girls higher up on the list. The reason I was debating was cause she doesn't seem to have a lot of versatility. She seems like a really nice person and she can pull of dramatic scenes very well, and I love the way she always has such a unique and endearing way of saying her lines (as a fresh change from the stereotypical, overacting way of saying dramatic lines). I don't think she's one of the more finely-tuned actresses out there, but she seems down-to-earth and I really do enjoy watching her perform.
