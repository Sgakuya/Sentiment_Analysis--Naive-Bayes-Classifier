Just go see Cape Fear! This guy is really scary! The new version with Mickey R. is a joke. Mitchum was a real tough guy, always getting into fights and landing in jail. If he was around today he would eat people like bad boy Sean Pean for breakfast. For example he got into a fight one night in a bar and knocked out a well known boxer.
